I think it's safe to say that all humans will be intimate with death at least once in their lives. But what if that intimacy began long before you faced your own transition from life into death  What would life be like if the dead literally lived alongside you  In my husband's homeland in the highlands of Sulawesi island in eastern Indonesia  there is a community of people that experience death not as a singular event but as a gradual social process. In Tana Toraja  the most important social moments in people's lives  the focal points of social and cultural interaction are not weddings or births or even family dinners  but funerals. So these funerals are characterized by elaborate rituals that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt based on the amount of animals    pigs  chickens and  most importantly  water buffalo    that are sacrificed and distributed in the name of the deceased. So this cultural complex surrounding death  the ritual enactment of the end of life  has made death the most visible and remarkable aspect of Toraja's landscape. Lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks  funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair  where commemorating someone who's died is not so much a private sadness but more of a publicly shared transition. And it's a transition that's just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remembrance of the dead. So every year  thousands of visitors come to Tana Toraja to see  as it were  this culture of death  and for many people these grandiose ceremonies and the length of the ceremonies are somehow incommensurable with the way that we face our own mortality in the West. So even as we share death as a universal experience  it's not experienced the same way the world over. And as an anthropologist  I see these differences in experience being rooted in the cultural and social world through which we define the phenomena around us. So where we see an unquestionable reality  death as an irrefutable biological condition  Torajans see the expired corporeal form as part of a larger social genesis. So again  the physical cessation of life is not the same as death. In fact  a member of society is only truly dead when the extended family can agree upon and marshal the resources necessary to hold a funeral ceremony that is considered appropriate in terms of resources for the status of the deceased. And this ceremony has to take place in front of the eyes of the whole community with everyone's participation. So after a person's physical death  their body is placed in a special room in the traditional residence  which is called the tongkonan. And the tongkonan is symbolic not only of the family's identity but also of the human life cycle from birth to death. So essentially  the shape of the building that you're born into is the shape of the structure which carries you to your ancestral resting place. Until the funeral ceremony  which can be held years after a person's physical death  the deceased is referred to as  to makala   a sick person  or  to mama   a person who is asleep  and they continue to be a member of the household. They are symbolically fed and cared for  and the family at this time will begin a number of ritual injunctions  which communicates to the wider community around them that one of their members is undergoing the transition from this life into the afterlife known as Puya. So I know what some of you must be thinking right now. Is she really saying that these people live with the bodies of their dead relatives  And that's exactly what I'm saying. But instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction we have to this idea of proximity to bodies  proximity to death  or how this notion just does not fit into our very biological or medical sort of definition of death  I like to think about what the Torajan way of viewing death encompasses of the human experience that the medical definition leaves out. I think that Torajans socially recognize and culturally express what many of us feel to be true despite the widespread acceptance of the biomedical definition of death  and that is that our relationships with other humans  their impact on our social reality  doesn't cease with the termination of the physical processes of the body  that there's a period of transition as the relationship between the living and the dead is transformed but not ended. So Torajans express this idea of this enduring relationship by lavishing love and attention on the most visible symbol of that relationship  the human body. So my husband has fond memories of talking to and playing with and generally being around his deceased grandfather  and for him there is nothing unnatural about this. This is a natural part of the process as the family comes to terms with the transition in their relationship to the deceased  and this is the transition from relating to the deceased as a person who's living to relating to the deceased as a person who's an ancestor. And here you can see these wooden effigies of the ancestors  so these are people who have already been buried  already had a funeral ceremony. These are called tau tau. So the funeral ceremony itself embodies this relational perspective on death. It ritualizes the impact of death on families and communities. And it's also a moment of self awareness. It's a moment when people think about who they are  their place in society  and their role in the life cycle in accordance with Torajan cosmology. There's a saying in Toraja that all people will become grandparents  and what this means is that after death  we all become part of the ancestral line that anchors us between the past and the present and will define who our loved ones are into the future. So essentially  we all become grandparents to the generations of human children that come after us. And this metaphor of membership in the greater human family is the way that children also describe the money that they invest in these sacrificial buffaloes that are thought to carry people's soul from here to the afterlife  and children will explain that they will invest the money in this because they want to repay their parents the debt for all of the years their parents spent investing and caring for them. But the sacrifice of buffalo and the ritual display of wealth also exhibits the status of the deceased  and  by extension  the deceased's family. So at funerals  relationships are reconfirmed but also transformed in a ritual drama that highlights the most salient feature about death in this place  its impact on life and the relationships of the living. So all of this focus on death doesn't mean that Torajans don't aspire to the ideal of a long life. They engage in many practices thought to confer good health and survival to an advanced age. But they don't put much stock in efforts to prolong life in the face of debilitating illness or in old age. It's said in Toraja that everybody has sort of a predetermined amount of life. It's called the sunga'. And like a thread  it should be allowed to unspool to its natural end. So by having death as a part of the cultural and social fabric of life  people's everyday decisions about their health and healthcare are affected. The patriarch of my husband's maternal clan  Nenet Katcha  is now approaching the age of      as far as we can tell. And there are increasing signs that he is about to depart on his own journey for Puya. And his death will be greatly mourned. But I know that my husband's family looks forward to the moment when they can ritually display what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives  when they can ritually recount his life's narrative  weaving his story into the history of their community. His story is their story. His funeral songs will sing them a song about themselves. And it's a story that has no discernible beginning  no foreseeable end. It's a story that goes on long after his body no longer does. People ask me if I'm frightened or repulsed by participating in a culture where the physical manifestations of death greet us at every turn. But I see something profoundly transformative in experiencing death as a social process and not just a biological one. In reality  the relationship between the living and the dead has its own drama in the U.S. healthcare system  where decisions about how long to stretch the thread of life are made based on our emotional and social ties with the people around us  not just on medicine's ability to prolong life. We  like the Torajans  base our decisions about life on the meanings and the definitions that we ascribe to death. So I'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience should run out and adopt the traditions of the Torajans. It might be a little bit difficult to put into play in the United States. But I want to ask what we can gain from seeing physical death not only as a biological process but as part of the greater human story. What would it be like to look on the expired human form with love because it's so intimately a part of who we all are  If we could expand our definition of death to encompass life  we could experience death as part of life and perhaps face death with something other than fear. Perhaps one of the answers to the challenges that are facing the U.S. healthcare system  particularly in the end of life care  is as simple as a shift in perspective  and the shift in perspective in this case would be to look at the social life of every death. It might help us recognize that the way we limit our conversation about death to something that's medical or biological is reflective of a larger culture that we all share of avoiding death  being afraid of talking about it. If we could entertain and value other kinds of knowledge about life  including other definitions of death  it has the potential to change the discussions that we have about the end of life. It could change the way that we die  but more importantly  it could transform the way that we live. So my name is Amy Webb  and a few years ago I found myself at the end of yet another fantastic relationship that came burning down in a spectacular fashion. And I thought  what's wrong with me  I don't understand why this keeps happening. So I asked everybody in my life what they thought. I turned to my grandmother  who always had plenty of advice  and she said   Stop being so picky. You've got to date around. And most importantly  true love will find you when you least expect it.  Now as it turns out  I'm somebody who thinks a lot about data  as you'll soon find. I am constantly swimming in numbers  formulas and charts. I also have a very tight knit family  and I'm very  very close with my sister  and as a result  I wanted to have the same type of family when I grew up. So I'm at the end of this bad breakup  I'm    years old  I figure I'm probably going to have to date somebody for about six months before I'm ready to get monogamous and before we can sort of cohabitate  and we have to do that for a while before we can get engaged. And if I want to start having children by the time I'm     that meant that I would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago. So that wasn't going to work. If my strategy was to least expect my way into true love  then the variable that I had to deal with was serendipity. In short  I was trying to figure out what's the probability of my finding Mr. Right  Well  at the time I was living in the city of Philadelphia  and it's a big city  and I figured  in this entire place  there are lots of possibilities. So again  I started doing some math. Population of Philadelphia  it has  .  million people. I figure about half of that are men  so that takes the number down to        . I'm looking for a guy between the ages of    and     which was only four percent of the population  so now I'm dealing with the possibility of        men. I was looking for somebody who was Jewish  because I am and that was important to me. That's only  .  percent of the population. I figure I'm attracted to maybe one out of    of those men  and there was no way I was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer. So that basically meant there were    men for me that I could possibly date in the entire city of Philadelphia. In the meantime  my very large Jewish family was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children  and I felt like I was under tremendous peer pressure to get my life going already. So I have two possible strategies at this point I'm sort of figuring out. One  I can take my grandmother's advice and sort of least expect my way into maybe bumping into the one out of    possible men in the entire  .  million person city of Philadelphia  or I could try online dating. Now  I like the idea of online dating  because it's predicated on an algorithm  and that's really just a simple way of saying I've got a problem  I'm going to use some data  run it through a system and get to a solution. So online dating is the second most popular way that people now meet each other  but as it turns out  algorithms have been around for thousands of years in almost every culture. In fact  in Judaism  there were matchmakers a long time ago  and though they didn't have an explicit algorithm per se  they definitely were running through formulas in their heads  like  is the girl going to like the boy  Are the families going to get along  What's the rabbi going to say  Are they going to start having children right away  The matchmaker would sort of think through all of this  put two people together  and that would be the end of it. So in my case  I thought  well  will data and an algorithm lead me to my Prince Charming  So I decided to sign on. Now  there was one small catch. As I'm signing on to the various dating websites  as it happens  I was really  really busy. But that actually wasn't the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that I hate filling out questionnaires of any kind  and I certainly don't like questionnaires that are like Cosmo quizzes. So I just copied and pasted from my r sum . So in the descriptive part up top  I said that I was an award winning journalist and a future thinker. When I was asked about fun activities and my ideal date  I said monetization and fluency in Japanese. I talked a lot about JavaScript. So obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward. But the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date. These algorithms had a sea full of men that wanted to take me out on lots of dates    what turned out to be truly awful dates. There was this guy Steve  the I.T. guy. The algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets  we share a love of math and data and '  s music  and so I agreed to go out with him. So Steve the I.T. guy invited me out to one of Philadelphia's white table cloth  extremely expensive restaurants. And we went in  and right off the bat  our conversation really wasn't taking flight  but he was ordering a lot of food. In fact  he didn't even bother looking at the menu. He was ordering multiple appetizers  multiple entr es  for me as well  and suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table  also lots and lots of bottles of wine. So we're nearing the end of our conversation and the end of dinner  and I've decided Steve the I.T. guy and I are really just not meant for each other  but we'll part ways as friends  when he gets up to go to the bathroom  and in the meantime  the bill comes to our table. And listen  I'm a modern woman. I am totally down with splitting the bill. But then Steve the I.T. guy didn't come back. And that was my entire month's rent. So needless to say  I was not having a good night. So I run home  I call my mother  I call my sister  and as I do  at the end of each one of these terrible  terrible dates  I regale them with the details. And they say to me   Stop complaining.   You're just being too picky.  So I said  fine  from here on out I'm only going on dates where I know there's Wi Fi  and I'm bringing my laptop. I'm going to shove it into my bag  I'm going to have this email template  and I'm going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically  these dates really are terrible. So I started tracking things like really stupid  awkward  sexual remarks  bad vocabulary  the number of times a man forced me to high five him. So I started to crunch some numbers  and that allowed me to make some correlations. So as it turns out  for some reason  men who drink Scotch reference kinky sex immediately. Well  it turns out that these probably weren't bad guys. There were just bad for me. And as it happens  the algorithms that were setting us up  they weren't bad either. These algorithms were doing exactly what they were designed to do  which was to take our user generated information  in my case  my r sum   and match it up with other people's information. See  the real problem here is that  while the algorithms work just fine  you and I don't  when confronted with blank windows where we're supposed to input our information online. Very few of us have the ability to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves. The other problem is that these websites are asking us questions like  are you a dog person or a cat person  Do you like horror films or romance films  I'm not looking for a pen pal. I'm looking for a husband. Right  So there's a certain amount of superficiality in that data. So I said fine  I've got a new plan. I'm going to keep using these online dating sites  but I'm going to treat them as databases  and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up  I think I'm going to try reverse engineering this entire system. So knowing that there was superficial data that was being used to match me up with other people  I decided instead to ask my own questions. What was every single possible thing that I could think of that I was looking for in a mate  So I started writing and writing and writing  and at the end  I had amassed    different data points. I wanted somebody was Jew ish  so I was looking for somebody who had the same background and thoughts on our culture  but wasn't going to force me to go to shul every Friday and Saturday. I wanted somebody who worked hard  because work for me is extremely important  but not too hard. For me  the hobbies that I have are really just new work projects that I've launched. I also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children  but was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that I do  so somebody who was going to be totally okay with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three  and also maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it. So things like that  but I also wanted somebody who would go to far flung  exotic places  like Petra  Jordan. I also wanted somebody who would weigh    pounds more than me at all times  regardless of what I weighed. So I now have these    different data points  which  to be fair  is a lot. So what I did was  I went through and I prioritized that list. I broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points  and I ranked everything starting at     and going all the way down to     and listing things like I was looking for somebody who was really smart  who would challenge and stimulate me  and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points. These things were also important to me but not necessarily deal breakers. So once I had all this done  I then built a scoring system  because what I wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate whether or not I thought the guy that I found online would be a match with me. I figured there would be a minimum of     points before I would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message. For     points  I'd agree to go out on a date  and I wouldn't even consider any kind of relationship before somebody had crossed the       point threshold. Well  as it turns out  this worked pretty well. So I go back online now. I found Jewishdoc   who's incredibly good looking  incredibly well spoken  he had hiked Mt. Fuji  he had walked along the Great Wall. He likes to travel as long as it doesn't involve a cruise ship. And I thought  I've done it  I've cracked the code. I have just found the Jewish Prince Charming of my family's dreams. There was only one problem  He didn't like me back. And I guess the one variable that I haven't considered is the competition. Who are all of the other women on these dating sites  I found SmileyGirl    . She said she was a  Fun girl who is Happy and Outgoing.  She listed her job as  teacher.  She said she is  silly  nice and friendly.  She likes to make people laugh  alot.  At this moment I knew  clicking profile after profile that looked like this  that I needed to do some market research. So I created    fake male profiles. Now  before I lose all of you    understand that I did this strictly to gather data about everybody else in the system. I didn't carry on crazy Catfish style relationships with anybody. I really was just scraping their data. But I didn't want everybody's data. I only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted to the type of man that I really  really wanted to marry. When I released these men into the wild  I did follow some rules. So I didn't reach out to any woman first. I just waited to see who these profiles were going to attract  and mainly what I was looking at was two different data sets. So I was looking at qualitative data  so what was the humor  the tone  the voice  the communication style that these women shared in common  And also quantitative data  so what was the average length of their profile  how much time was spent between messages  What I was trying to get at here was that I figured  in person  I would be just as competitive as a SmileyGirl    . I wanted to figure out how to maximize my own profile online. Well  one month later  I had a lot of data  and I was able to do another analysis. And as it turns out  content matters a lot. So smart people tend to write a lot                        words about themselves  which may all be very  very interesting. The challenge here  though  is that the popular men and women are sticking to    words on average that are written very  very well  even though it may not seem like it all the time. The other hallmark of the people who do this well is that they're using non specific language. So in my case   The English Patient  is my most favorite movie ever  but it doesn't work to use that in a profile  because that's a superficial data point  and somebody may disagree and decide they don't want to go out because they didn't like sitting through the three hour movie. Also  optimistic language matters a lot. So this is a word cloud highlighting the most popular words that were used by the most popular women  words like  fun  and  girl  and  love.  And what I realized was not that I had to dumb down my own profile. Remember  I'm somebody who said that I speak fluent Japanese and I know JavaScript and I was okay with that. The difference is that it's about being more approachable and helping people understand the best way to reach out to you. And as it turns out  timing is also really  really important. Just because you have access to somebody's mobile phone number or their instant message account and it's   o'clock in the morning and you happen to be awake  doesn't mean that that's a good time to communicate with those people. The popular women on these online sites spend an average of    hours in between each communication. And that's what we would normally do in the usual process of courtship. And finally    there were the photos. All of the women who were popular showed some skin. They all looked really great  which turned out to be in sharp contrast to what I had uploaded. Once I had all of this information  I was able to create a super profile  so it was still me  but it was me optimized now for this ecosystem. And as it turns out  I did a really good job. I was the most popular person online. And as it turns out  lots and lots of men wanted to date me. So I call my mom  I call my sister  I call my grandmother. I'm telling them about this fabulous news  and they say   This is wonderful  How soon are you going out   I said   Actually  I'm not going to go out with anybody.  Because remember  in my scoring system  they have to reach a minimum threshold of     points  and none of them have done that. They said   What  You're still being too damn picky.  Well  not too long after that  I found this guy  Thevenin  and he said that he was culturally Jewish  he said that his job was an arctic baby seal hunter  which I thought was very clever. He talked in detail about travel. He made a lot of really interesting cultural references. He looked and talked exactly like what I wanted  and immediately  he scored     points. It was enough for a date. Three weeks later  we met up in person for what turned out to be a    hour long conversation that went from coffee shop to restaurant to another coffee shop to another restaurant  and when he dropped me back off at my house that night I re scored him           points   Thought  you know what  this entire time  I haven't been picky enough. Well  a year and a half after that  we were non cruise ship traveling through Petra  Jordan  when he got down on his knee and proposed. A year after that  we were married  and about a year and a half after that  our daughter  Petra  was born. Audience  Oh   What it means...  Obviously  I'm having a fabulous life  so    The question is  what does all of this mean for you  Well  as it turns out  there is an algorithm for love. It's just not the ones that we're being presented with online. In fact  it's something that you write yourself. So whether you're looking for a husband or a wife or you're trying to find your passion or you're trying to start a business  all you have to really do is figure out your own framework and play by your own rules  and feel free to be as picky as you want. Well  on my wedding day  I had a conversation again with my grandmother  and she said   All right  maybe I was wrong. It looks like you did come up with a really  really great system. Now  your matzah balls ... They should be fluffy  not hard.  And I'll take her advice on that. An image is worth more than a thousand words  so I'm going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few images that I recently captured. So by now  my talk is already       words long  and I feel like I should stop here. At the same time  I probably owe you some explanation about the images that you just saw. What I am trying to do as a photographer  as an artist  is to bring the world of art and science together. Whether it is an image of a soap bubble captured at the very moment where it's bursting  as you can see in this image  whether it's a universe made of tiny little beads of oil paint  strange liquids that behave in very peculiar ways  or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces  I'm always trying to link those two fields together. What I find very intriguing about those two is that they both look at the same thing  They are a response to their surroundings. And yet  they do it in a very different way. If you look at science on one hand  science is a very rational approach to its surroundings  whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings. What I am trying to do is I'm trying to bring those two views into one so that my images both speak to the viewer's heart but also to the viewer's brain. Let me demonstrate this based on three projects. The first one has to do with making sound visible. Now as you may know  sound travels in waves  so if you have a speaker  a speaker actually does nothing else than taking the audio signal  transform it into a vibration  which is then transported through the air  is captured by our ear  and transformed into an audio signal again. Now I was thinking  how can I make those sound waves visible  So I came up with the following setup. I took a speaker  I placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker  and then I added tiny little crystals on top of that speaker. And now  if I would play a sound through that speaker  it would cause the crystals to move up and down. Now this happens very fast  in the blink of an eye  so  together with LG  we captured this motion with a camera that is able to capture more than       frames per second. Let me show you what this looks like. Thank you very much. I agree  it looks pretty amazing. But I have to tell you a funny story. I got an indoor sunburn doing this while shooting in Los Angeles. Now in Los Angeles  you could get a decent sunburn just on any of the beaches  but I got mine indoors  and what happened is that  if you're shooting at       frames per second  you need to have a silly amount of light  lots of lights. So we had this speaker set up  and we had the camera facing it  and lots of lights pointing at the speaker  and I would set up the speaker  put the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker  and we would do this over and over again  and it was until midday that I realized that I had a completely red face because of the lights pointing at the speaker. What was so funny about it was that the speaker was only coming from the right side  so the right side of my face was completely red and I looked like the Phantom of the Opera for the rest of the week. Let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances. Has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid  Ah  some of you have. Excellent. Should I skip that part  Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior. It's a liquid that is completely black. It's got an oily consistency. And it's got tiny little particles of metal in it  which makes it magnetic. So if I now put this liquid into a magnetic field  it would change its appearance. Now I've got a live demonstration over here to show this to you. So I've got a camera pointing down at this plate  and underneath that plate  there is a magnet. Now I'm going to add some of that ferrofluid to that magnet. Let's just slightly move it to the right and maybe focus it a little bit more. Excellent. So what you can see now is that the ferrofluid has formed spikes. This is due to the attraction and the repulsion of the individual particles inside the liquid. Now this looks already quite interesting  but let me now add some watercolors to it. Those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with. You wouldn't paint with syringes  but it works just the same. So what happened now is  when the watercolor was flowing into the structure  the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid. That's because the ferrofluid itself is hydrophobic. That means it doesn't mix with the water. And at the same time  it tries to maintain its position above the magnet  and therefore  it creates those amazing looking structures of channels and tiny little ponds of colorful water paint. So that was the second project. Let me now turn to the last project  which involves the national beverage of Scotland. This image  and also this one  were made using whiskey. Now you might ask yourself  how did he do that  Did he drink half a bottle of whiskey and then draw the hallucination he got from being drunk onto paper  I can assure you I was fully conscious while I was taking those pictures. Now  whiskey contains    percent of alcohol  and alcohol has got some very interesting properties. Maybe you have experienced some of those properties before  but I am talking about the physical properties  not the other ones. So when I open the bottle  the alcohol molecules would spread in the air  and that's because alcohol is a very volatile substance. And at the same time  alcohol is highly flammable. And it was with those two properties that I was able to create the images that you're seeing right now. Let me demonstrate this over here. And what I have here is an empty glass vessel. It's got nothing in it. And now I'm going to fill it with oxygen and whiskey. Add some more. Now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle. And now  let's set that on fire. So that's all that happens. It goes really fast  and it's not that impressive. I could do it again to show it one more time  but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey  and that I should rather drink it. But let me show you a slow motion in a completely darkened room of what I just showed you in this live demonstration. So what happened is that the flame traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom  burning the mix of the air molecules and the alcohol. So the images that you saw at the beginning  they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle  and you have to imagine it was flipped around     degrees. So that's how those images were made. Thank you. So  I have now showed you three projects  and you might ask yourself  what is it good for  What's the idea behind it  Is it just a waste of whiskey  Is it just some strange materials  Those three projects  they're based on very simple scientific phenomena  such as magnetism  the sound waves  or over here  the physical properties of a substance  and what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to use these phenomena and show them in a poetic and unseen way  and therefore invite the viewer to pause for a moment and think about all the beauty that is constantly surrounding us. Thank you very much. So  we used to solve big problems. On July   st        Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo   's lunar module and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility. Armstrong and Aldrin were alone  but their presence on the moon's gray surface was the culmination of a convulsive  collective effort. The Apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the history of the United States. To get to the moon  NASA spent around     billion dollars in today's money  or four percent of the federal budget. Apollo employed around         people and demanded the collaboration of        companies  universities and government agencies. People died  including the crew of Apollo  . But before the Apollo program ended     men flew to the moon. Twelve walked on its surface  of whom Aldrin  following the death of Armstrong last year  is now the most senior. So why did they go  They didn't bring much back      pounds of old rocks  and something all    later emphasized    a new sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home. Why did they go  The cynical answer is they went because President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets. But Kennedy's own words at Rice University in      provide a better clue. Why choose this as our goal  And they may well ask  why climb the highest mountain  Why     years ago  fly the Atlantic  Why does Rice play Texas  We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade  and do the other things  not because they are easy  but because they are hard. Jason Pontin  To contemporaries  Apollo wasn't only a victory of West over East in the Cold War. At the time  the strongest emotion was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology. They went because it was a big thing to do. Landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs. The first half of the   th century produced the assembly line and the airplane  penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis. In the middle years of the century  polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated. Technology itself seemed to possess what Alvin Toffler in      called  accelerative thrust.  For most of human history  we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail  but in       the crew of Apollo    flew at        miles an hour. Since       no human beings have been back to the moon. No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo     and blithe optimism about technology's powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve  such as going to Mars  creating clean energy  curing cancer  or feeding the world have come to seem intractably hard. I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo   . I was five years old  and my mother told me not to stare at the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket. I vaguely knew this was to be the last of the moon missions  but I was absolutely certain there would be Mars colonies in my lifetime. So  Something happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology  has become a commonplace. You hear it all the time. We've heard it over the last two days here at TED. It feels as if technologists have diverted us and enriched themselves with trivial toys  with things like iPhones and apps and social media  or algorithms that speed automated trading. There's nothing wrong with most of these things. They've expanded and enriched our lives. But they don't solve humanity's big problems. What happened  So there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley  which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it financed Intel  Microsoft  Apple and Genentech. Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame  in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs. Silicon Valley says that venture investing shifted away from funding transformational ideas and towards funding incremental problems or even fake problems. But I don't think that explanation is good enough. It mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley. Even when venture capitalists were at their most risk happy  they preferred small investments  tiny investments that offered an exit within    years. V.C.s have always struggled to invest profitably in technologies such as energy whose capital requirements are huge and whose development is long and lengthy  and V.C.s have never  never funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that possess no immediate commercial value. No  the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and more profound. Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems. We could go to Mars if we want. NASA even has the outline of a plan. But going to Mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal  and that will never happen. We won't go to Mars  because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on Earth. Sometimes  we can't solve big problems because our political systems fail. Today  less than two percent of the world's energy consumption derives from advanced  renewable sources such as solar  wind and biofuels  less than two percent  and the reason is purely economic. Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind  and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels. We want alternative energy sources that can compete on price. None exist. Now  technologists  business leaders and economists all basically agree on what national policies and international treaties would spur the development of alternative energy  mostly  a significant increase in energy research and development  and some kind of price on carbon. But there's no hope in the present political climate that we will see U.S. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus. Sometimes  big problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so. Famines were long understood to be caused by failures in food supply. But    years of research have taught us that famines are political crises that catastrophically affect food distribution. Technology can improve things like crop yields or systems for storing and transporting food  but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments. Finally  big problems sometimes elude solution because we don't really understand the problem. President Nixon declared war on cancer in       but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer  most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy  and it is only in the last    years that effective  viable therapies have come to seem real. Hard problems are hard. It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology. We can  we must  but these four elements must all be present  Political leaders and the public must care to solve a problem  institutions must support its solution  It must really be a technological problem  and we must understand it. The Apollo mission  which has become a kind of metaphor for technology's capacity to solve big problems  met these criteria. But it is an irreproducible model for the future. It is not     . There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War  no politician like John Kennedy who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous  and no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring the solar system. Most of all  going to the moon turned out to be easy. It was just three days away. And arguably it wasn't even solving much of a problem. We are left alone with our day  and the solutions of the future will be harder won. God knows  we don't lack for the challenges. Thank you very much. I think we're all aware that the world today is full of problems. We've been hearing them today and yesterday and every day for decades. Serious problems  big problems  pressing problems. Poor nutrition  access to water  climate change  deforestation  lack of skills  insecurity  not enough food  not enough healthcare  pollution. There's problem after problem  and I think what really separates this time from any time I can remember in my brief time on Earth is the awareness of these problems. We're all very aware. Why are we having so much trouble dealing with these problems  That's the question I've been struggling with  coming from my very different perspective. I'm not a social problem guy. I'm a guy that works with business  helps business make money. God forbid. So why are we having so many problems with these social problems  and really is there any role for business  and if so  what is that role  I think that in order to address that question  we have to step back and think about how we've understood and pondered both the problems and the solutions to these great social challenges that we face. Now  I think many have seen business as the problem  or at least one of the problems  in many of the social challenges we face. You know  think of the fast food industry  the drug industry  the banking industry. You know  this is a low point in the respect for business. Business is not seen as the solution. It's seen as the problem now  for most people. And rightly so  in many cases. There's a lot of bad actors out there that have done the wrong thing  that actually have made the problem worse. So this perspective is perhaps justified. How have we tended to see the solutions to these social problems  these many issues that we face in society  Well  we've tended to see the solutions in terms of NGOs  in terms of government  in terms of philanthropy. Indeed  the kind of unique organizational entity of this age is this tremendous rise of NGOs and social organizations. This is a unique  new organizational form that we've seen grown up. Enormous innovation  enormous energy  enormous talent now has been mobilized through this structure to try to deal with all of these challenges. And many of us here are deeply involved in that. I'm a business school professor  but I've actually founded  I think  now  four nonprofits. Whenever I got interested and became aware of a societal problem  that was what I did  form a nonprofit. That was the way we've thought about how to deal with these issues. Even a business school professor has thought about it that way. But I think at this moment  we've been at this for quite a while. We've been aware of these problems for decades. We have decades of experience with our NGOs and with our government entities  and there's an awkward reality. The awkward reality is we're not making fast enough progress. We're not winning. These problems still seem very daunting and very intractable  and any solutions we're achieving are small solutions. We're making incremental progress. What's the fundamental problem we have in dealing with these social problems  If we cut all the complexity away  we have the problem of scale. We can't scale. We can make progress. We can show benefits. We can show results. We can make things better. We're helping. We're doing better. We're doing good. We can't scale. We can't make a large scale impact on these problems. Why is that  Because we don't have the resources. And that's really clear now. And that's clearer now than it's been for decades. There's simply not enough money to deal with any of these problems at scale using the current model. There's not enough tax revenue  there's not enough philanthropic donations  to deal with these problems the way we're dealing with them now. We've got to confront that reality. And the scarcity of resources for dealing with these problems is only growing  certainly in the advanced world today  with all the fiscal problems we face. So if it's fundamentally a resource problem  where are the resources in society  How are those resources really created  the resources we're going to need to deal with all these societal challenges  Well there  I think the answer is very clear  They're in business. All wealth is actually created by business. Business creates wealth when it meets needs at a profit. That's how all wealth is created. It's meeting needs at a profit that leads to taxes and that leads to incomes and that leads to charitable donations. That's where all the resources come from. Only business can actually create resources. Other institutions can utilize them to do important work  but only business can create them. And business creates them when it's able to meet a need at a profit. The resources are overwhelmingly generated by business. The question then is  how do we tap into this  How do we tap into this  Business generates those resources when it makes a profit. That profit is that small difference between the price and the cost it takes to produce whatever solution business has created to whatever problem they're trying to solve. But that profit is the magic. Why  Because that profit allows whatever solution we've created to be infinitely scalable. Because if we can make a profit  we can do it for          a million      million  a billion. The solution becomes self sustaining. That's what business does when it makes a profit. Now what does this all have to do with social problems  Well  one line of thinking is  let's take this profit and redeploy it into social problems. Business should give more. Business should be more responsible. And that's been the path that we've been on in business. But again  this path that we've been on is not getting us where we need to go. Now  I started out as a strategy professor  and I'm still a strategy professor. I'm proud of that. But I've also  over the years  worked more and more on social issues. I've worked on healthcare  the environment  economic development  reducing poverty  and as I worked more and more in the social field  I started seeing something that had a profound impact on me and my whole life  in a way. The conventional wisdom in economics and the view in business has historically been that actually  there's a tradeoff between social performance and economic performance. The conventional wisdom has been that business actually makes a profit by causing a social problem. The classic example is pollution. If business pollutes  it makes more money than if it tried to reduce that pollution. Reducing pollution is expensive  therefore businesses don't want to do it. It's profitable to have an unsafe working environment. It's too expensive to have a safe working environment  therefore business makes more money if they don't have a safe working environment. That's been the conventional wisdom. A lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom. They resisted environmental improvement. They resisted workplace improvement. That thinking has led to  I think  much of the behavior that we have come to criticize in business  that I come to criticize in business. But the more deeply I got into all these social issues  one after another  and actually  the more I tried to address them myself  personally  in a few cases  through nonprofits that I was involved with  the more I found actually that the reality is the opposite. Business does not profit from causing social problems  actually not in any fundamental sense. That's a very simplistic view. The deeper we get into these issues  the more we start to understand that actually business profits from solving from social problems. That's where the real profit comes. Let's take pollution. We've learned today that actually reducing pollution and emissions is generating profit. It saves money. It makes the business more productive and efficient. It doesn't waste resources. Having a safer working environment actually  and avoiding accidents  it makes the business more profitable  because it's a sign of good processes. Accidents are expensive and costly. Issue by issue by issue  we start to learn that actually there's no trade off between social progress and economic efficiency in any fundamental sense. Another issue is health. I mean  what we've found is actually health of employees is something that business should treasure  because that health allows those employees to be more productive and come to work and not be absent. The deeper work  the new work  the new thinking on the interface between business and social problems is actually showing that there's a fundamental  deep synergy  particularly if you're not thinking in the very short run. In the very short run  you can sometimes fool yourself into thinking that there's fundamentally opposing goals  but in the long run  ultimately  we're learning in field after field that this is simply not true. So how could we tap into the power of business to address the fundamental problems that we face  Imagine if we could do that  because if we could do it  we could scale. We could tap into this enormous resource pool and this organizational capacity. And guess what  That's happening now  finally  partly because of people like you who have raised these issues now for year after year and decade after decade. We see organizations like Dow Chemical leading the revolution away from trans fat and saturated fat with innovative new products. This is an example of Jain Irrigation. This is a company that's brought drip irrigation technology to thousands and millions of farmers  reducing substantially the use of water. We see companies like the Brazilian forestry company Fibria that's figured out how to avoid tearing down old growth forest and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield per hectare of pulp and making much more paper than you could make by cutting down those old trees. You see companies like Cisco that are training so far four million people in I.T. skills to actually  yes  be responsible  but help expand the opportunity to disseminate I.T. technology and grow the whole business. There's a fundamental opportunity for business today to impact and address these social problems  and this opportunity is the largest business opportunity we see in business. And the question is  how can we get business thinking to adapt this issue of shared value  This is what I call shared value  addressing a social issue with a business model. That's shared value. Shared value is capitalism  but it's a higher kind of capitalism. It's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be  meeting important needs  not incrementally competing for trivial differences in product attributes and market share. Shared value is when we can create social value and economic value simultaneously. It's finding those opportunities that will unleash the greatest possibility we have to actually address these social problems because we can scale. We can address shared value at multiple levels. It's real. It's happening. But in order to get this solution working  we have to now change how business sees itself  and this is thankfully underway. Businesses got trapped into the conventional wisdom that they shouldn't worry about social problems  that this was sort of something on the side  that somebody else was doing it. We're now seeing companies embrace this idea. But we also have to recognize business is not going to do this as effectively as if we have NGOs and government working in partnership with business. The new NGOs that are really moving the needle are the ones that have found these partnerships  that have found these ways to collaborate. The governments that are making the most progress are the governments that have found ways to enable shared value in business rather than see government as the only player that has to call the shots. And government has many ways in which it could impact the willingness and the ability of companies to compete in this way. I think if we can get business seeing itself differently  and if we can get others seeing business differently  we can change the world. I know it. I'm seeing it. I'm feeling it. Young people  I think  my Harvard Business School students  are getting it. If we can break down this sort of divide  this unease  this tension  this sense that we're not fundamentally collaborating here in driving these social problems  we can break this down  and we finally  I think  can have solutions. Thank you. Here's a question we need to rethink together  What should be the role of money and markets in our societies  Today  there are very few things that money can't buy. If you're sentenced to a jail term in Santa Barbara  California  you should know that if you don't like the standard accommodations  you can buy a prison cell upgrade. It's true. For how much  do you think  What would you guess  Five hundred dollars  It's not the Ritz Carlton. It's a jail  Eighty two dollars a night. Eighty two dollars a night. If you go to an amusement park and don't want to stand in the long lines for the popular rides  there is now a solution. In many theme parks  you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line. They call them Fast Track or VIP tickets. And this isn't only happening in amusement parks. In Washington  D.C.  long lines  queues sometimes form for important Congressional hearings. Now some people don't like to wait in long queues  maybe overnight  even in the rain. So now  for lobbyists and others who are very keen to attend these hearings but don't like to wait  there are companies  line standing companies  and you can go to them. You can pay them a certain amount of money  they hire homeless people and others who need a job to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes  and the lobbyist  just before the hearing begins  can take his or her place at the head of the line and a seat in the front of the room. Paid line standing. It's happening  the recourse to market mechanisms and market thinking and market solutions  in bigger arenas. Take the way we fight our wars. Did you know that  in Iraq and Afghanistan  there were more private military contractors on the ground than there were U.S. military troops  Now this isn't because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to outsource war to private companies  but this is what has happened. Over the past three decades  we have lived through a quiet revolution. We've drifted almost without realizing it from having a market economy to becoming market societies. The difference is this  A market economy is a tool  a valuable and effective tool  for organizing productive activity  but a market society is a place where almost everything is up for sale. It's a way of life  in which market thinking and market values begin to dominate every aspect of life  personal relations  family life  health  education  politics  law  civic life. Now  why worry  Why worry about our becoming market societies  For two reasons  I think. One of them has to do with inequality. The more things money can buy  the more affluence  or the lack of it  matters. If the only thing that money determined was access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs  then inequality wouldn't matter very much. But when money comes increasingly to govern access to the essentials of the good life    decent health care  access to the best education  political voice and influence in campaigns    when money comes to govern all of those things  inequality matters a great deal. And so the marketization of everything sharpens the sting of inequality and its social and civic consequence. That's one reason to worry. There's a second reason apart from the worry about inequality  and it's this  with some social goods and practices  when market thinking and market values enter  they may change the meaning of those practices and crowd out attitudes and norms worth caring about. I'd like to take an example of a controversial use of a market mechanism  a cash incentive  and see what you think about it. Many schools struggle with the challenge of motivating kids  especially kids from disadvantaged backgrounds  to study hard  to do well in school  to apply themselves. Some economists have proposed a market solution  Offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades or high test scores or for reading books. They've tried this  actually. They've done some experiments in some major American cities. In New York  in Chicago  in Washington  D.C.  they've tried this  offering    dollars for an A     dollars for a B. In Dallas  Texas  they have a program that offers eight year olds two dollars for each book they read. So let's see what    Some people are in favor  some people are opposed to this cash incentive to motivate achievement. Let's see what people here think about it. Imagine that you are the head of a major school system  and someone comes to you with this proposal. And let's say it's a foundation. They will provide the funds. You don't have to take it out of your budget. How many would be in favor and how many would be opposed to giving it a try  Let's see by a show of hands. First  how many think it might at least be worth a try to see if it would work  Raise your hand. And how many would be opposed  How many would    So the majority here are opposed  but a sizable minority are in favor. Let's have a discussion. Let's start with those of you who object  who would rule it out even before trying. What would be your reason  Who will get our discussion started  Yes  Heike Moses  Hello everyone  I'm Heike  and I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation  so in the respect that children  if they would like to read  you just take this incentive away in just paying them  so it just changes behavior. Michael Sandel  Takes the intrinsic incentive away. What is  or should be  the intrinsic motivation  HM  Well  the intrinsic motivation should be to learn. MS  To learn. HM  To get to know the world. And then  if you stop paying them  what happens then  Then they stop reading  MS  Now  let's see if there's someone who favors  who thinks it's worth trying this. Elizabeth Loftus  I'm Elizabeth Loftus  and you said worth a try  so why not try it and do the experiment and measure things  MS  And measure. And what would you measure  You'd measure how many    EL  How many books they read and how many books they continued to read after you stopped paying them. MS  Oh  after you stopped paying. All right  what about that  HM  To be frank  I just think this is  not to offend anyone  a very American way. MS  All right. What's emerged from this discussion is the following question  Will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt or crowd out the higher motivation  the intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey  which is to learn to love to learn and to read for their own sakes  And people disagree about what the effect will be  but that seems to be the question  that somehow a market mechanism or a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson  and if it does  what will become of these children later  I should tell you what's happened with these experiments. The cash for good grades has had very mixed results  for the most part has not resulted in higher grades. The two dollars for each book did lead those kids to read more books. It also led them to read shorter books. But the real question is  what will become of these kids later  Will they have learned that reading is a chore  a form of piecework to be done for pay  that's the worry  or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake  Now  what this  even this brief debate  brings out is something that many economists overlook. Economists often assume that markets are inert  that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange. Market exchange  they assume  doesn't change the meaning or value of the goods being exchanged. This may be true enough if we're talking about material goods. If you sell me a flat screen television or give me one as a gift  it will be the same good. It will work the same either way. But the same may not be true if we're talking about nonmaterial goods and social practices such as teaching and learning or engaging together in civic life. In those domains  bringing market mechanisms and cash incentives may undermine or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes worth caring about. Once we see that markets and commerce  when extended beyond the material domain  can change the character of the goods themselves  can change the meaning of the social practices  as in the example of teaching and learning  we have to ask where markets belong and where they don't  where they may actually undermine values and attitudes worth caring about. But to have this debate  we have to do something we're not very good at  and that is to reason together in public about the value and the meaning of the social practices we prize  from our bodies to family life to personal relations to health to teaching and learning to civic life. Now these are controversial questions  and so we tend to shrink from them. In fact  during the past three decades  when market reasoning and market thinking have gathered force and gained prestige  our public discourse during this time has become hollowed out  empty of larger moral meaning. For fear of disagreement  we shrink from these questions. But once we see that markets change the character of goods  we have to debate among ourselves these bigger questions about how to value goods. One of the most corrosive effects of putting a price on everything is on commonality  the sense that we are all in it together. Against the background of rising inequality  marketizing every aspect of life leads to a condition where those who are affluent and those who are of modest means increasingly live separate lives. We live and work and shop and play in different places. Our children go to different schools. This isn't good for democracy  nor is it a satisfying way to live  even for those of us who can afford to buy our way to the head of the line. Here's why. Democracy does not require perfect equality  but what it does require is that citizens share in a common life. What matters is that people of different social backgrounds and different walks of life encounter one another  bump up against one another in the ordinary course of life  because this is what teaches us to negotiate and to abide our differences. And this is how we come to care for the common good. And so  in the end  the question of markets is not mainly an economic question. It's really a question of how we want to live together. Do we want a society where everything is up for sale  or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy  Thank you very much. The work of a transportation commissioner isn't just about stop signs and traffic signals. It involves the design of cities and the design of city streets. Streets are some of the most valuable resources that a city has  and yet it's an asset that's largely hidden in plain sight. And the lesson from New York over the past six years is that you can update this asset. You can remake your streets quickly  inexpensively  it can provide immediate benefits  and it can be quite popular. You just need to look at them a little differently. This is important because we live in an urban age. For the first time in history  most people live in cities  and the U.N. estimates that over the next    years  the population is going to double on the planet. So the design of cities is a key issue for our future. Mayor Bloomberg recognized this when he launched PlaNYC in     . The plan recognized that cities are in a global marketplace  and that if we're going to continue to grow and thrive and to attract the million more people that are expected to move here  we need to focus on the quality of life and the efficiency of our infrastructure. For many cities  our streets have been in a kind of suspended animation for generations. This is a picture of Times Square in the '  s  and despite all of the technological innovation  cultural changes  political changes  this is Times Square in     . Not much has changed in those    years. So we worked hard to refocus our agenda  to maximize efficient mobility  providing more room for buses  more room for bikes  more room for people to enjoy the city  and to make our streets as safe as they can be for everybody that uses them. We set out a clear action plan with goals and benchmarks. Having goals is important  because if you want to change and steer the ship of a big city in a new direction  you need to know where you're going and why. The design of a street can tell you everything about what's expected on it. In this case  it's expected that you shelter in place. The design of this street is really to maximize the movement of cars moving as quickly as possible from point A to point B  and it misses all the other ways that a street is used. When we started out  we did some early surveys about how our streets were used  and we found that New York City was largely a city without seats. Pictures like this  people perched on a fire hydrant  not the mark of a world class city. It's not great for parents with kids. It's not great for seniors. It's not great for retailers. It's probably not good for the fire hydrants. Certainly not good for the police department. So we worked hard to change that balance  and probably the best example of our new approach is in Times Square. Three hundred and fifty thousand people a day walk through Times Square  and people had tried for years to make changes. They changed signals  they changed lanes  everything they could do to make Times Square work better. It was dangerous  hard to cross the street. It was chaotic. And so  none of those approaches worked  so we took a different approach  a bigger approach  looked at our street differently. And so we did a six month pilot. We closed Broadway from   nd Street to   th Street and created two and a half acres of new pedestrian space. And the temporary materials are an important part of the program  because we were able to show how it worked. And I work for a data driven mayor  as you probably know. So it was all about the data. So if it worked better for traffic  if it was better for mobility  if it was safer  better for business  we would keep it  and if it didn't work  no harm  no foul  we could put it back the way that it was  because these were temporary materials. And that was a very big part of the buy in  much less anxiety when you think that something can be put back. But the results were overwhelming. Traffic moved better. It was much safer. Five new flagship stores opened. It's been a total home run. Times Square is now one of the top    retail locations on the planet. And this is an important lesson  because it doesn't need to be a zero sum game between moving traffic and creating public space. Every project has its surprises  and one of the big surprises with Times Square was how quickly people flocked to the space. We put out the orange barrels  and people just materialized immediately into the street. It was like a Star Trek episode  you know  They weren't there before  and then zzzzzt  All the people arrived. Where they'd been  I don't know  but they were there. And this actually posed an immediate challenge for us  because the street furniture had not yet arrived. So we went to a hardware store and bought hundreds of lawn chairs  and we put those lawn chairs out on the street. And the lawn chairs became the talk of the town. It wasn't about that we'd closed Broadway to cars. It was about those lawn chairs.  What did you think about the lawn chairs    Do you like the color of the lawn chairs   So if you've got a big  controversial project  think about lawn chairs. This is the final design for Times Square  and it will create a level surface  sidewalk to sidewalk  beautiful pavers that have studs in them to reflect the light from the billboards  creating a great new energy on the street  and we think it's going to really create a great place  a new crossroads of the world that is worthy of its name. And we will be cutting the ribbon on this  the first phase  this December. With all of our projects  our public space projects  we work closely with local businesses and local merchant groups who maintain the spaces  move the furniture  take care of the plants. This is in front of Macy's  and they were a big supporter of this new approach  because they understood that more people on foot is better for business. And we've done these projects all across the city in all kinds of neighborhoods. This is in Bed Stuy  Brooklyn  and you can see the short leg that was there  used for cars  that's not really needed. So what we did is we painted over the street  put down epoxy gravel  and connected the triangle to the storefronts on Grand Avenue  created a great new public space  and it's been great for businesses along Grand Avenue. We did the same thing in DUMBO  in Brooklyn  and this is one of our first projects that we did  and we took an underutilized  pretty dingy looking parking lot and used some paint and planters to transform it over a weekend. And in the three years since we've implemented the project  retail sales have increased     percent. And that's twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood. We've moved very  very quickly with paint and temporary materials. Instead of waiting through years of planning studies and computer models to get something done  we've done it with paint and temporary materials. And the proof is not in a computer model. It is in the real world performance of the street. You can have fun with paint. All told  we've created over    pedestrian plazas in all five boroughs across the city. We've repurposed    acres of active car lanes and turned them into new pedestrian space. I think one of the successes is in its emulation. You're seeing this kind of approach  since we've painted Times Square  you've seen this approach in Boston  in Chicago  in San Francisco  in Mexico City  Buenos Aires  you name it. This is actually in Los Angeles  and they actually copied even the green dots that we had on the streets. But I can't underscore enough how much more quickly this enables you to move over traditional construction methods. We also brought this quick acting approach to our cycling program  and in six years turned cycling into a real transportation option in New York. I think it's fair to say    it used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike  and now New York has become one of the cycling capitals in the United States. And we moved quickly to create an interconnected network of lanes. You can see the map in     . This is how it looked in      after we built out     miles of on street bike lanes. I love this because it looks so easy. You just click it  and they're there. We also brought new designs to the street. We created the first parking protected bike lane in the United States. We protected bikers by floating parking lanes  and it's been great. Bike volumes have spiked. Injuries to all users  pedestrians  cyclists  drivers  are all down    percent. And we've built    miles of these protected bike lanes  and now you're seeing them pop up all over the country. And you can see here that this strategy has worked. The blue line is the number of cyclists  soaring. The green line is the number of bike lanes. And the yellow line is the number of injuries  which has remained essentially flat. After this big expansion  you've seen no net increase in injuries  and so there is something to that axiom that there is safety in numbers. Not everybody liked the new bike lanes  and there was a lawsuit and somewhat of a media frenzy a couple years ago. One Brooklyn paper called this bike lane that we have on Prospect Park West  the most contested piece of land outside of the Gaza Strip.  And this is what we had done. So if you dig below the headlines  though  you'll see that the people were far ahead of the press  far ahead of the politicians. In fact  I think most politicians would be happy to have those kind of poll numbers. Sixty four percent of New Yorkers support these bike lanes. This summer  we launched Citi Bike  the largest bike share program in the United States  with       bikes and     stations located next to one another. Since we've launched the program  three million trips have been taken. People have ridden seven million miles. That's     times around the globe. And so with this little blue key  you can unlock the keys to the city and this brand new transportation option. And daily usage just continues to soar. What has happened is the average daily ridership on the streets of New York is        people. The high that we've had so far is        in August. Yesterday         people used Citi Bike in New York City. The bikes are being used six times a day. And I think you also see it in the kinds of riders that are on the streets. In the past  it looked like the guy on the left  ninja clad bike messenger. And today  cyclists look like New York City looks. It's diverse    young  old  black  white  women  kids  all getting on a bike. It's an affordable  safe  convenient way to get around. Quite radical. We've also brought this approach to our buses  and New York City has the largest bus fleet in North America  the slowest bus speeds. As everybody knows  you can walk across town faster than you can take the bus. And so we focused on the most congested areas of New York City  built out six bus rapid transit lines     miles of new speedy bus lanes. You pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus. We've got dedicated lanes that keep cars out because they get ticketed by a camera if they use that lane  and it's been a huge success. I think one of my very favorite moments as transportation commissioner was the day that we launched Citi Bike  and I was riding Citi Bike up First Avenue in my protected bike lane  and I looked over and I saw pedestrians standing safely on the pedestrian islands  and the traffic was flowing  birds were singing    the buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes. It was just fantastic. And this is how it looked six years ago. And so  I think that the lesson that we have from New York is that it's possible to change your streets quickly  it's not expensive  it can provide immediate benefits  and it can be quite popular. You just need to reimagine your streets. They're hidden in plain sight. Thank you.  Iran is Israel's best friend  and we do not intend to change our position in relation to Tehran.  Believe it or not  this is a quote from an Israeli prime minister  but it's not Ben Gurion or Golda Meir from the era of the Shah. It's actually from Yitzhak Rabin. The year is     . Ayatollah Khomeini is still alive  and much like Ahmadinejad today  he's using the worst rhetoric against Israel. Yet  Rabin referred to Iran as a geostrategic friend. Today  when we hear the threats of war and the high rhetoric  we're oftentimes led to believe that this is yet another one of those unsolvable Middle Eastern conflicts with roots as old as the region itself. Nothing could be further from the truth  and I hope today to show you why that is. The relations between the Iranian and the Jewish people throughout history has actually been quite positive  starting in     B.C.  when King Cyrus the Great of Persia liberated the Jewish people from their Babylonian captivity. A third of the Jewish population stayed in Babylonia. They're today's Iraqi Jews. A third migrated to Persia. They're today's Iranian Jews  still        of them living in Iran  making them the largest Jewish community in the Middle East outside of Israel itself. And a third returned to historic Palestine  did the second rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem  financed  incidentally  by Persian tax money. But even in modern times  relations have been close at times. Rabin's statement was a reflection of decades of security and intelligence collaboration between the two  which in turn was born out of perception of common threats. Both states feared the Soviet Union and strong Arab states such as Egypt and Iraq. And  in addition  the Israeli doctrine of the periphery  the idea that Israel's security was best achieved by creating alliances with the non Arab states in the periphery of the region in order to balance the Arab states in its vicinity. Now  from the Shah's perspective  though  he wanted to keep this as secret as possible  so when Yitzhak Rabin  for instance  traveled to Iran in the '  s  he usually wore a wig so that no one would recognize him. The Iranians built a special tarmac at the airport in Tehran  far away from the central terminal  so that no one would notice the large number of Israeli planes shuttling between Tel Aviv and Tehran. Now  did all of this end with the Islamic revolution in       In spite of the very clear anti Israeli ideology of the new regime  the geopolitical logic for their collaboration lived on  because they still had common threats. And when Iraq invaded Iran in       Israel feared an Iraqi victory and actively helped Iran by selling it arms and providing it with spare parts for Iran's American weaponry at a moment when Iran was very vulnerable because of an American arms embargo that Israel was more than happy to violate. In fact  back in the     s  it was Israel that lobbied Washington to talk to Iran  to sell arms to Iran  and not pay attention to Iran's anti Israeli ideology. And this  of course  climaxed in the Iran Contra scandal of the     s. But with the end of the Cold War came also the end of the Israeli Iranian cold peace. Suddenly  the two common threats that had pushed them closer together throughout decades  more or less evaporated. The Soviet Union collapsed  Iraq was defeated  and a new environment was created in the region in which both of them felt more secure  but they were also now left unchecked. Without Iraq balancing Iran  Iran could now become a threat  some in Israel argued. In fact  the current dynamic that you see between Iran and Israel has its roots more so in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region after the Cold War than in the events of       because at this point  Iran and Israel emerge as two of the most powerful states in the region  and rather than viewing each other as potential security partners  they increasingly came to view each other as rivals and competitors. So Israel  who in the     s lobbied for and improved U.S. Iran relations now feared a U.S. Iran rapprochement  thinking that it would come at Israel's security interests' expense  and instead sought to put Iran in increased isolation. Ironically  this was happening at a time when Iran was more interested in peacemaking with Washington than to see to Israel's destruction. Iran had put itself in isolation because of its radicalism  and after having helped the United States indirectly in the war against Iraq in       the Iranians were hoping that they would be rewarded by being included in the post war security architecture of the region. But Washington chose to ignore Iran's outreach  as it would a decade later in Afghanistan  and instead moved to intensify Iran's isolation  and it is at this point  around       '    that Iran begins to translate its anti Israeli ideology into operational policy. The Iranians believed that whatever they did  even if they moderated their policies  the U.S. would continue to seek Iran's isolation  and the only way Iran could compel Washington to change its position was by imposing a cost on the U.S. if it didn't. The easiest target was the peace process  and now the Iranian ideological bark was to be accompanied by a nonconventional bite  and Iran began supporting extensively Palestinian Islamist groups that it previously had shunned. In some ways  this sounds paradoxical  but according to Martin Indyk of the Clinton administration  the Iranians had not gotten it entirely wrong  because the more peace there would be between Israel and Palestine  the U.S. believed  the more Iran would get isolated. The more Iran got isolated  the more peace there would be. So according to Indyk  and these are his words  the Iranians had an interest to do us in on the peace process in order to defeat our policy of containment. To defeat our policy of containment  not about ideology. But throughout even the worst times of their entanglement  all sides have reached out to each other. Netanyahu  when he got elected in       reached out to the Iranians to see if there were any ways that the doctrine of the periphery could be resurrected. Tehran was not interested. A few years later  the Iranians sent a comprehensive negotiation proposal to the Bush administration  a proposal that revealed that there was some potential of getting Iran and Israel back on terms again. The Bush administration did not even respond. All sides have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. But this is not an ancient conflict. This is not even an ideological conflict. The ebbs and flows of hostility have not shifted with ideological zeal  but rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape. When Iran and Israel's security imperatives dictated collaboration  they did so in spite of lethal ideological opposition to each other. When Iran's ideological impulses collided with its strategic interests  the strategic interests always prevailed. This is good news  because it means that neither war nor enmity is a foregone conclusion. But some want war. Some believe or say that it's       Iran is Germany  and Ahmadinejad is Hitler. If we accept this to be true  that indeed it is       Iran is Germany  Ahmadinejad is Hitler  then the question we have to ask ourself is  who wishes to play the role of Neville Chamberlain  Who will risk peace  This is an analogy that is deliberately aimed at eliminating diplomacy  and when you eliminate diplomacy  you make war inevitable. In an ideological conflict  there can be no truce  no draw  no compromise  only victory or defeat. But rather than making war inevitable by viewing this as ideological  we would be wise to seek ways to make peace possible. Iran and Israel's conflict is a new phenomenon  only a few decades old in a history of       years  and precisely because its roots are geopolitical  it means that solutions can be found  compromises can be struck  however difficult it yet may be. After all  it was Yitzhak Rabin himself who said   You don't make peace with your friends. You make it with your enemies.  Thank you. I'm a physician trained in infectious diseases  and following my training  I moved to Somalia from San Francisco. And my goodbye greeting from the chief of infectious diseases at San Francisco General was   Gary  this is the biggest mistake you'll ever make.  But I landed in a refugee situation that had a million refugees in    camps  and there were six of us doctors. There were many epidemics there. My responsibilities were largely related to tuberculosis  and then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera. So it was the spread of tuberculosis and the spread of cholera that I was responsible for inhibiting. And in order to do this work  we  of course  because of the limitation in health workers  had to recruit refugees to be a specialized new category of health worker. Following three years of work in Somalia  I got picked up by the World Health Organization  and got assigned to the epidemics of AIDS. My primary responsibility was Uganda  but also I worked in Rwanda and Burundi and Zaire  now Congo  Tanzania  Malawi  and several other countries. And my last assignment there was to run a unit called intervention development  which was responsible for designing interventions. After    years of working overseas  I was exhausted. I really had very little left. I had been traveling to one country after another. I was emotionally feeling very isolated. I wanted to come home. I'd seen a lot of death  in particular epidemic death  and epidemic death has a different feel to it. It's full of panic and fear  and I'd heard the women wailing and crying in the desert. And I wanted to come home and take a break and maybe start over. I was not aware of any epidemic problems in America. In fact  I wasn't aware of any problems in America. In fact    seriously. And in fact I would visit friends of mine  and I noticed that they had water that came right into their homes. How many of you have such a situation  And some of them  many of them actually  had water that came into more than one room. And I noticed that they would move this little thermoregulatory device to change the temperature in their home by one degree or two degrees. And now I do that. And I really didn't know what I would do  but friends of mine began telling me about children shooting other children with guns. And I asked the question  what are you doing about it  What are you in America doing about it  And there were two essential explanations or ideas that were prevalent. And one was punishment. And this I had heard about before. We who had worked in behavior knew that punishment was something that was discussed but also that it was highly overvalued. It was not a main driver of behavior  nor was it a main driver of behavior change. And besides that  it reminded me of ancient epidemics that were previously completely misunderstood because the science hadn't been there before  epidemics of plague or typhus or leprosy  where the prevalent ideas were that there were bad people or bad humors or bad air  and widows were dragged around the moat  and dungeons were part of the solution. The other explanation or  in a way  the solution suggested  is please fix all of these things  the schools  the community  the homes  the families  everything. And I'd heard this before as well. I'd called this the  everything  theory  or EOE  Everything On Earth. But we'd also realized in treating other processes and problems that sometimes you don't need to treat everything. And so the sense that I had was there was a giant gap here. The problem of violence was stuck  and this has historically been the case in many other issues. Diarrheal diseases had been stuck. Malaria had been stuck. Frequently  a strategy has to be rethought. It's not as if I had any idea what it would look like  but there was a sense that we would have to do something with new categories of workers and something having to do with behavior change and something having to do with public education. But I began to ask questions and search out the usual things that I had been exploring before  like  what do the maps look like  What do the graphs look like  What does the data look like  And the maps of violence in most U.S. cities looked like this. There was clustering. This reminded me of clustering that we'd seen also in infectious epidemics  for example cholera. And then we looked at the maps  and the maps showed this typical wave upon wave upon wave  because all epidemics are combinations of many epidemics. And it also looked like infectious epidemics. And then we asked the question  well what really predicts a case of violence  And it turns out that the greatest predictor of a case of violence is a preceding case of violence. Which also sounds like  if there is a case of flu  someone gave someone a case of flu  or a cold  or the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis is having been exposed to tuberculosis. And so we see that violence is  in a way  behaving like a contagious disease. We're aware of this anyway even in our common experiences or our newspaper stories of the spread of violence from fights or in gang wars or in civil wars or even in genocides. And so there's good news about this  though  because there's a way to reverse epidemics  and there's really only three things that are done to reverse epidemics  and the first of it is interrupting transmission. In order to interrupt transmission  you need to detect and find first cases. In other words  for T.B. you have to find somebody who has active T.B. who is infecting other people. Make sense  And there's special workers for doing that. For this particular problem  we designed a new category of worker who  like a SARS worker or someone looking for bird flu  might find first cases. In this case  it's someone who's very angry because someone looked at his girlfriend or owes him money  and you can find workers and train them into these specialized categories. And the second thing to do  of course  is to prevent further spread  that means to find who else has been exposed  but may not be spreading so much right now like someone with a smaller case of T.B.  or someone who is just hanging out in the neighborhoods  but in the same group  and then they need to be  in a way  managed as well  particular to the specific disease process. And then the third part  the shifting the norms  and that means a whole bunch of community activities  remodeling  public education  and then you've got what you might call group immunity. And that combination of factors is how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda was very successfully reversed. And so what we decided to do in the year      is kind of put this together in a way by hiring in new categories of workers  the first being violence interruptors. And then we would put all of this into place in one neighborhood in what was the worst police district in the United States at the time. So violence interruptors hired from the same group  credibility  trust  access  just like the health workers in Somalia  but designed for a different category  and trained in persuasion  cooling people down  buying time  reframing. And then another category of worker  the outreach workers  to keep people in a way on therapy for six to    months. Just like T.B.  but the object is behavior change. And then a bunch of community activities for changing norms. Now our first experiment of this resulted in a    percent drop in shootings and killings in the West Garfield neighborhood of Chicago. And this was a beautiful thing for the neighborhood itself  first    or    days  then    days  and then there was unfortunately another shooting in another    days  and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon. They were using parks they weren't using before. The sun was out. Everybody was happy. But of course  the funders said   Wait a second  do it again.  And so we had to then  fortunately  get the funds to repeat this experience  and this is one of the next four neighborhoods that had a    percent drop in shootings and killings. And since that time  this has been replicated    times. There have been independent evaluations supported by the Justice Department and by the CDC and performed by Johns Hopkins that have shown    to    percent and    to    percent reductions in shootings and killings using this new method. In fact  there have been three independent evaluations of this now. Now we've gotten a lot of attention as a result of this  including being featured on The New York Times' Sunday magazine cover story. The Economist in      said this is  the approach that will come to prominence.  And even a movie was made around our work.  The Interrupters  However  not so fast  because a lot of people did not agree with this way of going about it. We got a lot of criticism  a lot of opposition  and a lot of opponents. In other words  what do you mean  health problem  What do you mean  epidemic  What do you mean  no bad guys  And there's whole industries designed for managing bad people. What do you mean  hiring people who have backgrounds  My business friends said   Gary  you're being criticized tremendously. You must be doing something right.  My musician friends added the word  dude.  So anyway  additionally  there was still this problem  and we were getting highly criticized as well for not dealing with all of these other problems. Yet we were able to manage malaria and reduce HIV and reduce diarrheal diseases in places with awful economies without healing the economy. So what's actually happened is  although there is still some opposition  the movement is clearly growing. Many of the major cities in the U.S.  including New York City and Baltimore and Kansas City  their health departments are running this now. Chicago and New Orleans  the health departments are having a very large role in this. This is being embraced more by law enforcement than it had been years ago. Trauma centers and hospitals are doing their part in stepping up. And the U.S. Conference of Mayors has endorsed not only the approach but the specific model. Where there's really been uptake even faster is in the international environment  where there's a    percent drop in the first neighborhood in Puerto Rico  where interruptions are just beginning in Honduras  where the strategy has been applied in Kenya for the recent elections  and where there have been     interruptions in Iraq. So violence is responding as a disease even as it behaves as a disease. So the theory  in a way  is kind of being validated by the treatment. And recently  the Institute of Medicine came out with a workshop report which went through some of the data  including the neuroscience  on how this problem is really transmitted. So I think this is good news  because it allows us an opportunity to come out of the Middle Ages  which is where I feel this field has been. It gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility of replacing some of these prisons with playgrounds or parks  and to consider the possibility of converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods  and to allow there to be a new strategy  a new set of methods  a new set of workers  science  in a way  replacing morality. And moving away from emotions is the most important part of the solution to science as a more important part of the solution. So I didn't mean to come up with this at all. It was a matter of  I wanted actually a break  and we looked at maps  we looked at graphs  we asked some questions and tried some tools that actually have been used many times before for other things. For myself  I tried to get away from infectious diseases  and I didn't. Thank you. So in my free time outside of Twitter I experiment a little bit with telling stories online  experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools. And in my job at Twitter  I actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well  helping to expand out the bounds of what people are experimenting with. And I want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that I think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction. But I want to start and go back to the     s. Long before a little thing called Twitter  radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast. And from those single points emanated stories. Some of them were familiar stories. Some of them were new stories. And for a while they were familiar formats  but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium. Think about episodes that happened live on radio. Combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction  you get this new format. And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories. And of course  today  we have an entirely new medium to play with  which is this online world. This is the map of verified users on Twitter and the connections between them. There are thousands upon thousands of them. Every single one of these points is its own broadcaster. We've gone to this world of many to many  where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting. And I think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium. I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation  if you will  that we've explored and begun to settle this wild land of the Internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it  and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create. I believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods. The short story  for example  people are saying that the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e readers  digital marketplaces. One writer  Hugh Howey  experimented with short stories on Amazon by releasing one very short story called  Wool.  And he actually says that he didn't intend for  Wool  to become a series  but that the audience loved the first story so much they demanded more  and so he gave them more. He gave them  Wool     which was a little bit longer than the first one   Wool     which was even longer  culminating in  Wool     which was a        word novel. I think Howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e books. He was able to write and publish in relatively short order. There was no mediator between him and the audience. It was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him. So this whole project was an experiment. It started with the one short story  and I think the experimentation actually became a part of Howey's format. And that's something that this medium enabled  was experimentation being a part of the format itself. This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan called  Black Box.  It was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind. Egan convinced The New Yorker to start a New Yorker fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created. Now Twitter  of course  has a     character limit. Egan mocked that up just writing manually in this storyboard sketchbook  used the physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet  and those tweets ended up becoming over     of them that were serialized by The New Yorker. Every night  at   p.m.  you could tune in to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account. I think that's pretty exciting  tune in literary fiction. The experience of Egan's story  of course  like anything on Twitter  there were multiple ways to experience it. You could scroll back through it  but interestingly  if you were watching it live  there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets  you had no control over when you would read them. They were coming at a pretty regular clip  but as the story was building  normally  as a reader  you control how fast you move through a text  but in this case  The New Yorker did  and they were sending you bit by bit by bit  and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line. Another great example of fiction and the short story on Twitter  Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called  Evidence.  It began with this tweet   On November    at       p.m.  a woman identified as Miranda Brown      of Brooklyn  fell to her death from the roof of a Manhattan hotel.  It begins in Elliott's voice  but then Elliott's voice recedes  and we hear the voices of Elsa  Margot and Simon  characters that Elliott created on Twitter specifically to tell this story  a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at       p.m. when this woman falls to her death. These three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives. One reviewer called Elliott's story  Twitter fiction done right   because she did. She captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time. Interestingly  though  it wasn't just Twitter as a distribution mechanism. It was also Twitter as a production mechanism. Elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs. She laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line  line by line. I think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters' voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves  but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter. As you begin to play with flexible identity online  it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world. Things like Invisible Obama or the famous  binders full of women  that came up during the      election cycle  or even the fan fiction universe of  West Wing  Twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in  The West Wing   including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window in one single episode.  Laughter  All of these are rapid iterations on a theme. They are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium. You look at something like  West Wing  Twitter  in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world. They comment on politics  they cry out against the evils of Congress. Keep in mind  they're all Democrats. And they engage with the real world. They respond to it. So once you take flexible identity  anonymity  engagement with the real world  and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story  that's when things get really interesting. So during the Chicago mayoral election there was a parody account. It was Mayor Emanuel. It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel  particularly in the expletive department. This foul mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race  providing commentary as it went. It followed all of the natural tropes of a good  solid Twitter parody account  but then started to get weird. And as it progressed  it moved from this commentary to a multi week  real time science fiction epic in which your protagonist  Rahm Emanuel  engages in multi dimensional travel on election day  which is    it didn't actually happen. I double checked the newspapers. And then  very interestingly  it came to an end. This is something that doesn't usually happen with a Twitter parody account. It ended  a true narrative conclusion. And so the author  Dan Sinker  who was a journalist  who was completely anonymous this whole time  I think Dan    it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book  because it was a narrative format in the end  and I think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats. One of my favorite examples of something that's happening on Twitter right now  actually  is the very absurdist Crimer Show. Crimer Show tells the story of a supercriminal and a hapless detective that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo  with all of the tropes of a television show. Crimer Show's creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K.  but  man  is it weird. And there are all these times where Crimer  the supercriminal  does all of these TV things. He's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera  but these things just happen in text. I think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each Crimer Show as an episode  spelled E P P A S O D   eppasod   presenting them as episodes really  it creates something new. There is a new  eppasod  of Crimer Show on Twitter pretty much every day  and they're archived that way. And I think this is an interesting experiment in format. Something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television. I think in nonfiction real time storytelling  there are a lot of really excellent examples as well. RealTimeWWII is an account that documents what was happening on this day    years ago in exceptional detail  as if you were reading the news reports from that day. And the author Teju Cole has done a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist on events of the news. In this particular case  he's talking about drone strikes. I think that in both of these examples  you're beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content that can be built into new types of fictional storytelling. So with real time storytelling  blurring the lines between fact and fiction  the real world and the digital world  flexible identity  anonymity  these are all tools that we have accessible to us  and I think that they're just the building blocks. They are the bits that we use to create the structures  the frames  that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation. Thank you. So I'm a city planner  an urban designer  former arts advocate  trained in architecture and art history  and I want to talk to you today not about design but about America and how America can be more economically resilient  how America can be healthier  and how America can be more environmentally sustainable. And I realize this is a global forum  but I think I need to talk about America because there is a history  in some places  not all  of American ideas being appropriated  being emulated  for better or for worse  around the world. And the worst idea we've ever had is suburban sprawl. It's being emulated in many places as we speak. By suburban sprawl  I refer to the reorganization of the landscape and the creation of the landscape around the requirement of automobile use  and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom has become a gas belching  time wasting and life threatening prosthetic device that many of us need just to  most Americans  in fact  need  just to live their daily lives. And there's an alternative. You know  we say  half the world is living in cities. Well  in America  that living in cities  for many of them  they're living in cities still where they're dependent on that automobile. And what I work for  and to do  is to make our cities more walkable. But I can't give design arguments for that that will have as much impact as the arguments that I've learned from the economists  the epidemiologists and the environmentalists. So these are the three arguments that I'm going to give you quickly today. When I was growing up in the '  s  the typical American spent one tenth of their income  American family  on transportation. Since then  we've doubled the number of roads in America  and we now spend one fifth of our income on transportation. Working families  which are defined as earning between        and        dollars a year in America are spending more now on transportation than on housing  slightly more  because of this phenomenon called  drive till you qualify   finding homes further and further and further from the city centers and from their jobs  so that they're locked in this  two  three hours  four hours a day of commuting. And these are the neighborhoods  for example  in the Central Valley of California that weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst and when the price of gas went up  they were decimated. And in fact  these are many of the half vacant communities that you see today. Imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage  it goes underwater  and you have to pay twice as much for all the driving that you're doing. So we know what it's done to our society and all the extra work we have to do to support our cars. What happens when a city decides it's going to set other priorities  And probably the best example we have here in America is Portland  Oregon. Portland made a bunch of decisions in the     s that began to distinguish it from almost every other American city. While most other cities were growing an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl  they instituted an urban growth boundary. While most cities were reaming out their roads  removing parallel parking and trees in order to flow more traffic  they instituted a skinny streets program. And while most cities were investing in more roads and more highways  they actually invested in bicycling and in walking. And they spent    million dollars on bike facilities  which seems like a lot of money  but it was spent over about    years  so two million dollars a year    not that much    and half the price of the one cloverleaf that they decided to rebuild in that city. These changes and others like them changed the way that Portlanders live  and their vehicle miles traveled per day  the amount that each person drives  actually peaked in       has been dropping ever since  and they now drive    percent less than the rest of the country. The typical Portland citizen drives four miles less  and    minutes less per day than they did before. The economist Joe Cortright did the math and he found out that those four miles plus those    minutes adds up to fully three and a half percent of all income earned in the region. So if they're not spending that money on driving    and by the way     percent of the money we spend on driving leaves the local economy    if they're not spending that money on driving  what are they spending it on  Well  Portland is reputed to have the most roof racks per capita  the most independent bookstores per capita  the most strip clubs per capita. These are all exaggerations  slight exaggerations of a fundamental truth  which is Portlanders spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds than the rest of America. Actually  Oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states  which may be a good thing or a bad thing  but it makes you glad they're driving less. But actually  they're spending most of it in their homes  and home investment is about as local an investment as you can get. But there's a whole other Portland story  which isn't part of this calculus  which is that young  educated people have been moving to Portland in droves  so that between the last two censuses  they had a    percent increase in college educated millennials  which is five times what you saw anywhere else in the country  or  I should say  of the national average. So on the one hand  a city saves money for its residents by being more walkable and more bikeable  but on the other hand  it also is the cool kind of city that people want to be in these days. So the best economic strategy you can have as a city is not the old way of trying to attract corporations and trying to have a biotech cluster or a medical cluster  or an aerospace cluster  but to become a place where people want to be. And millennials  certainly  these engines of entrepreneurship     percent of whom decide first where they want to live  then they move there  then they look for a job  they will come to your city. The health argument is a scary one  and you've probably heard part of this argument before. Again  back in the '  s  a lot's changed since then  back in the '  s  one in    Americans was obese. Now one out of three Americans is obese  and a second third of the population is overweight. Twenty five percent of young men and    percent of young women are too heavy to enlist in our own military forces. According to the Center for Disease Control  fully one third of all children born after      will get diabetes. We have the first generation of children in America who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents. I believe that this American healthcare crisis that we've all heard about is an urban design crisis  and that the design of our cities lies at the cure. Because we've talked a long time about diet  and we know that diet impacts weight  and weight of course impacts health. But we've only started talking about inactivity  and how inactivity born of our landscape  inactivity that comes from the fact that we live in a place where there is no longer any such thing as a useful walk  is driving our weight up. And we finally have the studies  one in Britain called  Gluttony versus sloth  that tracked weight against diet and tracked weight against inactivity  and found a much higher  stronger correlation between the latter two. Dr. James Levine at  in this case  the aptly named Mayo Clinic put his test subjects in electronic underwear  held their diet steady  and then started pumping the calories in. Some people gained weight  some people didn't gain weight. Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work  they were shocked to learn that the only difference between the subjects that they could figure out was the amount they were moving  and that in fact those who gained weight were sitting  on average  two hours more per day than those who didn't. So we have these studies that tie weight to inactivity  but even more  we now have studies that tie weight to where you live. Do you live in a more walkable city or do you live in a less walkable city  or where in your city do you live  In San Diego  they used Walk Score    Walk Score rates every address in America and soon the world in terms of how walkable it is    they used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods and less walkable neighborhoods. Well guess what  If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood  you were    percent likely to be overweight. If you lived in a less walkable neighborhood  you were    percent likely to be overweight. So we have study after study now that's tying where you live to your health  particularly as in America  the biggest health crisis we have is this one that's stemming from environmental induced inactivity. And I learned a new word last week. They call these neighborhoods  obesageneric.  I may have that wrong  but you get the idea. Now that's one thing  of course. Briefly mentioning  we have an asthma epidemic in this country. You probably haven't thought that much about it. Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma  three times what it was in the '  s  and it's almost all coming from car exhaust. American pollution does not come from factories anymore  it comes from tailpipes  and the amount that people are driving in your city  your urban VMT  is a good prediction of the asthma problems in your city. And then finally  in terms of driving  there's the issue of the single largest killer of healthy adults  and one of the largest killers of all people  is car crashes. And we take car crashes for granted. We figure it's a natural risk of being on the road. But in fact  here in America     people out of every         die every year from car crashes. We're pretty safe here. Well  guess what  In England  it's seven per        . It's Japan  it's four per        . Do you know where it's three per          New York City. San Francisco  the same thing. Portland  the same thing. Oh  so cities make us safer because we're driving less  Tulsa     per        . Orlando     per        . It's not whether you're in the city or not  it's how is your city designed  Was it designed around cars or around people  Because if your city is designed around cars  it's really good at smashing them into each other. That's part of a much larger health argument. Finally  the environmental argument is fascinating  because the environmentalists turned on a dime about    years ago. The environmental movement in America has historically been an anti city movement from Jefferson on.  Cities are pestilential to the health  to the liberties  to the morals of man. If we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities  as they do in Europe  we shall become as corrupt as they are in Europe and take to eating one another as they do there.  He apparently had a sense of humor. And then the American environmental movement has been a classically Arcadian movement. To become more environmental  we move into the country  we commune with nature  we build suburbs. But  of course  we've seen what that does. The carbon mapping of America  where is the CO  being emitted  for many years only hammered this argument in more strongly. If you look at any carbon map  because we map it per square mile  any carbon map of the U.S.  it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.  hottest in the cities  cooler in the suburbs  dark  peaceful in the countryside. Until some economists said  you know  is that the right way to measure CO   There are only so many people in this country at any given time  and we can choose to live where perhaps we would have a lighter impact. And they said  let's measure CO  per household  and when they did that  the maps just flipped  coolest in the center city  warmer in the suburbs  and red hot in these exurban  drive till you qualify  neighborhoods. So a fundamental shift  and now you have environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser saying we are a destructive species. If you love nature  the best thing you can do is stay the heck away from it  move to a city  and the denser the better  and the denser cities like Manhattan are the cities that perform the best. So the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline at the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '  s  consuming half of the electricity of Dallas. But of course  we can do better. Canadian cities  they consume half the gasoline of American cities. European cities consume half as much again. So obviously  we can do better  and we want to do better  and we're all trying to be green. My final argument in this topic is that I think we're trying to be green the wrong way  and I'm one of many people who believes that this focus on gadgets  on accessorizing    What can I add to my house  what can I add to what I've already got to make my lifestyle more sustainable     has kind of dominated the discussion. So I'm not immune to this. My wife and I built a new house on an abandoned lot in Washington  D.C.  and we did our best to clear the shelves of the sustainability store. We've got the solar photovoltaic system  solar hot water heater  dual flush toilets  bamboo floors. A log burning in my German high tech stove apparently  supposedly  contributes less carbon to the atmosphere than were it left alone to decompose in the forest. Yet all of these innovations    That's what they said in the brochure. All of these innovations together contribute a fraction of what we contribute by living in a walkable neighborhood three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city. We've changed all our light bulbs to energy savers  and you should do the same thing  but changing all your light bulbs to energy savers saves as much energy in a year as moving to a walkable city does in a week. And we don't want to have this argument. Politicians and marketers are afraid of marketing green as a  lifestyle choice.  You don't want to tell Americans  God forbid  that they have to change their lifestyle. But what if lifestyle was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more  something that would be better than what we have right now  Well  the gold standard of quality of life rankings  it's called the Mercer Survey. You may have heard of it. They rank hundreds of nations worldwide according to    criteria that they believe add up to quality of life  health  economics  education  housing  you name it. There's six more. Short talk. And it's very interesting to see that the highest ranking American city  Honolulu  number     is followed by kind of the usual suspects of Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities. The driving cities in the Sun Belt  the Dallases and the Phoenixes and  sorry  Atlanta  these cities are not appearing on the list. But who's doing even better  The Canadian cities like Vancouver  where again  they're burning half the fuel. And then it's usually won by cities where they speak German  like Dusseldorf or Vienna  where they're burning  again  half as much fuel. And you see this alignment  this strange alignment. Is being more sustainble what gives you a higher quality of life  I would argue the same thing that makes you more sustainble is what gives you a higher quality of life  and that's living in a walkable neighborhood. So sustainability  which includes our wealth and our health may not be a direct function of our sustainability. But particularly here in America  we are polluting so much because we're throwing away our time and our money and our lives on the highway  then these two problems would seem to share the same solution  which is to make our cities more walkable. Doing so isn't easy  but it can be done  it has been done  and it's being done now in more than a few cities  around the globe and in our country. I take some solace from Winston Churchill  who put it this way   The Americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives.   Laughter  Thank you. So I'd like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in China  the night I met my husband. It was a city so long ago that it was still called Peking. So I went to a party. I sat down next to a stout  middle aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie  and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar  there in China specifically to study Sino Soviet relations. What a gift it was to the eager  young foreign correspondent that I was then. I'd pump him for information  I'm mentally scribbling notes for the stories I plan to write. I talk to him for hours. Only months later  I discover who he really was. He was the China representative for the American Soybean Association.  I don't understand. Soybeans  You told me you were a Fulbright scholar.   Well  how long would you have talked to me if I told you we're in soybeans   I said   You jerk.  Only jerk wasn't the word I used. I said   You could've gotten me fired.  And he said   Let's get married.   Travel the world and have lots of kids.  So we did. And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley turned out to be. He was a Chinese scholar who later  in his   s  got a Ph.D. in Chinese history. He spoke six languages  he played    musical instruments  he was a licensed pilot  he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator  he was an expert in swine nutrition  dairy cattle  Dixieland jazz  film noir  and we did travel the country  and the world  and we did have a lot of kids. We followed my job  and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn't do. So when we found the cancer  it doesn't seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other  we believed that  if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough  and we worked hard enough  we could keep him from dying ever. And for years  it seemed like we were succeeding. The surgeon emerged from the surgery. What'd he say  He said what surgeons always say   We got it all.  Then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely. It turned out to be a rare  exceedingly aggressive type  with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in several weeks at most. And yet  he did not die. Mysteriously  he lived on. He coached Little League for our son. He built a playhouse for our daughter. And meanwhile  I'm burying myself in the Internet looking for specialists. I'm looking for a cure. So a year goes by before the cancer  as cancers do  reappears  and with it comes another death sentence  this time nine months. So we try another treatment  aggressive  nasty. It makes him so sick  he has to quit it  yet still he lives on. Then another year goes by. Two years go by. More specialists. We take the kids to Italy. We take the kids to Australia. And then more years pass  and the cancer begins to grow. This time  there's new treatments on the horizon. They're exotic. They're experimental. They're going to attack the cancer in new ways. So he enters a clinical trial  and it works. The cancer begins to shrink  and for the third time  we've dodged death. So now I ask you  how do I feel when the time finally comes and there's another dark night  sometime between midnight and   a.m.  This time it's on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that I've never met before tells me that Terence is dying  perhaps tonight. So what do I say when he says   What do you want me to do   There's another drug out there. It's newer. It's more powerful. He started it just two weeks ago. Perhaps there's still hope ahead. So what do I say  I say   Keep him alive if you can.  And Terence died six days later. So we fought  we struggled  we triumphed. It was an exhilarating fight  and I'd repeat the fight today without a moment's hesitation. We fought together  we lived together. It turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious. It was also an expensive fight. It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end of life care  and of healthcare for all of us. And for me  for us  we pushed the fight right over the edge  and I never got the chance to say to him what I say to him now almost every day   Hey  buddy  it was a hell of a ride.  We never got the chance to say goodbye. We never thought it was the end. We always had hope. So what do we make of all of this  Being a journalist  after Terence died  I wrote a book   The Cost Of Hope.  I wrote it because I wanted to know why I did what I did  why he did what he did  why everyone around us did what they did. And what did I discover  Well  one of the things I discovered is that experts think that one answer to what I did at the end was a piece of paper  the advance directive  to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices. Yet I had that piece of paper. We both did. And they were readily available. I had them right at hand. Both of them said the same thing  Do nothing if there is no further hope. I knew Terence's wishes as clearly and as surely as I knew my own. Yet we never got to no further hope. Even with that clear cut paper in our hands  we just kept redefining hope. I believed I could keep him from dying  and I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way. Right up until days before his death  I felt strongly and powerfully  and  you might say  irrationally  that I could keep him from dying ever. Now  what do the experts call this  They say it's denial. It's a strong word  isn't it  Yet I will tell you that denial isn't even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through. And I hear the medical professionals say   Well  we'd like to do such and such  but the family's in denial. The family won't listen to reason. They're in denial. How can they insist on this treatment at the end  It's so clear  yet they're in denial.  Now  I think this maybe isn't a very useful way of thinking. It's not just families either. The medical professionals too  you out there  you're in denial too. You want to help. You want to fix. You want to do. You've succeeded in everything you've done  and having a patient die  well  that must feel like failure. I saw it firsthand. Just days before Terence died  his oncologist said   Tell Terence that better days are just ahead.  Days before he died. Yet Ira Byock  the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth said   You know  the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal.  So what the experts call  denial   I call  hope   and I'd like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design. You just redefine denial and hope  and it becomes a feature of being human. It's not a bug. It's a feature. So we need to think more constructively about this very common  very profound and very powerful human emotion. It's part of the human condition  and yet our system and our thinking isn't built to accommodate it. So Terence told me a story on that long ago night  and I believed it. Maybe I wanted to believe it. And during Terence's illness  I  we  we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too. Giving up the fight    for that's how it felt  it felt like giving up    meant giving up not only his life but also our story  our story of us as fighters  the story of us as invincible  and for the doctors  the story of themselves as healers. So what do we need  Maybe we don't need a new piece of paper. Maybe we need a new story  not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness  but rather a story of victory and triumph  of a valiant battle and  eventually  a graceful retreat  a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe  that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal  and that no wife  no matter how hard she tried  has ever stopped even the bravest  wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go. People did mention hospice  but I wouldn't listen. Hospice was for people who were dying  and Terence wasn't dying. As a result  he spent just four days in hospice  which I'm sure  as you all know  is a pretty typical outcome  and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end. We have a noble path to curing the disease  patients and doctors alike  but there doesn't seem to be a noble path to dying. Dying is seen as failing  and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together  but we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go. So maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end  and for saying goodbye  and maybe our new story will be about a hero's fight  and a hero's goodbye. Terence loved poetry  and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy is one of my favorite poets. So I'll give you a couple lines from him. This is a poem about Mark Antony. You know Mark Antony  the conquering hero  Cleopatra's guy  Actually  one of Cleopatra's guys. And he's been a pretty good general. He's won all the fights  he's eluded all the people that are out to get him  and yet this time  finally  he's come to the city of Alexandria and realized he's lost. The people are leaving. They're playing instruments. They're singing. And suddenly he knows he's been defeated. And he suddenly knows he's been deserted by the gods  and it's time to let go. And the poet tells him what to do. He tells him how to say a noble goodbye  a goodbye that's fit for a hero.  As if long prepared  as if courageous  as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city  approach the window with a firm step  and with emotion  but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward  as a last enjoyment  listen to the sounds  the exquisite instruments of the musical troops  and bid her farewell  the Alexandria you are losing.  That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life  a goodbye for a man for whom anything  well  almost anything  was possible  a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive. And isn't that what we're missing  How can we learn that people's decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly  powerfully  many times irrationally  on the slimmest of hopes  The overwhelming presence of hope isn't denial. It's part of our DNA as humans  and maybe it's time our healthcare system    doctors  patients  insurance companies  us  started accounting for the power of that hope. Hope isn't a bug. It's a feature. Thank you. Throughout my career  I've been fortunate enough to work with many of the great international architects  documenting their work and observing how their designs have the capacity to influence the cities in which they sit. I think of new cities like Dubai or ancient cities like Rome with Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum  or like right here in New York with the High Line  a city which has been so much influenced by the development of this. But what I find really fascinating is what happens when architects and planners leave and these places become appropriated by people  like here in Chandigarh  India  the city which has been completely designed by the architect Le Corbusier. Now    years later  the city has been taken over by people in very different ways from whatever perhaps intended for  like here  where you have the people sitting in the windows of the assembly hall. But over the course of several years  I've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's CCTV building in Beijing and the olympic stadium in the same city by the architects Herzog and de Meuron. At these large scale construction sites in China  you see a sort of makeshift camp where workers live during the entire building process. As the length of the construction takes years  workers end up forming a rather rough and ready informal city  making for quite a juxtaposition against the sophisticated structures that they're building. Over the past seven years  I've been following my fascination with the built environment  and for those of you who know me  you would say that this obsession has led me to live out of a suitcase     days a year. Being constantly on the move means that sometimes I am able to catch life's most unpredictable moments  like here in New York the day after the Sandy storm hit the city. Just over three years ago  I was for the first time in Caracas  Venezuela  and while flying over the city  I was just amazed by the extent to which the slums reach into every corner of the city  a place where nearly    percent of the population lives in slums  draped literally all over the mountains. During a conversation with local architects Urban Think Tank  I learned about the Torre David  a    story office building which sits right in the center of Caracas. The building was under construction until the collapse of the Venezuelan economy and the death of the developer in the early '  s. About eight years ago  people started moving into the abandoned tower and began to build their homes right in between every column of this unfinished tower. There's only one little entrance to the entire building  and the       residents come in and out through that single door. Together  the inhabitants created public spaces and designed them to feel more like a home and less like an unfinished tower. In the lobby  they painted the walls and planted trees. They also made a basketball court. But when you look up closely  you see massive holes where elevators and services would have run through. Within the tower  people have come up with all sorts of solutions in response to the various needs which arise from living in an unfinished tower. With no elevators  the tower is like a    story walkup. Designed in very specific ways by this group of people who haven't had any education in architecture or design. And with each inhabitant finding their own unique way of coming by  this tower becomes like a living city  a place which is alive with micro economies and small businesses. The inventive inhabitants  for instance  find opportunities in the most unexpected cases  like the adjacent parking garage  which has been reclaimed as a taxi route to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps in order to shorten the hike up to the apartments. A walk through the tower reveals how residents have figured out how to create walls  how to make an air flow  how to create transparency  circulation throughout the tower  essentially creating a home that's completely adapted to the conditions of the site. When a new inhabitant moves into the tower  they already have a roof over their head  so they just typically mark their space with a few curtains or sheets. Slowly  from found materials  walls rise  and people create a space out of any found objects or materials. It's remarkable to see the design decisions that they're making  like when everything is made out of red bricks  some residents will cover that red brick with another layer of red brick patterned wallpaper just to make it a kind of clean finish. The inhabitants literally built up these homes with their own hands  and this labor of love instills a great sense of pride in many families living in this tower. They typically make the best out of their conditions  and try to make their spaces look nice and homey  or at least up until as far as they can reach. Throughout the tower  you come across all kinds of services  like the barber  small factories  and every floor has a little grocery store or shop. And you even find a church. And on the   th floor  there is a gym where all the weights and barbells are made out of the leftover pulleys from the elevators which were never installed. From the outside  behind this always changing facade  you see how the fixed concrete beams provide a framework for the inhabitants to create their homes in an organic  intuitive way that responds directly to their needs. Let's go now to Africa  to Nigeria  to a community called Makoko  a slum where         people live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon. While it may appear to be a completely chaotic place  when you see it from above  there seems to be a whole grid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home. From the main dock  people board long wooden canoes which carry them out to their various homes and shops located in the expansive area. When out on the water  it's clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific way of living. Even the canoes become variety stores where ladies paddle from house to house  selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits. Behind every window and door frame  you'll see a small child peering back at you  and while Makoko seems to be packed with people  what's more shocking is actually the amount of children pouring out of every building. The population growth in Nigeria  and especially in these areas like Makoko  are painful reminders of how out of control things really are. In Makoko  very few systems and infrastructures exist. Electricity is rigged and freshest water comes from self built wells throughout the area. This entire economic model is designed to meet a specific way of living on the water  so fishing and boat making are common professions. You'll have a set of entrepreneurs who have set up businesses throughout the area  like barbershops  CD and DVD stores  movie theaters  tailors  everything is there. There is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or to be associated with a faraway place  like that hotel in Sweden. On this particular evening  I came across this live band dressed to the T in their coordinating outfits. They were floating through the canals in a large canoe with a fitted out generator for all of the community to enjoy. By nightfall  the area becomes almost pitch black  save for a small lightbulb or a fire. What originally brought me to Makoko was this project from a friend of mine  Kunl  Adeyemi  who recently finished building this three story floating school for the kids in Makoko. With this entire village existing on the water  public space is very limited  so now that the school is finished  the ground floor is a playground for the kids  but when classes are out  the platform is just like a town square  where the fishermen mend their nets and floating shopkeepers dock their boats. Another place I'd like to share with you is the Zabbaleen in Cairo. They're descendants of farmers who began migrating from the upper Egypt in the '  s  and today they make their living by collecting and recycling waste from homes from all over Cairo. For years  the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages where they would move around trying to avoid the local authorities  but in the early     s  they settled on the Mokattam rocks just at the eastern edge of the city. Today  they live in this area  approximately        to        people  who live in this community of self built multi story houses where up to three generations live in one structure. While these apartments that they built for themselves appear to lack any planning or formal grid  each family specializing in a certain form of recycling means that the ground floor of each apartment is reserved for garbage related activities and the upper floor is dedicated to living space. I find it incredible to see how these piles and piles of garbage are invisible to the people who live there  like this very distinguished man who is posing while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him  or like these two young men who are sitting and chatting amongst these tons of garbage. While to most of us  living amongst these piles and piles of garbage may seem totally uninhabitable  to those in the Zabbaleen  this is just a different type of normal. In all these places I've talked about today  what I do find fascinating is that there's really no such thing as normal  and it proves that people are able to adapt to any kind of situation. Throughout the day  it's quite common to come across a small party taking place in the streets  just like this engagement party. In this tradition  the bride to be displays all of their belongings  which they soon bring to their new husband. A gathering like this one offers such a juxtaposition where all the new stuff is displayed and all the garbage is used as props to display all their new home accessories. Like Makoko and the Torre David  throughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood. There are the retail shops  the cafes and the restaurants  and the community is this community of Coptic Christians  so you'll also find a church  along with the scores of religious iconographies throughout the area  and also all the everyday services like the electronic repair shops  the barbers  everything. Visiting the homes of the Zabbaleen is also full of surprises. While from the outside  these homes look like any other informal structure in the city  when you step inside  you are met with all manner of design decisions and interior decoration. Despite having limited access to space and money  the homes in the area are designed with care and detail. Every apartment is unique  and this individuality tells a story about each family's circumstances and values. Many of these people take their homes and interior spaces very seriously  putting a lot of work and care into the details. The shared spaces are also treated in the same manner  where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns. But despite this elaborate decor  sometimes these apartments are used in very unexpected ways  like this home which caught my attention while all the mud and the grass was literally seeping out under the front door. When I was let in  it appeared that this fifth floor apartment was being transformed into a complete animal farm  where six or seven cows stood grazing in what otherwise would be the living room. But then in the apartment across the hall from this cow shed lives a newly married couple in what locals describe as one of the nicest apartments in the area. The attention to this detail astonished me  and as the owner of the home so proudly led me around this apartment  from floor to ceiling  every part was decorated. But if it weren't for the strangely familiar stomach churning odor that constantly passes through the apartment  it would be easy to forget that you are standing next to a cow shed and on top of a landfill. What moved me the most was that despite these seemingly inhospitable conditions  I was welcomed with open arms into a home that was made with love  care  and unreserved passion. Let's move across the map to China  to an area called Shanxi  Henan and Gansu. In a region famous for the soft  porous Loess Plateau soil  there lived until recently an estimated    million people in these houses underground. These dwellings are called the yaodongs. Through this architecture by subtraction  these yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil. In these villages  you see an entirely altered landscape  and hidden behind these mounds of dirt are these square  rectangular houses which sit seven meters below the ground. When I asked people why they were digging their houses from the ground  they simply replied that they are poor wheat and apple farmers who didn't have the money to buy materials  and this digging out was their most logical form of living. From Makoko to Zabbaleen  these communities have approached the tasks of planning  design and management of their communities and neighborhoods in ways that respond specifically to their environment and circumstances. Created by these very people who live  work and play in these particular spaces  these neighborhoods are intuitively designed to make the most of their circumstances. In most of these places  the government is completely absent  leaving inhabitants with no choice but to reappropriate found materials  and while these communities are highly disadvantaged  they do present examples of brilliant forms of ingenuity  and prove that indeed we have the ability to adapt to all manner of circumstances. What makes places like the Torre David particularly remarkable is this sort of skeleton framework where people can have a foundation where they can tap into. Now imagine what these already ingenious communities could create themselves  and how highly particular their solutions would be  if they were given the basic infrastructures that they could tap into. Today  you see these large residential development projects which offer cookie cutter housing solutions to massive amounts of people. From China to Brazil  these projects attempt to provide as many houses as possible  but they're completely generic and simply do not work as an answer to the individual needs of the people. I would like to end with a quote from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration  Zita Cobb  the founder of the wonderful Shorefast Foundation  based out of Fogo Island  Newfoundland. She says that  there's this plague of sameness which is killing the human joy   and I couldn't agree with her more. Thank you. I would like to tell you a story connecting the notorious privacy incident involving Adam and Eve  and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between public and private which has occurred in the past    years. You know the incident. Adam and Eve one day in the Garden of Eden realize they are naked. They freak out. And the rest is history. Nowadays  Adam and Eve would probably act differently.   Adam Last nite was a blast  loved dat apple LOL    Eve yep.. babe  know what happened to my pants tho   We do reveal so much more information about ourselves online than ever before  and so much information about us is being collected by organizations. Now there is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information  or big data  but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy. And my story is about these tradeoffs. We start with an observation which  in my mind  has become clearer and clearer in the past few years  that any personal information can become sensitive information. Back in the year       about     billion photos were shot worldwide  but only a minuscule proportion of them were actually uploaded online. In       only on Facebook  in a single month   .  billion photos were uploaded  most of them identified. In the same span of time  computers' ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude. What happens when you combine these technologies together  increasing availability of facial data  improving facial recognizing ability by computers  but also cloud computing  which gives anyone in this theater the kind of computational power which a few years ago was only the domain of three letter agencies  and ubiquitous computing  which allows my phone  which is not a supercomputer  to connect to the Internet and do there hundreds of thousands of face metrics in a few seconds  Well  we conjecture that the result of this combination of technologies will be a radical change in our very notions of privacy and anonymity. To test that  we did an experiment on Carnegie Mellon University campus. We asked students who were walking by to participate in a study  and we took a shot with a webcam  and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop. While they were filling out the survey  we uploaded their shot to a cloud computing cluster  and we started using a facial recognizer to match that shot to a database of some hundreds of thousands of images which we had downloaded from Facebook profiles. By the time the subject reached the last page on the survey  the page had been dynamically updated with the    best matching photos which the recognizer had found  and we asked the subjects to indicate whether he or she found themselves in the photo. Do you see the subject  Well  the computer did  and in fact did so for one out of three subjects. So essentially  we can start from an anonymous face  offline or online  and we can use facial recognition to give a name to that anonymous face thanks to social media data. But a few years back  we did something else. We started from social media data  we combined it statistically with data from U.S. government social security  and we ended up predicting social security numbers  which in the United States are extremely sensitive information. Do you see where I'm going with this  So if you combine the two studies together  then the question becomes  can you start from a face and  using facial recognition  find a name and publicly available information about that name and that person  and from that publicly available information infer non publicly available information  much more sensitive ones which you link back to the face  And the answer is  yes  we can  and we did. Of course  the accuracy keeps getting worse.      of subjects' first   SSN digits identified  with   attempts   But in fact  we even decided to develop an iPhone app which uses the phone's internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to a cloud and then do what I just described to you in real time  looking for a match  finding public information  trying to infer sensitive information  and then sending back to the phone so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject  an example of augmented reality  probably a creepy example of augmented reality. In fact  we didn't develop the app to make it available  just as a proof of concept. In fact  take these technologies and push them to their logical extreme. Imagine a future in which strangers around you will look at you through their Google Glasses or  one day  their contact lenses  and use seven or eight data points about you to infer anything else which may be known about you. What will this future without secrets look like  And should we care  We may like to believe that the future with so much wealth of data would be a future with no more biases  but in fact  having so much information doesn't mean that we will make decisions which are more objective. In another experiment  we presented to our subjects information about a potential job candidate. We included in this information some references to some funny  absolutely legal  but perhaps slightly embarrassing information that the subject had posted online. Now interestingly  among our subjects  some had posted comparable information  and some had not. Which group do you think was more likely to judge harshly our subject  Paradoxically  it was the group who had posted similar information  an example of moral dissonance. Now you may be thinking  this does not apply to me  because I have nothing to hide. But in fact  privacy is not about having something negative to hide. Imagine that you are the H.R. director of a certain organization  and you receive r sum s  and you decide to find more information about the candidates. Therefore  you Google their names and in a certain universe  you find this information. Or in a parallel universe  you find this information. Do you think that you would be equally likely to call either candidate for an interview  If you think so  then you are not like the U.S. employers who are  in fact  part of our experiment  meaning we did exactly that. We created Facebook profiles  manipulating traits  then we started sending out r sum s to companies in the U.S.  and we detected  we monitored  whether they were searching for our candidates  and whether they were acting on the information they found on social media. And they were. Discrimination was happening through social media for equally skilled candidates. Now marketers like us to believe that all information about us will always be used in a manner which is in our favor. But think again. Why should that be always the case  In a movie which came out a few years ago   Minority Report   a famous scene had Tom Cruise walk in a mall and holographic personalized advertising would appear around him. Now  that movie is set in       about    years from now  and as exciting as that technology looks  it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about you  and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect. So as an example  this is another experiment actually we are running  not yet completed. Imagine that an organization has access to your list of Facebook friends  and through some kind of algorithm they can detect the two friends that you like the most. And then they create  in real time  a facial composite of these two friends. Now studies prior to ours have shown that people don't recognize any longer even themselves in facial composites  but they react to those composites in a positive manner. So next time you are looking for a certain product  and there is an ad suggesting you to buy it  it will not be just a standard spokesperson. It will be one of your friends  and you will not even know that this is happening. Now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information are like bringing a knife to a gunfight. One of these mechanisms is transparency  telling people what you are going to do with their data. And in principle  that's a very good thing. It's necessary  but it is not sufficient. Transparency can be misdirected. You can tell people what you are going to do  and then you still nudge them to disclose arbitrary amounts of personal information. So in yet another experiment  this one with students  we asked them to provide information about their campus behavior  including pretty sensitive questions  such as this one.  Have you ever cheated in an exam   Now to one group of subjects  we told them   Only other students will see your answers.  To another group of subjects  we told them   Students and faculty will see your answers.  Transparency. Notification. And sure enough  this worked  in the sense that the first group of subjects were much more likely to disclose than the second. It makes sense  right  But then we added the misdirection. We repeated the experiment with the same two groups  this time adding a delay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started answering the questions. How long a delay do you think we had to add in order to nullify the inhibitory effect of knowing that faculty would see your answers  Ten minutes  Five minutes  One minute  How about    seconds  Fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groups disclose the same amount of information  as if the second group now no longer cares for faculty reading their answers. Now I have to admit that this talk so far may sound exceedingly gloomy  but that is not my point. In fact  I want to share with you the fact that there are alternatives. The way we are doing things now is not the only way they can done  and certainly not the best way they can be done. When someone tells you   People don't care about privacy   consider whether the game has been designed and rigged so that they cannot care about privacy  and coming to the realization that these manipulations occur is already halfway through the process of being able to protect yourself. When someone tells you that privacy is incompatible with the benefits of big data  consider that in the last    years  researchers have created technologies to allow virtually any electronic transactions to take place in a more privacy preserving manner. We can browse the Internet anonymously. We can send emails that can only be read by the intended recipient  not even the NSA. We can have even privacy preserving data mining. In other words  we can have the benefits of big data while protecting privacy. Of course  these technologies imply a shifting of cost and revenues between data holders and data subjects  which is why  perhaps  you don't hear more about them. Which brings me back to the Garden of Eden. There is a second privacy interpretation of the story of the Garden of Eden which doesn't have to do with the issue of Adam and Eve feeling naked and feeling ashamed. You can find echoes of this interpretation in John Milton's  Paradise Lost.  In the garden  Adam and Eve are materially content. They're happy. They are satisfied. However  they also lack knowledge and self awareness. The moment they eat the aptly named fruit of knowledge  that's when they discover themselves. They become aware. They achieve autonomy. The price to pay  however  is leaving the garden. So privacy  in a way  is both the means and the price to pay for freedom. Again  marketers tell us that big data and social media are not just a paradise of profit for them  but a Garden of Eden for the rest of us. We get free content. We get to play Angry Birds. We get targeted apps. But in fact  in a few years  organizations will know so much about us  they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them  and perhaps buy products on our behalf before we even know we need them. Now there was one English author who anticipated this kind of future where we would trade away our autonomy and freedom for comfort. Even more so than George Orwell  the author is  of course  Aldous Huxley. In  Brave New World   he imagines a society where technologies that we created originally for freedom end up coercing us. However  in the book  he also offers us a way out of that society  similar to the path that Adam and Eve had to follow to leave the garden. In the words of the Savage  regaining autonomy and freedom is possible  although the price to pay is steep. So I do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information  the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom  rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us. Right now  many of us do not even know that the fight is going on  but it is  whether you like it or not. And at the risk of playing the serpent  I will tell you that the tools for the fight are here  the awareness of what is going on  and in your hands  just a few clicks away. Thank you. Hetain Patel   In Chinese  Yuyu Rau  Hi  I'm Hetain. I'm an artist. And this is Yuyu  who is a dancer I have been working with. I have asked her to translate for me. HP   In Chinese  YR  If I may  I would like to tell you a little bit about myself and my artwork. HP   In Chinese  YR  I was born and raised near Manchester  in England  but I'm not going to say it in English to you  because I'm trying to avoid any assumptions that might be made from my northern accent. HP   In Chinese  YR  The only problem with masking it with Chinese Mandarin is I can only speak this paragraph  which I have learned by heart when I was visiting in China.  Laughter  So all I can do is keep repeating it in different tones and hope you won't notice. HP   In Chinese  YR  Needless to say  I would like to apologize to any Mandarin speakers in the audience. As a child  I would hate being made to wear the Indian kurta pajama  because I didn't think it was very cool. It felt a bit girly to me  like a dress  and it had this baggy trouser part you had to tie really tight to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down. My dad never wore it  so I didn't see why I had to. Also  it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable  that people assume I represent something genuinely Indian when I wear it  because that's not how I feel. HP   In Chinese  YR  Actually  the only way I feel comfortable wearing it is by pretending they are the robes of a kung fu warrior like Li Mu Bai from that film   Crouching Tiger  Hidden Dragon.  Okay. So my artwork is about identity and language  challenging common assumptions based on how we look like or where we come from  gender  race  class. What makes us who we are anyway  HP   In Chinese  YR  I used to read Spider Man comics  watch kung fu movies  take philosophy lessons from Bruce Lee. He would say things like    HP  Empty your mind. Be formless  shapeless  like water. Now you put water into a cup. It becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle  it becomes the bottle. Put it in a teapot  it becomes the teapot. Now  water can flow or it can crash. Be water  my friend.  Applause  YR  This year  I am    years old  the same age Bruce Lee was when he died. I have been wondering recently  if he were alive today  what advice he would give me about making this TED Talk. HP  Don't imitate my voice. It offends me. YR  Good advice  but I still think that we learn who we are by copying others. Who here hasn't imitated their childhood hero in the playground  or mum or father  I have. HP  A few years ago  in order to make this video for my artwork  I shaved off all my hair so that I could grow it back as my father had it when he first emigrated from India to the U.K. in the     s. He had a side parting and a neat mustache. At first  it was going very well. I even started to get discounts in Indian shops. But then very quickly  I started to underestimate my mustache growing ability  and it got way too big. It didn't look Indian anymore. Instead  people from across the road  they would shout things like    HP and YR  Arriba  Arriba   ndale   ndale  HP  Actually  I don't know why I am even talking like this. My dad doesn't even have an Indian accent anymore. He talks like this now. So it's not just my father that I've imitated. A few years ago I went to China for a few months  and I couldn't speak Chinese  and this frustrated me  so I wrote about this and had it translated into Chinese  and then I learned this by heart  like music  I guess. YR  This phrase is now etched into my mind clearer than the pin number to my bank card  so I can pretend I speak Chinese fluently. When I had learned this phrase  I had an artist over there hear me out to see how accurate it sounded. I spoke the phrase  and then he laughed and told me   Oh yeah  that's great  only it kind of sounds like a woman.  I said   What   He said   Yeah  you learned from a woman   I said   Yes. So   He then explained the tonal differences between male and female voices are very different and distinct  and that I had learned it very well  but in a woman's voice. HP  Okay. So this imitation business does come with risk. It doesn't always go as you plan it  even with a talented translator. But I am going to stick with it  because contrary to what we might usually assume  imitating somebody can reveal something unique. So every time I fail to become more like my father  I become more like myself. Every time I fail to become Bruce Lee  I become more authentically me. This is my art. I strive for authenticity  even if it comes in a shape that we might not usually expect. It's only recently that I've started to understand that I didn't learn to sit like this through being Indian. I learned this from Spider Man. Thank you. I've spent my life working on sustainability. I set up a climate change NGO called The Climate Group. I worked on forestry issues in WWF. I worked on development and agriculture issues in the U.N. system. About    years in total  and then three years ago  I found myself talking to IKEA's CEO about joining his team. Like many people here  well  I want to maximize my personal impact in the world  so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there. But first  let's just take three numbers. The first number is three  three billion people. This is the number of people joining the global middle class by       coming out of poverty. It's fantastic for them and their families  but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today  and this swells that number to five  a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity. The second number is six  This is six degrees centigrade  what we're heading towards in terms of global warming. We're not heading towards one degree or three degrees or four degrees  we're heading toward six degrees. And if you think about it  all of the weird weather we've been having the last few years  much of that is due to just one degree warming  and we need CO  emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down. It's not inevitable  but we need to act decisively. The third number is     That's the number of cities in the world that had a million or more people when my grandmother was born. You can see my grandmother there. That was in the beginning of the last century. So just    cities. She was born in Manchester  England  the ninth largest city in the world. Now there are     cities  nearly  with a million people or more in them. And if you look at the century from      to       that's the century when we build all the world's cities  the century that we're in the middle of right now. Every other century was kind of practice  and this lays down a blueprint for how we live. So think about it. We're building cities like never before  bringing people out of poverty like never before  and changing the climate like never before. Sustainability has gone from a nice to do to a must do. it's about what we do right here  right now  and for the rest of our working lives. So I'm going to talk a little bit about what business can do and what a business like IKEA can do  and we have a sustainability strategy called  people and planet positive  to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world. Why would we not want to have a positive impact on the world as a business  Other companies have sustainability strategies. I'm going to refer to some of those as well  and I'm just going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we've got. But first  let's think of customers. We know from asking people from China to the U.S. that the vast majority of people care about sustainability after the day to day issues  the day to day issues of  how do I get my kids to school  Can I pay the bills at the end of the month  Then they care about big issues like climate change. But they want it to be easy  affordable and attractive  and they expect business to help  and they're a little bit disappointed today. So take your mind back and think of the first sustainable products. We had detergents that could wash your whites grayer. We had the early energy efficient light bulbs that took five minutes to warm up and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color. And we had the rough  recycled toilet paper. So every time you pulled on a t shirt  or switched the light on  or went to the bathroom  or sometimes all three together  you were reminded sustainability was about compromise. It wasn't a great start. Today we have choices. We can make products that are beautiful or ugly  sustainable or unsustainable  affordable or expensive  functional or useless. So let's make beautiful  functional  affordable  sustainable products. Let's take the LED. The LED is the next best thing to daylight. The old fashioned lightbulbs  the incandescent bulbs    I'm not going to ask for a show of hands of how many of you still have them in your homes  wasting energy every time you switch them on    change them after this    or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not    but those old incandescent light bulbs really should have been sold as heaters. They were mis sold for more than a hundred years. They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side. Now we have lights that produce light and a little bit of heat on the side. You save    percent of the electricity with an LED that you would have done in an old incandescent. And the best thing is  they'll also last for more than    years. So think about that. You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times  probably more if you're in this audience. You'll change your car  if you have one  three or four times. Your kids could go to school  go to college  go away and have kids of their own  come back  bring the grandkids  you'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy. So LEDs are fantastic. What we decided to do was not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high and continue to push all the old bulbs  the halogens and the CFLs. We decided  over the next two years  we will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves. We will go all in. And this is what business needs to do  go all in  go     percent  because then you stop investing in the old stuff  you invest in the new stuff  you lower costs  you use your supply chain and your creativity and you get the prices down so everybody can afford the best lights so they can save energy. It's not just about products in people's homes. We've got to think about the raw materials that produce our products. Obviously there's fantastic opportunities with recycled materials  and we can and will go zero waste. And there's opportunities in a circular economy. But we're still dependent on natural  raw materials. Let's take cotton. Cotton's brilliant. Probably many people are wearing cotton right now. It's a brilliant textile in use. It's really dirty in production. It uses lots of pesticides  lots of fertilizer  lots of water. So we've worked with others  with other businesses and NGOs  on the Better Cotton Initiative  working right back down to the farm  and there you can halve the amount of water and halve the chemical inputs  the yields increase  and    percent of the costs of running many of these farms with farmers with low incomes can be chemical imports. Yields increase  and you halve the input costs. Farmers are coming out of poverty. They love it. Already hundreds of thousands of farmers have been reached  and now we've got    percent better cotton in our business. Again  we're going all in. By       we'll be     percent Better Cotton. Take the topic of     percent targets  actually. People sometimes think that     percent's going to be hard  and we've had the conversation in the business. Actually  we found     percent is easier to do than    percent or    percent. If you have a    percent target  everyone in the business finds a reason to be in the    percent. When it's     percent  it's kind of clear  and businesspeople like clarity  because then you just get the job done. So  wood. We know with forestry  it's a choice. You've got illegal logging and deforestation still on a very large scale  or you can have fantastic  responsible forestry that we can be proud of. It's a simple choice  so we've worked for many years with the Forest Stewardship Council  with literally hundreds of other organizations  and there's a point here about collaboration. So hundreds of others  of NGOs  of forest workers' unions  and of businesses  have helped create the Forest Stewardship Council  which sets standards for forestry and then checks the forestry's good on the ground. Now together  through our supply chain  with partners  we've managed to certify    million hectares of forestry. That's about the size of Germany. And we've decided in the next three years  we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business. So be decisive on these issues. Use your supply chain to drive good. But then it comes to your operations. Some things are certain  I think. We know we'll use electricity in    or    years' time. We know the sun will be shining somewhere  and the wind will still be blowing in    or    years' time. So why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind  And why not take control of it ourselves  So we're going     percent renewable. By       we'll produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume as a business. For all of our stores  our own factories  our distribution centers  we've installed         solar panels so far  and we've got    wind farms we own and operate in six countries  and we're not done yet. But think of a solar panel. A solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years. The electricity is free. Every time the sun comes out after that  the electricity is free. So this is a good thing for the CFO  not just the sustainability guy. Every business can do things like this. But then we've got to look beyond our operations  and I think everybody would agree that now business has to take full responsibility for the impacts of your supply chain. Many businesses now  fortunately  have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains  but not every business. Far from it. And this came in IKEA actually in the '  s. We found there was a risk of child labor in the supply chain  and people in the business were shocked. And it was clearly totally unacceptable  so then you have to act. So a code of conduct was developed  and now we have    auditors out in the world every day making sure all our factories secure good working conditions and protect human rights and make sure there is no child labor. But it's not just as simple as making sure there's no child labor. You've got to say that's not enough today. I think we'd all agree that children are the most important people in the world and the most vulnerable. So what can a business do today to actually use your total value chain to support a better quality of life and protect child rights  We've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children on developing some new business principles with children's rights. Increasing numbers of businesses are signing up to these  but actually in a survey  many business leaders said they thought their business had nothing to do with children. So what we decided to do was  we will look and ask ourselves the tough questions with partners who know more than us  what can we do to go beyond our business to help improve the lives of children  We also have a foundation that's committed to work through partners and help improve the lives and protect the rights of     million children by     . You know the phrase  you can manage what you measure  Well  you should measure what you care about. If you're not measuring things  you don't care and you don't know. So let's take an example  measure the things that are important in your business. Isn't it about time that businesses were led equally by men and women  So we know for our        managers across IKEA that    percent are women today  but it's not enough  and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management. And we do not want to wait another hundred years. So we've launched a women's open network this week in IKEA  and we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change. So the message here is  measure what you care about and lead the change  and don't wait a hundred years. So we've gone from sustainability being a nice to do to a must do. It's a must do. It's still nice to do  but it's a must do. And everybody can do something on this as an individual. Be a discerning consumer. Vote with your wallets. Search out the companies that are acting on this. But also  there are other businesses already acting. I mentioned renewable energy. You go to Google or Lego  they're going     percent renewable too  in the same way that we are. On having really good sustainability strategies  there are companies like Nike  Patagonia  Timberland  Marks   Spencer. But I don't think any of those businesses would say they're perfect. We certainly wouldn't. We'll make mistakes going forward  but it's about setting a clear direction  being transparent  having a dialogue with the right partners  and choosing to lead on the issues that really count. So if you're a business leader  if you're not already weaving sustainability right into the heart of your business model  I'd urge you to do so. And together  we can help create a sustainable world  and  if we get it right  we can make sustainability affordable for the many people  not a luxury for the few. Thank you. Africa is booming. Per capita incomes since the year      have doubled  and this boom is impacting on everyone. Life expectancy has increased by one year every three years for the last decade. That means if an African child is born today  rather than three days ago  they will get an extra day of life at the end of their lifespan. It's that quick. And HIV infection rates are down    percent          less people a year are getting HIV in sub Saharan Africa. The battle against malaria is being won  with deaths from malaria down    percent  according to the latest World Bank data. And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that. This shouldn't surprise us  because actually  everybody grows. If you go back to Imperial Rome in the Year   A.D.  there was admittedly about       years where there wasn't an awful lot of growth. But then the people that the Romans would have called Scottish barbarians  my ancestors  were actually part of the Industrial Revolution  and in the   th century  growth began to accelerate  and you saw that get quicker and quicker  and it's been impacting everyone. It doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore or the tundra of northern Finland. Everybody gets involved. It's just a matter of when the inevitable happens. Among the reasons I think it's happening right now is the quality of the leadership across Africa. I think most of us would agree that in the     s  the greatest politician in the world was African  but I'm meeting brilliant people across the continent the entire time  and they're doing the reforms which have transformed the economic situation for their countries. And the West is engaging with that. The West has given debt forgiveness programs which have halved sub Saharan debt from about    percent of GDP down to about   . At the same time  our debt level's gone up to     and we're all feeling slightly miserable as a result. Politics gets weaker when debt is high. When public sector debt is low  governments don't have to choose between investing in education and health and paying interest on that debt you owe. And it's not just the public sector which is looking so good. The private sector as well. Again  in the West  we have private sector debt of     percent of GDP in Spain  the U.K.  and the U.S. That's an awful lot of debt. Africa  many African countries  are sitting at    to    percent of GDP. If there's any continent that can do what China has done    China's at about     percent of GDP on that chart    if anyone can do what China has done in the last    years  it'll be Africa in the next   . So they've got great government finances  great private sector debt. Does anyone recognize this  In fact  they do. Foreign direct investment has poured into Africa in the last    years. Back in the '  s  no one touched the continent with a barge pole. And this investment is actually Western led. We hear a lot about China  and they do lend a lot of money  but    percent of the FDI in the last couple of years has come from Europe  America  Australia  Canada. Ten percent's come from India. And they're investing in energy. Africa produces    million barrels a day of oil now. It's the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia. And they're investing in telecoms  shopping malls. And this very encouraging story  I think  is partly demographic led. And it's not just about African demographics. I'm showing you the number of     to    year olds in various parts of the world  and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second. Ten years ago  say you're Foxconn setting up an iPhone factory  by chance. You might choose China  which is the bulk of that East Asian blue line  where there's     million young people  and every year until      that's getting bigger. Which means you're going to have new guys knocking on the door saying   Give us a job   and   I don't need a big pay rise  just please give me a job.  Now  that's completely changed now. This decade  we're going to see a     to    percent fall in the number of     to    year olds in China. So where do you set up your new factory  You look at South Asia  and people are. They're looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh  and they're also looking at Africa. And they're looking at Africa because that yellow line is showing you that the number of young Africans is going to continue to get bigger decade after decade after decade out to     . Now  there's a problem with lots of young people coming into any market  particularly when they're young men. A bit dangerous  sometimes. I think one of the crucial factors is how educated is that demographic  If you look at the red line here  what you're going to see is that in       just nine percent of kids were in secondary school education in sub Saharan Africa. Would you set up a factory in sub Sahara in the mid     s  Nobody else did. They chose instead Turkey and Mexico to set up the textiles factories  because their education levels were    to    percent. Today  sub Sahara is at the levels that Turkey and Mexico were at in     . They will get the textiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth. So what's Africa looking like today  This is how I look at Africa. It's a bit odd  because I'm an economist. Each little box is about a billion dollars  and you see that I pay an awful lot of attention to Nigeria sitting there in the middle. South Africa is playing a role. But when I'm thinking about the future  I'm actually most interested in Central  Western and Southern Africa. If I look at Africa by population  East Africa stands out as so much potential. And I'm showing you something else with these maps. I'm showing you democracy versus autocracy. Fragile democracies is the beige color. Strong democracies are the orange color. And what you'll see here is that most Africans are now living in democracies. Why does that matter  Because what people want is what politicians try  they don't always succeed  but they try and deliver. And what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on. In Ghana in the elections  in December       the battle between the two candidates was over education. One guy offered free secondary school education to all  not just    percent. The other guy had to say  I'm going to build    new schools. He won by a margin. So democracy is encouraging governments to invest in education. Education is helping growth and investment  and that's giving budget revenues  which is giving governments more money  which is helping growth through education. It's a positive  virtuous circle. But I get asked this question  and this particular question makes me quite sad  It's   But what about corruption  How can you invest in Africa when there's corruption   And what makes me sad about it is that this graph here is showing you that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth. When you're poor  corruption is not your biggest priority. And the countries on the right hand side  you'll see the per capita GDP  basically every country with a per capita GDP of  say  less than       dollars  has got a corruption score of roughly  what's that  about three  Three out of   . That's not good. Every poor country is corrupt. Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt. How do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption  You see the middle class grow. And the way to do that is to invest  not to say I'm not investing in that continent because there's too much corruption. Now  I don't want to be an apologist for corruption. I've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe    not in Africa  actually. But what I'm saying here is that we can make a difference and we can do that by investing. Now I'm going to let you in on a little not so secret. Economists aren't great at forecasting. Because the question really is  what happens next  And if you go back to the year       what you'll find is The Economist had a very famous cover   The Hopeless Continent   and what they'd done is they'd looked at growth in Africa over the previous    years    two percent    and they said  what's going to happen in the next    years  They assumed two percent  and that made it a pretty hopeless story  because population growth was two and a half. People got poorer in Africa in the     s. Now       The Economist has a new cover  and what does that new cover show  That new cover shows  well  Africa rising  because the growth over the last    years has been about five and a half percent. I would like to see if you can all now become economists  because if growth for the last    years has been five and a half percent  what do you think the IMF is forecasting for the next five years of growth in Africa  Very good. I think you're secretly saying to your head  probably five and a half percent. You're all economists  and I think  like most economists  wrong. No offense. What I like to do is try and find the countries that are doing exactly what Africa has already done  and it means that jump from       years of nothing to whoof  suddenly shooting through the roof. India is one of those examples. This is Indian growth from      to     . Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second. Actually  for the first    years  the '  s and '  s  India didn't really grow. It grew at two percent when population growth was about two and a half. If that's familiar  that's exactly what happened in sub Sahara in the '  s and the '  s. And then something happened in     . Boom  India began to explode. It wasn't a  Hindu rate of growth    democracies can't grow.  Actually India could. And if I lay sub Saharan growth on top of the Indian growth story  it's remarkably similar. Twenty years of not much growth and a trend line which is actually telling you that sub Saharan African growth is slightly better than India. And if I then lay developing Asia on top of this  I'm saying India is    years ahead of Africa  I'm saying developing Asia is    years ahead of India  I can draw out some forecasts for the next    to    years which I think are better than the ones where you're looking backwards. And that tells me this  that Africa is going to go from a    trillion economy today to a     trillion economy by     . Now that's bigger than Europe and America put together in today's money. Life expectancy is going to go up by    years. The population's going to double from one billion to two billion  so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold in the next    years. And when I present this in Africa    Nairobi  Lagos  Accra    I get one question.  Charlie  why are you so pessimistic   And you know what  Actually  I think they've got a point. Am I really saying that there can be nothing learned  yes from the positives in Asia and India  but also the negatives  Perhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made. Surely  the technologies that we're talking about here this last week  surely some of these can perhaps help Africa grow even faster  And I think here we can play a role. Because technology does let you help. You can go and download some of the great African literature from the Internet now. No  not right now  just    seconds. You can go and buy some of the great tunes. My iPod's full of them. Buy African products. Go on holiday and see for yourself the change that's happening. Invest. Perhaps hire people  give them the skills that they can take back to Africa  and their companies will grow an awful lot faster than most of ours here in the West. And then you and I can help make sure that for Africa  the   st century is their century. Thank you very much. So when I was eight years old  a new girl came to join the class  and she was so impressive  as the new girl always seems to be. She had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case  super strong on state capitals  just a great speller. And I just curdled with jealousy that year  until I hatched my devious plan. So one day I stayed a little late after school  a little too late  and I lurked in the girls' bathroom. When the coast was clear  I emerged  crept into the classroom  and took from my teacher's desk the grade book. And then I did it. I fiddled with my rival's grades  just a little  just demoted some of those A's. All of those A's.  Laughter  And I got ready to return the book to the drawer  when hang on  some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too. So  in a frenzy  I corrected everybody's marks  not imaginatively. I gave everybody a row of D's and I gave myself a row of A's  just because I was there  you know  might as well. And I am still baffled by my behavior. I don't understand where the idea came from. I don't understand why I felt so great doing it. I felt great. I don't understand why I was never caught. I mean  it should have been so blatantly obvious. I was never caught. But most of all  I am baffled by  why did it bother me so much that this little girl  this tiny little girl  was so good at spelling  Jealousy baffles me. It's so mysterious  and it's so pervasive. We know babies suffer from jealousy. We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone. We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States. And yet  I have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thrill. For that  we have to go to fiction  because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration. In fact  I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if we didn't have jealousy  would we even have literature  Well no faithless Helen  no  Odyssey.  No jealous king  no  Arabian Nights.  No Shakespeare. There goes high school reading lists  because we're losing  Sound and the Fury   we're losing  Gatsby    Sun Also Rises   we're losing  Madame Bovary    Anna K.  No jealousy  no Proust. And now  I mean  I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers to everything  but in the case of jealousy  he kind of does. This year is the centennial of his masterpiece   In Search of Lost Time   and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness  my brand  that we can hope to have.  Laughter  And we think about Proust  we think about the sentimental bits  right  We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep. We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea. We forget how harsh his vision was. We forget how pitiless he is. I mean  these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut. I don't know what cat gut is  but let's assume it's formidable. Let's look at why they go so well together  the novel and jealousy  jealousy and Proust. Is it something as obvious as that jealousy  which boils down into person  desire  impediment  is such a solid narrative foundation  I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone  because let's think about what happens when we feel jealous. When we feel jealous  we tell ourselves a story. We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives  and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible. As the teller of the tale and the audience  we know just what details to include  to dig that knife in. Right  Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists  and this is something Proust understood. In the first volume  Swann's Way  the series of books  Swann  one of the main characters  is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed  and suddenly  in the course of a few sentences  and these are Proustian sentences  so they're long as rivers  but in the course of a few sentences  he suddenly recoils and he realizes   Hang on  everything I love about this woman  somebody else would love about this woman. Everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure  maybe right about now.  And this is the story he starts to tell himself  and from then on  Proust writes that every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress  he adds to his  collection of instruments in his private torture chamber.  Now Swann and Proust  we have to admit  were notoriously jealous. You know  Proust's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him. But you don't have to be that jealous to concede that it's hard work. Right  Jealousy is exhausting. It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed. And what does jealousy like  Jealousy likes information. Jealousy likes details. Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair  the cute little pencil case. Jealousy likes photos. That's why Instagram is such a hit.  Laughter  Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy. When Swann is in his jealous throes  and suddenly he's listening at doorways and bribing his mistress' servants  he defends these behaviors. He says   You know  look  I know you think this is repugnant  but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument.  He says   They are scientific investigations with real intellectual value.  Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd  but it is  at its crux  a quest for knowledge  a quest for truth  painful truth  and actually  where Proust is concerned  the more painful the truth  the better. Grief  humiliation  loss  These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust. He says   A woman whom we need  who makes us suffer  elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us.  Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women  No. I think he's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves. And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way  Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement  Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity  Freud would write about this later. One day  Freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him. And Freud says  it's something strange about this guy  because he's not looking at what his wife is doing. Because she's blameless  everybody knows it. The poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause. But he's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing  unintentional behaviors. Is she smiling too brightly here  or did she accidentally brush up against a man there   Freud  says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife's unconscious. The novel is very good on this point. The novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy. In fact  the more intensely jealous we are  the more we become residents of fantasy. And this is why  I think  jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things. Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive. Now I'm thinking of myself at eight  I concede  but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news. A    year old Michigan woman was caught creating a fake Facebook account from which she sent vile  hideous messages to herself for a year. For a year. A year. And she was trying to frame her ex boyfriend's new girlfriend  and I have to confess when I heard this  I just reacted with admiration. Because  I mean  let's be real. What immense  if misplaced  creativity. Right  This is something from a novel. This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel. Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine. She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters. She's the author of  Strangers on a Train  and  The Talented Mr. Ripley   books that are all about how jealousy  it muddles our minds  and once we're in the sphere  in that realm of jealousy  the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant. Take Tom Ripley  her most famous character. Now  Tom Ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had  and you're under the floorboards  he's answering to your name  he's wearing your rings  emptying your bank account. That's one way to go. But what do we do  We can't go the Tom Ripley route. I can't give the world D's  as much as I would really like to  some days. And it's a pity  because we live in envious times. We live in jealous times. I mean  we're all good citizens of social media  aren't we  where the currency is envy  Does the novel show us a way out  I'm not sure. So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure  when they are in possession of a mystery. Let's go to    B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes. When people think of Holmes  they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty  right  this criminal mastermind. But I've always preferred  Inspector  Lestrade  who is the rat faced head of Scotland Yard who needs Holmes desperately  needs Holmes' genius  but resents him. Oh  it's so familiar to me. So Lestrade needs his help  resents him  and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries. But as they work together  something starts to change  and finally in  The Adventure of the Six Napoleons   once Holmes comes in  dazzles everybody with his solution  Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says   We're not jealous of you  Mr. Holmes. We're proud of you.  And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand. It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved in the mysteries  and I find it very moving  this little scene  but it's also mysterious  right  It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry  not emotion. You know  one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade. The next minute they're on the same side. Suddenly  Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented. Could it be so simple though  What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry  just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another  Well  maybe then we wouldn't have to resent somebody's excellence. We could align ourselves with it. But I like contingency plans. So while we wait for that to happen  let us remember that we have fiction for consolation. Fiction alone demystifies jealousy. Fiction alone domesticates it  invites it to the table. And look who it gathers  sweet Lestrade  terrifying Tom Ripley  crazy Swann  Marcel Proust himself. We are in excellent company. Thank you. So last year  on the Fourth of July  experiments at the Large Hadron Collider discovered the Higgs boson. It was a historical day. There's no doubt that from now on  the Fourth of July will be remembered not as the day of the Declaration of Independence  but as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson. Well  at least  here at CERN. But for me  the biggest surprise of that day was that there was no big surprise. In the eye of a theoretical physicist  the Higgs boson is a clever explanation of how some elementary particles gain mass  but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory and incomplete solution. Too many questions are left unanswered. The Higgs boson does not share the beauty  the symmetry  the elegance  of the rest of the elementary particle world. For this reason  the majority of theoretical physicists believe that the Higgs boson could not be the full story. We were expecting new particles and new phenomena accompanying the Higgs boson. Instead  so far  the measurements coming from the LHC show no signs of new particles or unexpected phenomena. Of course  the verdict is not definitive. In       the LHC will almost double the energy of the colliding protons  and these more powerful collisions will allow us to explore further the particle world  and we will certainly learn much more. But for the moment  since we have found no evidence for new phenomena  let us suppose that the particles that we know today  including the Higgs boson  are the only elementary particles in nature  even at energies much larger than what we have explored so far. Let's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us. We will find a surprising and intriguing result about our universe  and to explain my point  let me first tell you what the Higgs is about  and to do so  we have to go back to one tenth of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang. And according to the Higgs theory  at that instant  a dramatic event took place in the universe. Space time underwent a phase transition. It was something very similar to the phase transition that occurs when water turns into ice below zero degrees. But in our case  the phase transition is not a change in the way the molecules are arranged inside the material  but is about a change of the very fabric of space time. During this phase transition  empty space became filled with a substance that we now call Higgs field. And this substance may seem invisible to us  but it has a physical reality. It surrounds us all the time  just like the air we breathe in this room. And some elementary particles interact with this substance  gaining energy in the process. And this intrinsic energy is what we call the mass of a particle  and by discovering the Higgs boson  the LHC has conclusively proved that this substance is real  because it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of. And this  in a nutshell  is the essence of the Higgs story. But this story is far more interesting than that. By studying the Higgs theory  theoretical physicists discovered  not through an experiment but with the power of mathematics  that the Higgs field does not necessarily exist only in the form that we observe today. Just like matter can exist as liquid or solid  so the Higgs field  the substance that fills all space time  could exist in two states. Besides the known Higgs state  there could be a second state in which the Higgs field is billions and billions times denser than what we observe today  and the mere existence of another state of the Higgs field poses a potential problem. This is because  according to the laws of quantum mechanics  it is possible to have transitions between two states  even in the presence of an energy barrier separating the two states  and the phenomenon is called  quite appropriately  quantum tunneling. Because of quantum tunneling  I could disappear from this room and reappear in the next room  practically penetrating the wall. But don't expect me to actually perform the trick in front of your eyes  because the probability for me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small. You would have to wait a really long time before it happens  but believe me  quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon  and it has been observed in many systems. For instance  the tunnel diode  a component used in electronics  works thanks to the wonders of quantum tunneling. But let's go back to the Higgs field. If the ultra dense Higgs state existed  then  because of quantum tunneling  a bubble of this state could suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at a certain time  and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water. Bubbles of vapor form inside the water  then they expand  turning liquid into gas. In the same way  a bubble of the ultra dense Higgs state could come into existence because of quantum tunneling. The bubble would then expand at the speed of light  invading all space  and turning the Higgs field from the familiar state into a new state. Is this a problem  Yes  it's a big a problem. We may not realize it in ordinary life  but the intensity of the Higgs field is critical for the structure of matter. If the Higgs field were only a few times more intense  we would see atoms shrinking  neutrons decaying inside atomic nuclei  nuclei disintegrating  and hydrogen would be the only possible chemical element in the universe. And the Higgs field  in the ultra dense Higgs state  is not just a few times more intense than today  but billions of times  and if space time were filled by this Higgs state  all atomic matter would collapse. No molecular structures would be possible  no life. So  I wonder  is it possible that in the future  the Higgs field will undergo a phase transition and  through quantum tunneling  will be transformed into this nasty  ultra dense state  In other words  I ask myself  what is the fate of the Higgs field in our universe  And the crucial ingredient necessary to answer this question is the Higgs boson mass. And experiments at the LHC found that the mass of the Higgs boson is about     GeV. This is tiny when expressed in familiar units  because it's equal to something like    to the minus    grams  but it is large in particle physics units  because it is equal to the weight of an entire molecule of a DNA constituent. So armed with this information from the LHC  together with some colleagues here at CERN  we computed the probability that our universe could quantum tunnel into the ultra dense Higgs state  and we found a very intriguing result. Our calculations showed that the measured value of the Higgs boson mass is very special. It has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation. The Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration that has lasted so far but that will eventually collapse. So according to these calculations  we are like campers who accidentally set their tent at the edge of a cliff. And eventually  the Higgs field will undergo a phase transition and matter will collapse into itself. So is this how humanity is going to disappear  I don't think so. Our calculation shows that quantum tunneling of the Higgs field is not likely to occur in the next    to the     years  and this is a very long time. It's even longer than the time it takes for Italy to form a stable government. Even so  we will be long gone by then. In about five billion years  our sun will become a red giant  as large as the Earth's orbit  and our Earth will be kaput  and in a thousand billion years  if dark energy keeps on fueling space expansion at the present rate  you will not even be able to see as far as your toes  because everything around you expands at a rate faster than the speed of light. So it is really unlikely that we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse. But the reason why I am interested in the transition of the Higgs field is because I want to address the question  why is the Higgs boson mass so special  Why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition  Theoretical physicists always ask  why  questions. More than how a phenomenon works  theoretical physicists are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works. We think that this these  why  questions can give us clues about the fundamental principles of nature. And indeed  a possible answer to my question opens up new universes  literally. It has been speculated that our universe is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse made out of a multitude of bubbles  and each bubble is a different universe with different fundamental constants and different physical laws. And in this context  you can only talk about the probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass. Then the key to the mystery could lie in the statistical properties of the multiverse. It would be something like what happens with sand dunes on a beach. In principle  you could imagine to find sand dunes of any slope angle in a beach  and yet  the slope angles of sand dunes are typically around        degrees. And the reason is simple  because wind builds up the sand  gravity makes it fall. As a result  the vast majority of sand dunes have slope angles around the critical value  near to collapse. And something similar could happen for the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse. In the majority of bubble universes  the Higgs mass could be around the critical value  near to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field  because of two competing effects  just as in the case of sand. My story does not have an end  because we still don't know the end of the story. This is science in progress  and to solve the mystery  we need more data  and hopefully  the LHC will soon add new clues to this story. Just one number  the Higgs boson mass  and yet  out of this number we learn so much. I started from a hypothesis  that the known particles are all there is in the universe  even beyond the domain explored so far. From this  we discovered that the Higgs field that permeates space time may be standing on a knife edge  ready for cosmic collapse  and we discovered that this may be a hint that our universe is only a grain of sand in a giant beach  the multiverse. But I don't know if my hypothesis is right. That's how physics works  A single measurement can put us on the road to a new understanding of the universe or it can send us down a blind alley. But whichever it turns out to be  there is one thing I'm sure of  The journey will be full of surprises. Thank you. My work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions. Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this. Both projects are in emerging countries  one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia. And also they have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture. The first example started with an invitation to design a multistory shopping mall in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa. And this is the type of building we were shown as an example  to my team and myself  of what we had to design. At first  the first thing I thought was  I want to run away. After seeing a few of these buildings    there are many in the city    we realized that they have three very big points. First  these buildings  they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things. Second  they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside  and then you need a lot of cooling. In a city where this shouldn't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from    to    degrees the whole year. And third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia. It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions. Also during our first visit to Ethiopia  I was really captivated by the old merkato that is this open air structure where thousands of people  they go and buy things every day from small vendors. And also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity. So I thought  this is what I really want to design  not a shopping mall. But the question was how we could do a multistory  contemporary building with these principles. The next challenge was when we looked at the site  that is  in a really growing area of the city  where most of these buildings that you see in the image  they were not there. And it's also between two parallel streets that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters. So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets  putting all the entrances of the building. And this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open air space in the building that self protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain. And around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops  that change in each floor because of the shape of the void. I also thought  how to close the building  And I really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions. And I started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in  and also the light  but in a filtered way. And then the inspiration came from these beautiful  patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses. That they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade. And we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building. And this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night. With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like   This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that.  But then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell. And also that the idea of the facade was much  much cheaper  not only because of the material compared with the glass  but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore. So we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project. And the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day. So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof. And then under those panels we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban oasis. And these porches on the roof  all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside. Hopefully by the beginning of next year  because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction. The second example is a master plan of       apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis. And for doing such a big project  the biggest project I've ever designed  I really needed to understand the city of Tunis  but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture. During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina that is this       year old structure that used to be closed by a wall  opened by twelve different gates  connected by almost straight lines. When I went to the site  the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets  creating    initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these courtyards. On top of that  we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines  and this modified this initial pattern. And the last operation was to think about the cell  the small cell of the project  like the apartment  as an essential part of the master plan. And for that I thought  what would be the best orientation in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment  And it's north south  because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation. So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction. And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city. It has these blocks with courtyards  and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians. And also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor. And it also reinforces this idea of the gates. The volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood And in the courtyards there are the different facilities  such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by  a series of commercial  spaces  that bring activity to the ground floor. The roof  which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction. And it's where all the neighbors  they can go up and socialize  and do activities such as having a two kilometer run in the morning  jumping from one building to another. These two examples  they have a common approach in the design process. And also  they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing. In these cities  the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow. For this reason  I see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people. Thank you very much. Have you ever asked yourselves why it is that companies  the really cool companies  the innovative ones  the creative  new economy type companies    Apple  Google  Facebook    are coming out of one particular country  the United States of America  Usually when I say this  someone says   Spotify  That's Europe.  But  yeah. It has not had the impact that these other companies have had. Now what I do is I'm an economist  and I actually study the relationship between innovation and economic growth at the level of the company  the industry and the nation  and I work with policymakers worldwide  especially in the European Commission  but recently also in interesting places like China  and I can tell you that that question is on the tip of all of their tongues  Where are the European Googles  What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model  which they understand is different from this old economy growth model  And what is interesting is that often  even if we're in the   st century  we kind of come down in the end to these ideas of market versus state. It's talked about in these modern ways  but the idea is that somehow  behind places like Silicon Valley  the secret have been different types of market making mechanisms  the private initiative  whether this be about a dynamic venture capital sector that's actually able to provide that high risk finance to these innovative companies  the gazelles as we often call them  which traditional banks are scared of  or different types of really successful commercialization policies which actually allow these companies to bring these great inventions  their products  to the market and actually get over this really scary Death Valley period in which many companies instead fail. But what really interests me  especially nowadays and because of what's happening politically around the world  is the language that's used  the narrative  the discourse  the images  the actual words. So we often are presented with the kind of words like that the private sector is also much more innovative because it's able to think out of the box. They are more dynamic. Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech to the      graduating class at Stanford  where he said to be innovative  you've got to stay hungry  stay foolish. Right  So these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys  right  And in places like Europe  it might be more equitable  we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the U.S.  but the problem is this damn public sector. It's a bit too big  and it hasn't actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could. And even really respectable newspapers  some that I'm actually subscribed to  the words they use are  you know  the state as this Leviathan. Right  This monster with big tentacles. They're very explicit in these editorials. They say   You know  the state  it's necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution  but you know what  what is the next big revolution going to be after the Internet  We all hope it might be something green  or all of this nanotech stuff  and in order for that stuff to happen   they say    this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution    they say   the state  just stick to the basics  right  Fund the infrastructure. Fund the schools. Even fund the basic research  because this is popularly recognized  in fact  as a big public good which private companies don't want to invest in  do that  but you know what  Leave the rest to the revolutionaries.  Those colorful  out of the box kind of thinkers. They're often called garage tinkerers  because some of them actually did some things in garages  even though that's partly a myth. And so what I want to do with you in  oh God  only    minutes  is to really think again this juxtaposition  because it actually has massive  massive implications beyond innovation policy  which just happens to be the area that I often talk with with policymakers. It has huge implications  even with this whole notion that we have on where  when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending and different types of public services which  of course  as we know  are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition. Right  I mean  the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum  or something. So these kind of words are constantly  these juxtapositions come up everywhere  not just with innovation policy. And so to think again  there's no reason that you should believe me  so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on  but you might want to take it out  your iPhone. Ask who actually funded the really cool  revolutionary thinking out of the box things in the iPhone. What actually makes your phone a smartphone  basically  instead of a stupid phone  So the Internet  which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world  GPS  where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world  the touchscreen display  which makes it also a really easy to use phone for anybody. These are the very smart  revolutionary bits about the iPhone  and they're all government funded. And the point is that the Internet was funded by DARPA  U.S. Department of Defense. GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program. Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA. The touchscreen display was funded by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware. Now  you might be thinking   Well  she's just said the word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot   but what's really interesting is that this is actually true in sector after sector and department after department. So the pharmaceutical industry  which I am personally very interested in because I've actually had the fortune to study it in quite some depth  is wonderful to be asking this question about the revolutionary versus non revolutionary bits  because each and every medicine can actually be divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental. So the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs  whereas the slight variations of existing drugs    Viagra  different color  different dosage    are the less revolutionary ones. And it turns out that a full    percent of the new molecular entities with priority rating are actually funded in boring  Kafka ian public sector labs. This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation. They do. They spend on the marketing part. They spend on the D part of R D. They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock  which is quite problematic. In fact  companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently have spent more money in buying back their shares to boost their stock price than on R D  but that's a whole different TED Talk which one day I'd be fascinated to tell you about. Now  what's interesting in all of this is the state  in all these examples  was doing so much more than just fixing market failures. It was actually shaping and creating markets. It was funding not only the basic research  which again is a typical public good  but even the applied research. It was even  God forbid  being a venture capitalist. So these SBIR and SDTR programs  which give small companies early stage finance have not only been extremely important compared to private venture capital  but also have become increasingly important. Why  Because  as many of us know  V.C. is actually quite short term. They want their returns in three to five years. Innovation takes a much longer time than that     to    years. And so this whole notion    I mean  this is the point  right  Who's actually funding the hard stuff  Of course  it's not just the state. The private sector does a lot. But the narrative that we've always been told is the state is important for the basics  but not really providing that sort of high risk  revolutionary thinking out of the box. In all these sectors  from funding the Internet to doing the spending  but also the envisioning  the strategic vision  for these investments  it was actually coming within the state. The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating to study this  because the word itself  nanotechnology  came from within government. And so there's huge implications of this. First of all  of course I'm not someone  this old fashioned person  market versus state. What we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public private partnerships. But the point is  by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually    pffff    a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan  I think we've actually really stunted the possibility to build these public private partnerships in a really dynamic way. Even the words that we often use to justify the  P  part  the public part    well  they're both P's    with public private partnerships is in terms of de risking. What the public sector did in all these examples I just gave you  and there's many more  which myself and other colleagues have been looking at  is doing much more than de risking. It's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on. It's actually been the one thinking out of the box. But also  I'm sure you all have had experience with local  regional  national governments  and you're kind of like   You know what  that Kafka ian bureaucrat  I've met him.  That whole juxtaposition thing  it's kind of there. Well  there's a self fulfilling prophecy. By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant  boring  it's sometimes that we actually create those organizations in that way. So what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations. DARPA  that funded the Internet and Siri  actually thought really hard about this  how to welcome failure  because you will fail. You will fail when you innovative. One out of    experiments has any success. And the V.C. guys know this  and they're able to actually fund the other losses from that one success. And this brings me  actually  probably  to the biggest implication  and this has huge implications beyond innovation. If the state is more than just a market fixer  if it actually is a market shaper  and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk  what happened to the reward  We all know  if you've ever taken a finance course  the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk reward relationship  and so some people are foolish enough or probably smart enough if they have time to wait  to actually invest in stocks  because they're higher risk which over time will make a greater reward than bonds  that whole risk reward thing. Well  where's the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet  The Internet was crazy. It really was. I mean  the probability of failure was massive. You had to be completely nuts to do it  and luckily  they were. Now  we don't even get to this question about rewards unless you actually depict the state as this risk taker. And the problem is that economists often think  well  there is a reward back to the state. It's tax. You know  the companies will pay tax  the jobs they create will create growth so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise will come back to the state through the tax mechanism. Well  unfortunately  that's not true. Okay  it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad. Globalization  and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic. Let the jobs go where they have to go  perhaps. I mean  one can take a position on that. But also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state    Apple's a great example. They even got the first    well  not the first  but         dollars actually went to Apple  the company  through this SBIC program  which predated the SBIR program  as well as  as I said before  all the technologies behind the iPhone. And yet we know they legally  as many other companies  pay very little tax back. So what we really need to actually rethink is should there perhaps be a return generating mechanism that's much more direct than tax. Why not  It could happen perhaps through equity. This  by the way  in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically  countries like Finland in Scandinavia  but also in China and Brazil  they're retaining equity in these investments. Sitra funded Nokia  kept equity  made a lot of money  it's a public funding agency in Finland  which then funded the next round of Nokias. The Brazilian Development Bank  which is providing huge amounts of funds today to clean technology  they just announced a     billion program for the future on this  is retaining equity in these investments. So to put it provocatively  had the U.S. government thought about this  and maybe just brought back just something called an innovation fund  you can bet that  you know  if even just .   percent of the profits from what the Internet produced had come back to that innovation fund  there would be so much more money to spend today on green technology. Instead  many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained. But perhaps even more important  we heard before about the one percent  the    percent. If the state is thought about in this more strategic way  as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism  because that's what we're talking about  right  Who are the different players in creating value in the economy  and is the state's role  has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player  If we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back  it might just be that in the next round  and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green  that that period of growth will not only be smart  innovation led  not only green  but also more inclusive  so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley can actually also benefit from that growth  because they have not. Thank you. I'm going to start by asking you a question  Is anyone familiar with the blue algae problem  Okay  so most of you are. I think we can all agree it's a serious issue. Nobody wants to drink blue algae contaminated water  or swim in a blue algae infested lake. Right  I hope you won't be disappointed  but today  I won't be talking about blue algae. Instead  I'll be talking about the main cause at the root of this issue  which I will be referring to as the phosphorus crisis. Why have I chosen to talk to you about the phosphorus crisis today  For the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it. And by the end of my presentation  I hope that the general public will be more aware of this crisis and this issue. Now  the problem is that if I ask  why do we find ourselves in this situation with blue algae  The answer is that it comes from how we farm. We use fertilizers in our farming  chemical fertilizers. Why do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture  Basically  to help plants grow and to produce a better yield. The issue is that this is set to engender an environmental problem that is without precedent. Before going further  let me give you a crash course in plant biology. So  what does a plant need in order to grow  A plant  quite simply  needs light  it needs CO   but even more importantly  it needs nutrients  which it draws from the soil. Several of these nutrients are essential chemical elements  phosphorus  nitrogen and calcium. So  the plant s roots will extract these resources. Today I'll be focusing on a major problem that is linked to phosphorus. Why phosphorus in particular  Because it is the most problematic chemical element. By the end of my presentation  you will have seen what these problems are  and where we are today. Phosphorus is a chemical element that is essential to life. This is a very important point. I d like everyone to understand precisely what the phosphorus issue is. Phosphorus is a key component in several molecules  in many of our molecules of life. Experts in the field will know that cellular communication is phosphorus based    phosphorylation  dephosphorylation. Cell membranes are phosphorus based  These are called phospholipids. The energy in all living things  ATP  is phosphorus based. And more importantly still  phosphorus is a key component of DNA  something everyone is familiar with  and which is shown in this image. DNA is our genetic heritage. It is extremely important  and once again  phosphorus is a key player. Now  where do we find this phosphorus  As humans  where do we find it  As I explained earlier  plants extract phosphorus from the soil  through water. So  we humans get it from the things we eat  plants  vegetables  fruits  and also from eggs  meat and milk. It s true that some humans eat better than others. Some are happier than others. And now  looking at this picture  which speaks for itself  we see modern agriculture  which I also refer to as intensive agriculture. Intensive agriculture is based on the use of chemical fertilizers. Without them  we would not manage to produce enough to feed the world's population. Speaking of humans  there are currently   billion of us on Earth. In less than    years  there will be   billion of us. And the question is a simple one  Do we have enough phosphorus to feed our future generations  So  in order to understand these issues  where do we find our phosphorus  Let me explain. But first  let s just suppose that we are using     percent of a given dose of phosphorus. Only    percent of this     percent goes to the plant. Eighty five percent is lost. It goes into the soil  ending its journey in the lakes  resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus  which leads to the blue algae problem. So  you ll see there s a problem here  something that is illogical. A hundred percent of the phosphorus is used  but only    percent goes to the plant. You re going to tell me it s wasteful. Yes  it is. What is worse is that it is very expensive. Nobody wants to throw their money out the window  but unfortunately that's what is happening here. Eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost. Modern agriculture depends on phosphorus. And because in order to get    percent of it to the plant  all the rest is lost  we have to add more and more. Now  where will we get this phosphorus from  Basically  we get it out of mines. This is the cover of an extraordinary article published in Nature in       which really launched the discussion about the phosphorus crisis. Phosphorus  a nutrient essential to life  which is becoming increasingly scarce  yet nobody is talking about it. And everyone agrees  Politicians and scientists are in agreement that we are headed for a phosphorus crisis. What you are seeing here is an open pit mine in the U.S.  and to give you an idea of the dimensions of this mine  if you look in the top right hand corner  the little crane you can see  that is a giant crane. So that really puts it into perspective. So  we get phosphorus from mines. And if I make a comparison with oil  there s an oil crisis  we talk about it  we talk about global warming  yet we never mention the phosphorus crisis. To come back to the oil problem  oil is something we can replace. We can use biofuels  or solar power  or hydropower  but phosphorus is an essential element  indispensable to life  and we can t replace it. What is the current state of the world's phosphorus reserves  This graph gives you a rough idea of where we are today. The black line represents predictions for phosphorus reserves. In       we ll reach the peak. By the end of this century  it will all be gone. The dotted line shows where we are today. As you can see  they meet in       I ll be retired by then. But we are indeed heading for a major crisis  and I d like people to become aware of this problem. Do we have a solution  What are we to do  We are faced with a paradox. Less and less phosphorus will be available. By      there will be   billion of us  and according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization  we will need to produce twice as much food in      than we do today. So  we will have less phosphorus  but we'll need to produce more food. What should we do  It truly is a paradoxical situation. Do we have a solution  or an alternative which will allow us to optimize phosphorus use  Remember that    percent is destined to be lost. The solution I'm offering today is one that has existed for a very long time  even before plants existed on Earth  and it's a microscopic mushroom that is very mysterious  very simple  and yet also extremely complex. I've been fascinated by this little mushroom for over    years now. It has led me to further my research and to use it as a model for my laboratory research. This mushroom exists in symbiosis with the roots. By symbiosis  I mean a bidirectional and mutually beneficial association which is also called mycorrhiza. This slide illustrates the elements of a mycorrhiza. You re looking at the root of wheat  one of the world s most important plants. Normally  a root will find phosphorus all by itself. It will go in search of phosphorus  but only within the one millimeter which surrounds it. Beyond one millimeter  the root is ineffective. It cannot go further in its search for phosphorus. Now  imagine this tiny  microscopic mushroom. It grows much faster  and is much better designed to seek out phosphorus. It can go beyond the root s one millimeter scope to seek out phosphorus. I haven t invented anything at all  it's a biotechnology that has existed for     million years. And over time  this mushroom has evolved and adapted to seek out even the tiniest trace of phosphorus  and to put it to use  to make it available to the plant. What you re seeing here  in the real world  is a carrot root  and the mushroom with its very fine filaments. Looking closer  we can see that this mushroom is very gentle in its penetration. It will proliferate between the root's cells  eventually penetrating a cell and starting to form a typical arbuscular structure  which will considerably increase the exchange interface between the plant and the mushroom. And it is through this structure that mutual exchanges will occur. It s a win win trade  I give you phosphorus  and you feed me. True symbiosis. Now let's add a mycorrhiza plant into the diagram I used earlier. And instead of using a     percent dose  I m going to reduce it to    percent. You ll see that of this    percent  most will benefit the plant  more than    percent. A very small amount of phosphorus will remain in the soil. That's completely natural. What's more is that in certain cases  we don't even need to add phosphorus. If you recall the graphs I showed you earlier     percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil  and the plants are unable to access it. Even though it is present in the soil  it is in insoluble form. The plant is only able to seek out soluble forms. The mushroom is capable of dissolving this insoluble form and making it available for the plant to use. To further support my argument  here is a picture that speaks for itself. These are trials in a field of sorghum. On the left side  you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture  with a     percent phosphorus dose. On the other side  the dose was reduced to    percent  and just look at the yield. With only a half dose  we achieved a better yield. This is to show you that this method works. And in some cases  in Cuba  Mexico and India  the dose can be reduced to    percent  and in several other cases  there's no need to add any phosphorus at all  because the mushrooms are so well adapted to finding phosphorus and drawing it from the soil. This is an example of soy production in Canada. Mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other. And here  where blue indicates a better yield  and yellow a weaker yield. The black rectangle is the plot from which the mycorrhiza was added. In other words  as I already said  I have invented nothing. Mycorrhiza has existed for     million years  and it has even helped modern day plant species to diversify. So  this it isn't something that is still undergoing lab tests. Mycorrhiza exists  it works  it's produced at an industrial scale and commercialized worldwide. The problem is that people are not aware of it. People like food producers and farmers are still not aware of this problem. We have a technology that works  and one that  if used correctly  will alleviate some of the pressure we are putting on the world's phosphorus reserves. In conclusion  I am a scientist and a dreamer. I'm passionate about this topic. So if you were to ask me what my retirement dream is  which will be at the moment we reach that phosphorus peak  it would be that we use one label   Made with mycorrhiza   and that my children and grandchildren buy products bearing that label too. Thank you for your attention. I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy  and this little white dog called Maui was staying with me. Half the city was dark because of a power cut  and I was living on the dark side. Now  Maui was terrified of the dark  so I had to carry him up the stairs  actually down the stairs first  for his walk  and then bring him back up. I was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day. And through all of this  I had to hold a torch between my teeth. The stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread. For a shower  I walked    blocks to a branch of my gym. But these were not the major preoccupations of my day. It was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices. I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points. I wasn't the only one. Even in the rain  people stood between Madison and  th Avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street. Nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology  and yet here we were  obsessed about being wired. I think there's nothing like a crisis to tell you what's really important and what's not  and Sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter. The self as we once knew it no longer exists  and I think that an abstract  digital universe has become a part of our identity  and I want to talk to you about what I think that means. I'm a novelist  and I'm interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common. They're both stories  interpretations. You and I can experience things without a story. We might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless. But the larger sense that we have of our lives  the slightly more abstract one  is indirect. Our story of our life is based on direct experience  but it's embellished. A novel needs scene after scene to build  and the story of our life needs an arc as well. It needs months and years. Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters. But the story is not about these chapters. It's the whole book. It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness  the victories and the disappointments  but it's because how because of these  and sometimes  more importantly  in spite of these  we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves. Our story  therefore  needs two dimensions of time  a long arc of time that is our lifespan  and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment. Now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment  but the one that narrates needs several moments  a whole sequence of them  and that's why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time. Now  the flow of time is embedded in everything  in the erosion of a grain of sand  in the budding of a little bud into a rose. Without it  we would have no music. Our own emotions and state of mind often encode time  regret or nostalgia about the past  hope or dread about the future. I think that technology has altered that flow of time. The overall time that we have for our narrative  our lifespan  has been increasing  but the smallest measure  the moment  has shrunk. It has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time  and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world  and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers. All of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen. Science can do things with and in a picosecond  but you and I are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second. You and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow  to the sun  the moon and the seasons  and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past  the present and the future to see things for what they are  to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations. We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect  not just in the material world  but in our own intentions and our motivations. What happens when that arrow goes awry  What happens when time warps  So many of us today have the sensation that time's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once. This is because time doesn't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one. We all know that the Internet has shrunk space as well as time. Far away over there is now here. News from India is a stream on my smartphone app whether I'm in New York or New Delhi. And that's not all. Your last job  your dinner reservations from last year  your former friends  lie on a flat plain with today's friends  because the Internet also archives  and it warps the past. With no distinction left between the past  the present and the future  and the here or there  we are left with this moment everywhere  this moment that I'll call the digital now. Just how can we prioritize in the landscape of the digital now  This digital now is not the present  because it's always a few seconds ahead  with Twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones. This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book. This now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state. Its focus  instead  is to distract us at every turn on the road. Every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else. Are you reading an interview by an author  Why not buy his book  Tweet it. Share it. Like it. Find other books exactly like his. Find other people reading those books. Travel can be liberating  but when it is incessant  we become permanent exiles without repose. Choice is freedom  but not when it's constantly for its own sake. Not just is the digital now far from the present  but it's in direct competition with it  and this is because not just am I absent from it  but so are you. Not just are we absent from it  but so is everyone else. And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror. I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night  shop for Parisian macarons  and leave video messages that get picked up later. At all times  I can operate at a different rhythm and pace from you  while I sustain the illusion that I'm tapped into you in real time. Sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter. There were those with power and water  and those without. There are those who went back to their lives  and those who are still displaced after so many months. For some reason  technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does  and then  like an ironic slap in the face  it makes it true. For example  it's said that there are more people in India with access to cell phones than toilets. Now if this rift  which is already so great in many parts of the world  between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology  isn't somehow bridged  there will be ruptures between the digital and the real. For us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it  the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous. How does one live inside distraction  We might think that those younger than us  those who are born into this  will adapt more naturally. Possibly  but I remember my childhood. I remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me. Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube  and Vienna had a Spanish riding school. If I were a child today  I could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks  but it really wouldn't be the same  because much later  I went to Vienna  and I went to the Spanish riding school  and I could feel my grandfather right beside me. Night after night  he took me up on the terrace  on his shoulders  and pointed out Jupiter and Saturn and the Great Bear to me. And even here  when I look at the Great Bear  I get back that feeling of being a child  hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder  and I can get back that feeling of being a child again. What I had with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact  but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact. Time warping technology challenges our deepest core  because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget  even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable. We want to clutch  and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments. They're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them. By archiving everything  we think that we can store it  but time is not data. It cannot be stored. You and I know exactly what it means like to be truly present in a moment. It might have happened while we were playing an instrument  or looking into the eyes of someone we've known for a very long time. At such moments  our selves are complete. The self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one. The present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future. The present joins a flow of time from before and after. I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother. I wanted to learn to skip  and she found an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it. I wanted to learn to cook  and she kept me in the kitchen  cutting  cubing and chopping for a whole month. My grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take  that time can't be fought  and because it will pass and it will move  we owe the present moment our full attention. Attention is time. One of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention  and definitely from my grandmother  love and attention were one and the same thing. The digital world cannibalizes time  and in doing so  I want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves. It threatens the flow of love. But we don't need to let it. We can choose otherwise. We've seen again and again just how creative technology can be  and in our lives and in our actions  we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it. We can slow down and we can tune in to the ebb and flow of time. We can choose to take time back. Thank you. Three years ago  I was standing about a hundred yards from Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four. My Geiger counter dosimeter  which measures radiation  was going berserk  and the closer I got  the more frenetic it became  and frantic. My God. I was there covering the   th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident  as you can see by the look on my face  reluctantly so  but with good reason  because the nuclear fire that burned for    days back in      released     times as much radiation as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima  and the sarcophagus  which is the covering over reactor number four  which was hastily built    years ago  now sits cracked and rusted and leaking radiation. So I was filming. I just wanted to get the job done and get out of there fast. But then  I looked into the distance  and I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse  and I'm thinking  who could be living here  I mean  after all  Chernobyl's soil  water and air  are among the most highly contaminated on Earth  and the reactor sits at the the center of a tightly regulated exclusion zone  or dead zone  and it's a nuclear police state  complete with border guards. You have to have dosimeter at all times  clicking away  you have to have a government minder  and there's draconian radiation rules and constant contamination monitoring. The point being  no human being should be living anywhere near the dead zone. But they are. It turns out an unlikely community of some     people are living inside the zone. They're called self settlers. And almost all of them are women  the men having shorter lifespans in part due to overuse of alcohol  cigarettes  if not radiation. Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated at the time of the accident  but not everybody accepted that fate. The women in the zone  now in their   s and   s  are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities and  it would seem  common sense  and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone. They did so illegally. As one woman put it to a soldier who was trying to evacuate her for a second time   Shoot me and dig the grave. Otherwise  I'm going home.  Now why would they return to such deadly soil  I mean  were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them  or both  The thing is  they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently. Now around Chernobyl  there are scattered ghost villages  eerily silent  strangely charming  bucolic  totally contaminated. Many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident  but a few are left like this  kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy. Others have a few residents in them  one or two  babushkas   or  babas   which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother. Another village might have six or seven residents. So this is the strange demographic of the zone    isolated alone together. And when I made my way to that piping chimney I'd seen in the distance  I saw Hanna Zavorotnya  and I met her. She's the self declared mayor of Kapavati village  population eight. And she said to me  when I asked her the obvious   Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does.  And you have to remember  these women have survived the worst atrocities of the   th century. Stalin's enforced famines of the     s  the Holodomor  killed millions of Ukrainians  and they faced the Nazis in the '  s  who came through slashing  burning  raping  and in fact many of these women were shipped to Germany as forced labor. So when a couple decades into Soviet rule  Chernobyl happened  they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy that was invisible. So they returned to their villages and are told they're going to get sick and die soon  but five happy years  their logic goes  is better than    stuck in a high rise on the outskirts of Kiev  separated from the graves of their mothers and fathers and babies  the whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon. For them  environmental contamination may not be the worst sort of devastation. It turns out this holds true for other species as well. Wild boar  lynx  moose  they've all returned to the region in force  the very real  very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans. The dead zone  it turns out  is full of life. And there is a kind of heroic resilience  a kind of plain spoken pragmatism to those who start their day at   a.m. pulling water from a well and end it at midnight poised to beat a bucket with a stick and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes  their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka. And there's a patina of simple defiance among them.  They told us our legs would hurt  and they do. So what   I mean  what about their health  The benefits of hardy  physical living  but an environment made toxic by a complicated  little understood enemy  radiation. It's incredibly difficult to parse. Health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught. The World Health Organization puts the number of Chernobyl related deaths at        eventually. Greenpeace and other organizations put that number in the tens of thousands. Now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers are sky high  and that Chernobyl evacuees suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere  higher levels of anxiety  depression  alcoholism  unemployment and  importantly  disrupted social networks. Now  like many of you  I have moved maybe        times in my life. Home is a transient concept. I have a deeper connection to my laptop than any bit of soil. So it's hard for us to understand  but home is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka  and connection to the land is palpable. And perhaps because these Ukrainian women were schooled under the Soviets and versed in the Russian poets  aphorisms about these ideas slip from their mouths all the time.  If you leave  you die.   Those who left are worse off now. They are dying of sadness.   Motherland is motherland. I will never leave.  What sounds like faith  soft faith  may actually be fact  because the surprising truth    I mean  there are no studies  but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on Earth for the last    years  have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation  by some estimates up to    years. How could this be  Here's a theory  Could it be that those ties to ancestral soil  the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms  actually affect longevity  The power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative. Home and community are forces that rival even radiation. Now radiation or not  these women are at the end of their lives. In the next decade  the zone's human residents will be gone  and it will revert to a wild  radioactive place  full only of animals and occasionally daring  flummoxed scientists. But the spirit and existence of the babushkas  whose numbers have been halved in the three years I've known them  will leave us with powerful new templates to think about and grapple with  about the relative nature of risk  about transformative connections to home  and about the magnificent tonic of personal agency and self determination. Thank you. It is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence  and I believe this is true  especially when I hear President Obama often talk about the Korean education system as a benchmark of success. Well  I can tell you that  in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the Korean school system  also known as pressure cooker  not everyone can do well in that environment. While many people responded in different ways about our education system  my response to the high pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building. Why bows  I'm not quite sure. Perhaps  in the face of constant pressure  my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows. If you think about it  the bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times. The area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the Joseon dynasty  where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves. In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact  the government has planted mulberry trees. The seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the      Olympics. The area near these walls  which nobody bothers to pay attention to  had been left free from major intervention  and this is where I first found my treasures. As I fell deeper into bow making  I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood. When I went on school field trips  family vacations  or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes  I wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag. And they would be somethings like saws  knives  sickles and axes that I covered up with a piece of towel. I would bring the branches home  riding buses and subways  barely holding them in my hands. And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach. Airport security. In the privacy of my room  covered in sawdust  I would saw  trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape. One day  I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place on fire. Where  The rooftop of my apartment building  a place where    families call home. A customer from a department store across from my building called      and I ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned. I want to take this opportunity to tell my mom  in the audience today  Mom  I was really sorry  and I will be more careful with open fire from now on. My mother had to do a lot of explaining  telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson. I also researched extensively on bows around the world. In that process  I tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow. I also worked with many different types of wood  such as maple  yew and mulberry  and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that I mentioned before. The most effective bow for me would be like this. One  Curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw and shoot the arrow. Two  Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight  which means more power. Three  Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage. And four  Horn used to store energy in compression. After fixing  breaking  redesigning  mending  bending and amending  my ideal bow began to take shape  and when it was finally done  it looked like this. I was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own. This is a picture of Korean traditional bows taken from a museum  and see how my bow resembles them. Thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention.  Laughter  Through bowmaking  I came in contact with part of my heritage. Learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me. You see  I searched far and wide  but never bothered to look close and near. From this realization  I began to take interest in Korean history  which had never inspired me before. In the end  the grass is often greener on my side of the fence  although we don't realize it. Now  I am going to show you how my bow works. And let's see how this one works. This is a bamboo bow  with    pound draw weights. A bow may function in a simple mechanism  but in order to make a good bow  a great amount of sensitivity is required. You need to console and communicate with the wood material. Each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being  and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow. I may be an  odd  student with unconventional interests  but I hope I am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you. My ideal world is a place where no one is left behind  where everyone is needed exactly where they are  like the fibers and the tendons in a bow  a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is resilient. The bow resembles me  and I resemble the bow. Now  I am shooting a part of myself to you. No  better yet  a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind. Did it strike you  Thank you. In December of       the city of Apatzing n in the coastal state of Michoac n  in Mexico  awoke to gunfire. For two straight days  the city became an open battlefield between the federal forces and a well organized group  presumably from the local criminal organization  La Familia Michoacana  or the Michoac n family. The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire but also explosions and burning trucks used as barricades across the city  so truly like a battlefield. After these two days  and during a particularly intense encounter  it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana  Nazario Moreno  was killed. In response to this terrifying violence  the mayor of Apatzing n decided to call the citizens to a march for peace. The idea was to ask for a softer approach to criminal activity in the state. And so  the day of the scheduled procession  thousands of people showed up. As the mayor was preparing to deliver the speech starting the march  his team noticed that  while half of the participants were appropriately dressed in white  and bearing banners asking for peace  the other half was actually marching in support of the criminal organization and its now presumed defunct leader. Shocked  the mayor decided to step aside rather than participate or lead a procession that was ostensibly in support of organized crime. And so his team stepped aside. The two marches joined together  and they continued their path towards the state capital. This story of horrific violence followed by a fumbled approach by federal and local authorities as they tried to engage civil society  who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization  is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today  where we see that our current understanding of drug violence and what leads to it is probably at the very least incomplete. If you decided to spend    minutes trying to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico by  say  just researching online  the first thing you would find out is that while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal  there are some that are more and there are some that are much less equal than others  because you will quickly find out that in the past six years anywhere between    and         people have lost their lives in drug related violence. To put these numbers in perspective  this is eight times larger than the number of casualties in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. It's also shockingly close to the number of people who have died in the Syrian civil war  which is an active civil war. This is happening just south of the border. Now as you're reading  however  you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths  because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless  nameless dead people. Implicitly or explicitly  there is a narrative that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade  and we infer this because they were either tortured or executed in a professional manner  or  most likely  both. And so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died. And so the narrative is that somehow these people got what they were deserved. They were part of the bad guys. And that creates some form of comfort for a lot of people. However  while it's easier to think of us  the citizens  the police  the army  as the good guys  and them  the narcos  the carteles  as the bad guys  if you think about it  the latter are only providing a service to the former. Whether we like it or not  the U.S. is the largest market for illegal substances in the world  accounting for more than half of global demand. It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico that is its only route of access from the South  and so  as the former dictator of Mexico  Porfirio Diaz  used to say   Poor Mexico  so far from God and so close to the United States.  The U.N. estimates that there are    million users of illegal drugs in the United States. Using very  very conservative assumptions  this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side of anywhere between    and     billion dollars. If we assume that the narcos only have access to the wholesale part  which we know is false  that still leaves you with yearly revenues of anywhere between    billion and    billion dollars. To put these numbers in perspective  Microsoft has yearly revenues of    billion dollars. And it so happens that this is a product that  because of its nature  a business model to address this market requires you to guarantee to your producers that their product will be reliably placed in the markets where it is consumed. And the only way to do this  because it's illegal  is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs. Hence the violence. If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence  you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north. The only thing that the cartels are doing is that they're trying to protect their business. It's not only a multi billion dollar market  but it's also a complex one. For example  the coca plant is a fragile plant that can only grow in certain latitudes  and so it means that a business model to address this market requires you to have decentralized  international production  that by the way needs to have good quality control  because people need a good high that is not going to kill them and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it. And so that means they need to secure production and quality control in the south  and you need to ensure that you have efficient and effective distribution channels in the markets where these drugs are consumed. I urge you  but only a little bit  because I don't want to get you in trouble  to just ask around and see how difficult it would be to get whatever drug you want  wherever you want it  whenever you want it  anywhere in the U.S.  and some of you may be surprised to know that there are many dealers that offer a service where if you send them a text message  they guarantee delivery of the drug in    minutes or less. Think about this for a second. Think about the complexity of the distribution network that I just described. It's very difficult to reconcile this with the image of faceless  ignorant goons that are just shooting each other  very difficult to reconcile. Now  as a business professor  and as any business professor would tell you  an effective organization requires an integrated strategy that includes a good organizational structure  good incentives  a solid identity and good brand management. This leads me to the second thing that you would learn in your    minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico. Because you would quickly realize  and maybe be confused by the fact  that there are three organizations that are constantly named in the articles. You will hear about Los Zetas  the Knights Templar  which is the new brand for the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning  and the Sinaloa Federation. You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter and they silence the press  and this is somewhat true  or mostly true. But this is the result of a very careful branding and business strategy. You see  Los Zetas is not just this random assortment of individuals  but was actually created by another criminal organization  the Gulf Cartel  that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico. When that corridor became contested  they decided that they wanted to recruit a professional enforcement arm. So they recruited Los Zetas  an entire unit of elite paratroopers from the Mexican Army. They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel  so much so that at some point  they decided to just take over the operations  which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets  because they grow up. Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason  they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution in the most profitable markets like cocaine  but what they did have  and this is again based on their military origin  was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy and a very clear promotion path that allowed them to supervise and operate across many  many markets very effectively  which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do. And so because they didn't have access to the more profitable drug markets  this pushed them and gave them the opportunity to diversify into other forms of crime. That includes kidnapping  prostitution  local drug dealing and human trafficking  including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S. So what they currently run is truly and quite literally a franchise business. They focus most of their recruiting on the army  and they very openly advertise for better salaries  better benefits  better promotion paths  not to mention much better food  than what the army can deliver. The way they operate is that when they arrive in a locality  they let people know that they are there  and they go to the most powerful local gang and they say   I offer you to be the local representative of the Zeta brand.  If they agree    and you don't want to know what happens if they don't    they train them and they supervise them on how to run the most efficient criminal operation for that town  in exchange for royalties. This kind of business model obviously depends entirely on having a very effective brand of fear  and so Los Zetas carefully stage acts of violence that are spectacular in nature  especially when they arrive first in a city  but again  that's just a brand strategy. I'm not saying they're not violent  but what I am saying is that even though you will read that they are the most violent of all  when you count  when you do the body count  they're actually all the same. In contrast to them  the Knights Templar that arose in Michoac n emerged in reaction to the incursion of the Zetas into the state of Michoac n. Michoac n is a geographically strategic state because it has one of the largest ports in Mexico  and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico  which then gives you direct access to the U.S. The Knights Templar realized very quickly that they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone  and so they developed a strategy as a social enterprise. They brand themselves as representative of and protecting of the citizens of Michoac n against organized crime. Their brand of social enterprise means that they require a lot of civic engagement  so they invest heavily in providing local services  like dealing with home violence  going after petty criminals  treating addicts  and keeping drugs out of the local markets where they are  and  of course  protecting people from other criminal organizations. Now  they kill a lot of people too  but when they kill them  they provide very careful narratives and descriptions for why they did them  through newspaper insertions  YouTube videos  and billboards that explain that the people who were killed were killed because they represented a threat not to us  as an organization  of course  but to you  as citizens. And so we're actually here to protect you. They  as social enterprises do  have created a moral and ethical code that they advertise around  and they have very strict recruiting practices. And here you have the types of explanations that they provide for some of their actions. They have actually retained access to the profitable drug trade  but the way they do it is  because they control all of Michoac n  and they control the Port of L zaro C rdenas  they leverage that to  for example  trade copper from Michoac n that is legally created and legally extracted with illegal ephedrine from China which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines that they produce  and then they have partnerships with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation that place their products in the U.S. Finally  the Sinaloa Federation. When you read about them  you will often read about them with an undertone of reverence and admiration  because they are the most integrated and the largest of all the Mexican organizations  and  many people argue  the world. They started as just sort of a transport organization that specialized in smuggling between the U.S. and the Mexican borders  but now they have grown into a truly integrated multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution across the planet. They have cultivated a brand of professionalism  business acumen and innovation. They have designed new drug products and new drug processes. They have designed narco tunnels that go across the border  and you can see that these are not  The Shawshank Redemption  types. They have invented narco submarines and boats that are not detected by radar. They have invented drones to transport drugs  catapults  you name it. One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation actually made it to the Forbes list.       Joaquin Guzman Loera  Like any multinational would  they have specialized and focused only in the most profitable part of the business  which is high margin drugs like cocaine  heroine  methamphetamines. Like any traditional Latin American multinational would  the way they control their operations is through family ties. When they're entering a new market  they send a family member to supervise it  or  if they're partnering with a new organization  they create a family tie  either through marriages or other types of ties. Like any other multinational would  they protect their brand by outsourcing the more questionable parts of the business model  like for example  when they have to engage in violence against other criminal organizations  they recruit gangs and other smaller players to do the dirty work for them  and they try to separate their operations and their violence and be very discrete about this. To further strengthen their brand  they actually have professional P.R. firms that shape how the press talks about them. They have professional videographers on staff. They have incredibly productive ties with the security organizations on both sides of the border. And so  differences aside  what these three organizations share is on the one hand  a very clear understanding that institutions cannot be imposed from the top  but rather they are built from the bottom up one interaction at a time. They have created extremely coherent structures that they use to show the inconsistencies in government policies. And so what I want you to remember from this talk are three things. The first one is that drug violence is actually the result of a huge market demand and an institutional setup that forces the servicing of this market to necessitate violence to guarantee delivery routes. The second thing I want you to remember is that these are sophisticated  coherent organizations that are business organizations  and analyzing them and treating them as such is probably a much more useful approach. The third thing I want you to remember is that even though we're more comfortable with this idea of  them   a set of bad guys separated from us  we are actually accomplices to them  either through our direct consumption or through our acceptance of the inconsistency between our policies of prohibition and our actual behavior of tolerance or even encouragement of consumption. These organizations service  recruit from  and operate within our communities  so necessarily  they are much more integrated within them than we are comfortable acknowledging. And so to me the question is not whether these dynamics will continue the way they have. We see that the nature of this phenomenon guarantees that they will. The question is whether we are willing to continue our support of a failed strategy based on our stubborn  blissful  voluntary ignorance at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young. Thank you. I was about    years old on a camping trip with my dad in the Adirondack Mountains  a wilderness area in the northern part of New York State. It was a beautiful day. The forest was sparkling. The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass  and if it weren't for the path we were following  we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to ever walk that land. We got to our campsite. It was a lean to on a bluff looking over a crystal  beautiful lake  when I discovered a horror. Behind the lean to was a dump  maybe    feet square with rotting apple cores and balled up aluminum foil  and a dead sneaker. And I was astonished  I was very angry  and I was deeply confused. The campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in  who did they think would clean up after them  That question stayed with me  and it simplified a little. Who cleans up after us  However you configure or wherever you place the us  who cleans up after us in Istanbul  Who cleans up after us in Rio or in Paris or in London  Here in New York  the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us  to the tune of        tons of garbage and       tons of recyclables every day. I wanted to get to know them as individuals. I wanted to understand who takes the job. What's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden  So I started a research project with them. I rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city  and I learned a lot  but I was still an outsider. I needed to go deeper. So I took the job as a sanitation worker. I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks. And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow. It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education. Everyone asks about the smell. It's there  but it's not as prevalent as you think  and on days when it is really bad  you get used to it rather quickly. The weight takes a long time to get used to. I knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week. Then there's the danger. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  sanitation work is one of the    most dangerous occupations in the country  and I learned why. You're in and out of traffic all day  and it's zooming around you. It just wants to get past you  so it's often the motorist is not paying attention. That's really bad for the worker. And then the garbage itself is full of hazards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm. I also learned about the relentlessness of trash. When you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck  you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself. It never stops coming. It's also like a form of respiration or circulation. It must always be in motion. And then there's the stigma. You put on the uniform  and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you've blocked traffic with your truck  or you're taking a break too close to their home  or you're drinking coffee in their diner  and they will come and scorn you  and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them. I find the stigma especially ironic  because I strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city  for three reasons. They are the first guardians of public health. If they're not taking away trash efficiently and effectively every day  it starts to spill out of its containments  and the dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real ways. Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us. The economy needs them. If we can't throw out the old stuff  we have no room for the new stuff  so then the engines of the economy start to sputter when consumption is compromised. I'm not advocating capitalism  I'm just pointing out their relationship. And then there's what I call our average  necessary quotidian velocity. By that I simply mean how fast we're used to moving in the contemporary day and age. We usually don't care for  repair  clean  carry around our coffee cup  our shopping bag  our bottle of water. We use them  we throw them out  we forget about them  because we know there's a workforce on the other side that's going to take it all away. So I want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanitation that will perhaps help ameliorate the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane. Their work  I think  is kind of liturgical. They're on the streets every day  rhythmically. They wear a uniform in many cities. You know when to expect them. And their work lets us do our work. They are almost a form of reassurance. The flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves  from our own dross  our cast offs  and that flow must be maintained always no matter what. On the day after September    in       I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street  and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs and there was a man doing his paper recycling route like he did every Wednesday. And I tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days  but I started to cry. And he looked at me  and he just nodded  and he said   We're going to be okay. We're going to be okay.  It was a little while later that I started my research with sanitation  and I met that man again. His name is Paulie  and we worked together many times  and we became good friends. I want to believe that Paulie was right. We are going to be okay. But in our effort to reconfigure how we as a species exist on this planet  we must include and take account of all the costs  including the very real human cost of the labor. And we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about  how do we create systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from curbside recycling  which is a remarkable success across    years  across the United States and countries around the world  and lift us up to a broader horizon where we're looking at other forms of waste that could be lessened from manufacturing and industrial sources. Municipal waste  what we think of when we talk about garbage  accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream. It's a remarkable statistic. So in the flow of your days  in the flow of your lives  next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you  take a moment to acknowledge them. Take a moment to say thank you. I am a neuroscientist with a mixed background in physics and medicine. My lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology focuses on spinal cord injury  which affects more than        people around the world every year  with dramatic consequences for affected individuals  whose life literally shatters in a matter of a handful of seconds. And for me  the Man of Steel  Christopher Reeve  has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured people. And this is how I started my own personal journey in this field of research  working with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. I still remember this decisive moment. It was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation. Chris addressed us  the scientists and experts   You have to be more pragmatic. When leaving your laboratory tomorrow  I want you to stop by the rehabilitation center to watch injured people fighting to take a step  struggling to maintain their trunk. And when you go home  think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better.  These words  they stuck with me. This was more than    years ago  but ever since  my laboratory has followed the pragmatic approach to recovery after spinal cord injury. And my first step in this direction was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury while offering well controlled experimental conditions. And for this purpose  we placed two hemisections on opposite sides of the body. They completely interrupt the communication between the brain and the spinal cord  thus leading to complete and permanent paralysis of the leg. But  as observed  after most injuries in humans  there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue through which recovery can occur. But how to make it happen  Well  the classical approach consists of applying intervention that would promote the growth of the severed fiber to the original target. And while this certainly remained the key for a cure  this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me. To reach clinical fruition rapidly  it was obvious  I had to think about the problem differently. It turned out that more than     years of research on spinal cord physiology  starting with the Nobel Prize Sherrington  had shown that the spinal cord  below most injuries  contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks to coordinate locomotion  but because input from the brain is interrupted  they are in a nonfunctional state  like kind of dormant. My idea  We awaken this network. And at the time  I was a post doctoral fellow in Los Angeles  after completing my Ph.D. in France  where independent thinking is not necessarily promoted. I was afraid to talk to my new boss  but decided to muster up my courage. I knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor  Reggie Edgerton  to share my new idea. He listened to me carefully  and responded with a grin.  Why don't you try   And I promise to you  this was such an important moment in my career  when I realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas. And this was the idea  I'm going to use a simplistic metaphor to explain to you this complicated concept. Imagine that the locomotor system is a car. The engine is the spinal cord. The transmission is interrupted. The engine is turned off. How could we re engage the engine  First  we have to provide the fuel  second  press the accelerator pedal  third  steer the car. It turned out that there are known neural pathways coming from the brain that play this very function during locomotion. My idea  Replace this missing input to provide the spinal cord with the kind of intervention that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk. For this  I leveraged    years of past research in neuroscience  first to replace the missing fuel with pharmacological agents that prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire  and second  to mimic the accelerator pedal with electrical stimulation. So here imagine an electrode implanted on the back of the spinal cord to deliver painless stimulation. It took many years  but eventually we developed an electrochemical neuroprosthesis that transformed the neural network in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state. Immediately  the paralyzed rat can stand. As soon as the treadmill belt starts moving  the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg  but without the brain. Here what I call  the spinal brain  cognitively processes sensory information arising from the moving leg and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle in order to stand  to walk  to run  and even here  while sprinting  instantly stand if the treadmill stops moving. This was amazing. I was completely fascinated by this locomotion without the brain  but at the same time so frustrated. This locomotion was completely involuntary. The animal had virtually no control over the legs. Clearly  the steering system was missing. And it then became obvious from me that we had to move away from the classical rehabilitation paradigm  stepping on a treadmill  and develop conditions that would encourage the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg. With this in mind  we developed a completely new robotic system to support the rat in any direction of space. Imagine  this is really cool. So imagine the little     gram rat attached at the extremity of this     kilo robot  but the rat does not feel the robot. The robot is transparent  just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure steps. Let me summarize  The rat received a paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord. The electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks. The robot provided the safe environment to allow the rat to attempt anything to engage the paralyzed legs. And for motivation  we used what I think is the most powerful pharmacology of Switzerland  fine Swiss chocolate. Actually  the first results were very  very  very disappointing. Here is my best physical therapist completely failing to encourage the rat to take a single step  whereas the same rat  five minutes earlier  walked beautifully on the treadmill. We were so frustrated. But you know  one of the most essential qualities of a scientist is perseverance. We insisted. We refined our paradigm  and after several months of training  the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand  and whenever she decided  initiated full weight bearing locomotion to sprint towards the rewards. This is the first recovery ever observed of voluntary leg movement after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord leading to complete and permanent paralysis. In fact    Thank you. In fact  not only could the rat initiate and sustain locomotion on the ground  they could even adjust leg movement  for example  to resist gravity in order to climb a staircase. I can promise you this was such an emotional moment in my laboratory. It took us    years of hard work to reach this goal. But the remaining question was  how  I mean  how is it possible  And here  what we found was completely unexpected. This novel training paradigm encouraged the brain to create new connections  some relay circuits that relay information from the brain past the injury and restore cortical control over the locomotor networks below the injury. And here  you can see one such example  where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red. This blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center  and what this constellation of synaptic contacts means is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center with only one relay neuron. But the remodeling was not restricted to the lesion area. It occurred throughout the central nervous system  including in the brain stem  where we observed up to     percent increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain. We did not aim to repair the spinal cord  yet we were able to promote one of the more extensive remodeling of axonal projections ever observed in the central nervous system of adult mammal after an injury. And there is a very important message hidden behind this discovery. They are the result of a young team of very talented people  physical therapists  neurobiologists  neurosurgeons  engineers of all kinds  who have achieved together what would have been impossible by single individuals. This is truly a trans disciplinary team. They are working so close to each other that there is horizontal transfer of DNA. We are creating the next generation of M.D.'s and engineers capable of translating discoveries all the way from bench to bedside. And me  I am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony. Now  I am sure you are all wondering  aren't you  will this help injured people  Me too  every day. The truth is that we don't know enough yet. This is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury  but I begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people's quality of life. I would like you all to take a moment and dream with me. Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury. After a few weeks of recovery  we will implant a programmable pump to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail directly to the spinal cord. At the same time  we will implant an electrode array  a sort of second skin covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement  and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator that delivers stimulations that are tailored to the person's needs. This defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis that will enable locomotion during training with a newly designed supporting system. And my hope is that after several months of training  there may be enough remodeling of residual connection to allow locomotion without the robot  maybe even without pharmacology or stimulation. My hope here is to be able to create the personalized condition to boost the plasticity of the brain and the spinal cord. And this is a radically new concept that may apply to other neurological disorders  what I termed  personalized neuroprosthetics   where by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces  I implanted throughout the nervous system  in the brain  in the spinal cord  even in peripheral nerves  based on patient specific impairments. But not to replace the lost function  no    to help the brain help itself. And I hope this enticed your imagination  because I can promise to you this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur  but when. And remember  we are only as great as our imagination  as big as our dream. Thank you. The two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the Internet and the mobile phone. They've changed the world. However  largely to our surprise  they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state. It turned out that the capability to collect data  information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we've been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about Western intelligence agencies  mostly U.S. intelligence agencies  watching over the rest of the world. We've heard about these starting with the revelations from June  . Edward Snowden started leaking information  top secret classified information  from the U.S. intelligence agencies  and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others. And these are examples of the kinds of programs U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now  against the whole rest of the world. And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell  well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist. We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined. And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah. Due to be opened very soon  it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center. You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting. And it's a pretty big building. How big  Well  I can give you the numbers            square meters    but that doesn't really tell you very much. Maybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison. You think about the largest IKEA store you've ever been in. This is five times larger. How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store  Right  It's pretty big. We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year. And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever  keep it for extended periods of time  keep it for years  keep it for decades. And this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all. And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone. Well  not exactly everyone  because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners. They can monitor foreigners when foreigners' data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States. And monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad until you realize that I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner. In fact     percent of the planet are foreigners. Right  So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us  all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet. But don't get me wrong  There are actually types of surveillance that are okay. I love freedom  but even I agree that some surveillance is fine. If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer  or they're trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting  and they have leads and they have suspects  then it's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect's phone  and to intercept his Internet communications. I'm not arguing that at all  but that's not what programs like PRISM are about. They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings. They're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent. So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this  well  the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations  there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations  saying that we knew all this already  we knew it was happening  there's nothing new here. And that's not true. Don't let anybody tell you that we knew this already  because we did not know this already. Our worst fears might have been something like this  but we didn't know this was happening. Now we know for a fact it's happening. We didn't know about this. We didn't know about PRISM. We didn't know about XKeyscore. We didn't know about Cybertrans. We didn't know about DoubleArrow. We did not know about Skywriter    all these different programs run by U.S. intelligence agencies. But now we do. And we did not know that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose. And what that means is that you take something which is secure  an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file  nobody can decrypt that file. Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file  it's going to take millions of years. So that's basically perfectly safe  uncrackable. You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose  making all of us less secure as an end result. A real world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because  you know  bad people might have house alarms  but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result. Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind. But of course  these intelligence agencies are doing their job. This is what they have been told to do  do signals intelligence  monitor telecommunications  monitor Internet traffic. That's what they're trying to do  and since most  a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted  they're trying to find ways around the encryption. One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms  which is a great example about how U.S. intelligence agencies are running loose. They are completely out of control  and they should be brought back under control. So what do we actually know about the leaks  Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden. The very first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers  and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to. They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers. So for example  they name the collection from Microsoft started on September           for Yahoo on the March           and then others  Google  Facebook  Skype  Apple and so on. And every single one of these companies denies. They all say that this simply isn't true  that they are not giving backdoor access to their data. Yet we have these files. So is one of the parties lying  or is there some other alternative explanation  And one explanation would be that these parties  these service providers  are not cooperating. Instead  they've been hacked. That would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked. In this case  they've been hacked by their own government. That might sound outlandish  but we already have cases where this has happened  for example  the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government  and which  to spread  subverted the security of the Windows Update network  meaning here  the company was hacked by their own government. And there's more evidence supporting this theory as well. Der Spiegel  from Germany  leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies. Inside NSA  the unit is called TAO  Tailored Access Operations  and inside GCHQ  which is the U.K. equivalent  it's called NAC  Network Analysis Centre. And these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this GCHQ intelligence agency from the United Kingdom targeting a telecom here in Belgium. And what this really means is that an E.U. country's intelligence agency is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose  and they discuss it in their slides completely casually  business as usual. Here's the primary target  here's the secondary target  here's the teaming. They probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub. They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like  you know   Success   when they gain access to services like this. What the hell  And then there's the argument that okay  yes  this might be going on  but then again  other countries are doing it as well. All countries spy. And maybe that's true. Many countries spy  not all of them  but let's take an example. Let's take  for example  Sweden. I'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the United States. When your data traffic goes through Sweden  their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic. All right  how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use  every day  U.S. based services  like  you know  run Windows or OSX  or use Facebook or LinkedIn  or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox  or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support  And the answer is  every single Swedish business leader does that every single day. And then we turn it around. How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services  And the answer is zero. So this is not balanced. It's not balanced by any means  not even close. And when we do have the occasional European success story  even those  then  typically end up being sold to the United States. Like  Skype used to be secure. It used to be end to end encrypted. Then it was sold to the United States. Today  it no longer is secure. So once again  we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose  making all of us less secure as an outcome. And then the argument that the United States is only fighting terrorists. It's the war on terror. You shouldn't worry about it. Well  it's not the war on terror. Yes  part of it is war on terror  and yes  there are terrorists  and they do kill and maim  and we should fight them  but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders  to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil  to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament  and I don't think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the E.U. Parliament  right  It's not the war on terror. Part of it might be  and there are terrorists  but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them  Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists  And the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the E.U. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom  Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat  we are ready to do anything at all  But people are scared about terrorists  and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide. Feel free to survey me if that helps. And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn't thought about this long enough. Because we have this thing called privacy  and if you really think that you have nothing to hide  please make sure that's the first thing you tell me  because then I know that I should not trust you with any secrets  because obviously you can't keep a secret. But people are brutally honest with the Internet  and when these leaks started  many people were asking me about this. And I have nothing to hide. I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal. Yet  I have nothing that I would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency  especially a foreign intelligence agency. And if we indeed need a Big Brother  I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother than a foreign Big Brother. And when the leaks started  the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how  when you've been using search engines  you've been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence. And two minutes later  I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me  like  why am I worried about this  What am I sending to worry about this  Am I sending naked pictures or something  And my answer to Kimberly was that what I'm sending is none of your business  and it should be none of your government's business either. Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy. Privacy is nonnegotiable. It should be built in to all the systems we use. And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines. You show me your search history  and I'll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes. We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families. Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you. And this is all the kind of information we are giving away  we are giving away to the United States. And surveillance changes history. We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon. Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today. And let me actually quote the president of Brazil  Ms. Dilma Rousseff. She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance. Her email was read  and she spoke at the United Nations Headquarters  and she said   If there is no right to privacy  there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion  and therefore  there can be no effective democracy.  That's what it's about. Privacy is the building block of our democracies. And to quote a fellow security researcher  Marcus Ranum  he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies. So we are back to the age of colonization  and we  the foreign users of the Internet  we should think about Americans as our masters. So Mr. Snowden  he's been blamed for many things. Some are blaming him for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations    and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore for causing global warming. So  what is there to be done  Should we worry. No  we shouldn't worry. We should be angry  because this is wrong  and it's rude  and it should not be done. But that's not going to really change the situation. What's going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States. And that's much easier said than done. How do you do that  A single country  any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S. made operating systems and cloud services. But maybe you don't have to do it alone. Maybe you can do it together with other countries. The solution is open source. By building together open  free  secure systems  we can go around such surveillance  and then one country doesn't have to solve the problem by itself. It only has to solve one little problem. And to quote a fellow security researcher  Haroon Meer  one country only has to make a small wave  but those small waves together become a tide  and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time  and the tide we will build with secure  free  open source systems  will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state. Thank you very much. So why do we learn mathematics  Essentially  for three reasons  calculation  application  and last  and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it  inspiration. Mathematics is the science of patterns  and we study it to learn how to think logically  critically and creatively  but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated  and when our students ask   Why are we learning this   then they often hear that they'll need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test. But wouldn't it be great if every once in a while we did mathematics simply because it was fun or beautiful or because it excited the mind  Now  I know many people have not had the opportunity to see how this can happen  so let me give you a quick example with my favorite collection of numbers  the Fibonacci numbers.  Applause  Yeah  I already have Fibonacci fans here. That's great. Now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways. From the standpoint of calculation  they're as easy to understand as one plus one  which is two. Then one plus two is three  two plus three is five  three plus five is eight  and so on. Indeed  the person we call Fibonacci was actually named Leonardo of Pisa  and these numbers appear in his book  Liber Abaci   which taught the Western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today. In terms of applications  Fibonacci numbers appear in nature surprisingly often. The number of petals on a flower is typically a Fibonacci number  or the number of spirals on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a Fibonacci number as well. In fact  there are many more applications of Fibonacci numbers  but what I find most inspirational about them are the beautiful number patterns they display. Let me show you one of my favorites. Suppose you like to square numbers  and frankly  who doesn't   Laughter  Let's look at the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers. So one squared is one  two squared is four  three squared is nine  five squared is     and so on. Now  it's no surprise that when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers  you get the next Fibonacci number. Right  That's how they're created. But you wouldn't expect anything special to happen when you add the squares together. But check this out. One plus one gives us two  and one plus four gives us five. And four plus nine is     nine plus    is     and yes  the pattern continues. In fact  here's another one. Suppose you wanted to look at adding the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers. Let's see what we get there. So one plus one plus four is six. Add nine to that  we get   . Add     we get   . Add     we get    . Now look at those numbers. Those are not Fibonacci numbers  but if you look at them closely  you'll see the Fibonacci numbers buried inside of them. Do you see it  I'll show it to you. Six is two times three     is three times five     is five times eight  two  three  five  eight  who do we appreciate  Fibonacci  Of course. Now  as much fun as it is to discover these patterns  it's even more satisfying to understand why they are true. Let's look at that last equation. Why should the squares of one  one  two  three  five and eight add up to eight times     I'll show you by drawing a simple picture. We'll start with a one by one square and next to that put another one by one square. Together  they form a one by two rectangle. Beneath that  I'll put a two by two square  and next to that  a three by three square  beneath that  a five by five square  and then an eight by eight square  creating one giant rectangle  right  Now let me ask you a simple question  what is the area of the rectangle  Well  on the one hand  it's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it  right  Just as we created it. It's one squared plus one squared plus two squared plus three squared plus five squared plus eight squared. Right  That's the area. On the other hand  because it's a rectangle  the area is equal to its height times its base  and the height is clearly eight  and the base is five plus eight  which is the next Fibonacci number    . Right  So the area is also eight times   . Since we've correctly calculated the area two different ways  they have to be the same number  and that's why the squares of one  one  two  three  five and eight add up to eight times   . Now  if we continue this process  we'll generate rectangles of the form    by        by     and so on. Now check this out. If you divide    by eight  you get  .   . And if you divide the larger number by the smaller number  then these ratios get closer and closer to about  .     known to many people as the Golden Ratio  a number which has fascinated mathematicians  scientists and artists for centuries. Now  I show all this to you because  like so much of mathematics  there's a beautiful side to it that I fear does not get enough attention in our schools. We spend lots of time learning about calculation  but let's not forget about application  including  perhaps  the most important application of all  learning how to think. If I could summarize this in one sentence  it would be this  Mathematics is not just solving for x  it's also figuring out why. Thank you very much.  Give me liberty or give me death.  When Patrick Henry  the governor of Virginia  said these words in       he could never have imagined just how much they would come to resonate with American generations to come. At the time  these words were earmarked and targeted against the British  but over the last     years  they've come to embody what many Westerners believe  that freedom is the most cherished value  and that the best systems of politics and economics have freedom embedded in them. Who could blame them  Over the past hundred years  the combination of liberal democracy and private capitalism has helped to catapult the United States and Western countries to new levels of economic development. In the United States over the past hundred years  incomes have increased    times  and hundreds of thousands of people have been moved out of poverty. Meanwhile  American ingenuity and innovation has helped to spur industrialization and also helped in the creation and the building of things like household appliances such as refrigerators and televisions  motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets. It's no surprise  then  that even at the depths of the private capitalism crisis  President Obama said   The question before us is not whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom is unmatched.  Thus  there's understandably a deep seated presumption among Westerners that the whole world will decide to adopt private capitalism as the model of economic growth  liberal democracy  and will continue to prioritize political rights over economic rights. However  to many who live in the emerging markets  this is an illusion  and even though the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  which was signed in       was unanimously adopted  what it did was to mask a schism that has emerged between developed and developing countries  and the ideological beliefs between political and economic rights. This schism has only grown wider. Today  many people who live in the emerging markets  where    percent of the world's population lives  believe that the Western obsession with political rights is beside the point  and what is actually important is delivering on food  shelter  education and healthcare.  Give me liberty or give me death  is all well and good if you can afford it  but if you're living on less than one dollar a day  you're far too busy trying to survive and to provide for your family than to spend your time going around trying to proclaim and defend democracy. Now  I know many people in this room and around the world will think   Well actually  this is hard to grasp   because private capitalism and liberal democracy are held sacrosanct. But I ask you today  what would you do if you had to choose  What if you had to choose between a roof over your head and the right to vote  Over the last    years  I've had the privilege to travel to over    countries  many of them in the emerging markets  in Latin America  Asia  and my own continent of Africa. I've met with presidents  dissidents  policymakers  lawyers  teachers  doctors and the man on the street  and through these conversations  it's become clear to me that many people in the emerging markets believe that there's actually a split occurring between what people believe ideologically in terms of politics and economics in the West and that which people believe in the rest of the world. Now  don't get me wrong. I'm not saying people in the emerging markets don't understand democracy  nor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally like to pick their presidents or their leaders. Of course they would. However  I am saying that on balance  they worry more about where their living standard improvements are going to come from  and how it is their governments can deliver for them  than whether or not the government was elected by democracy. The fact of the matter is that this has become a very poignant question because there is for the first time in a long time a real challenge to the Western ideological systems of politics and economics  and this is a system that is embodied by China. And rather than have private capitalism  they have state capitalism. Instead of liberal democracy  they have de prioritized the democratic system. And they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights. I put it to you today that it is this system that is embodied by China that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow  because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the shortest period of time. If you will indulge me  I will spend a few moments explaining to you first why economically they've come to this belief. First of all  it's China's economic performance over the past    years. She's been able to produce record economic growth and meaningfully move many people out of poverty  specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty by moving over     million people out of indigence. It's not just in economics  but it's also in terms of living standards. We see that in China     percent of people had secondary school access. Today  it's closer to    percent. So in its totality  economic improvement has been quite significant. Second  China has been able to meaningfully improve its income inequality without changing the political construct. Today  the United States and China are the two leading economies in the world. They have vastly different political systems and different economic systems  one with private capitalism  another one broadly with state capitalism. However  these two countries have the identical GINI Coefficient  which is a measure of income equality. Perhaps what is more disturbing is that China's income equality has been improving in recent times  whereas that of the United States has been declining. Thirdly  people in the emerging markets look at China's amazing and legendary infrastructure rollout. This is not just about China building roads and ports and railways in her own country    she's been able to build        kilometers of road network in China and surpass that of the United States    but even if you look to places like Africa  China has been able to help tar the distance of Cape Town to Cairo  which is       miles  or three times the distance of New York to California. Now this is something that people can see and point to. Perhaps it's no surprise that in a      Pew survey  when surveyed  Africans in    countries said they thought that the Chinese were doing amazing things to improve their livelihoods by wide margins  by as much as    percent. Finally  China is also providing innovative solutions to age old social problems that the world faces. If you travel to Mogadishu  Mexico City or Mumbai  you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics continue to be a stumbling block to the delivery of medicine and healthcare in the rural areas. However  through a network of state owned enterprises  the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas  using their companies to help deliver on these healthcare solutions. Ladies and gentlemen  it's no surprise that around the world  people are pointing at what China is doing and saying   I like that. I want that. I want to be able to do what China's doing. That is the system that seems to work.  I'm here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what China is doing in the democratic stance. In particular  there is growing doubt among people in the emerging markets  when people now believe that democracy is no longer to be viewed as a prerequisite for economic growth. In fact  countries like Taiwan  Singapore  Chile  not just China  have shown that actually  it's economic growth that is a prerequisite for democracy. In a recent study  the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last. The study found that if your per capita income is about       dollars a year  your democracy will last about eight and a half years. If your per capita income is between       and       dollars per year  then you're likely to only get    years of democracy. And only if your per capita income is above       dollars a year will you have democracy come hell or high water. What this is telling us is that we need to first establish a middle class that is able to hold the government accountable. But perhaps it's also telling us that we should be worried about going around the world and shoehorning democracy  because ultimately we run the risk of ending up with illiberal democracies  democracies that in some sense could be worse than the authoritarian governments that they seek to replace. The evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing. Freedom House finds that although    percent of the world's countries today are democratic     percent of those countries are illiberal in the sense that people don't have free speech or freedom of movement. But also  we're finding from Freedom House in a study that they published last year that freedom has been on the decline every year for the past seven years. What this says is that for people like me who care about liberal democracy  is we've got to find a more sustainable way of ensuring that we have a sustainable form of democracy in a liberal way  and that has its roots in economics. But it also says that as China moves toward being the largest economy in the world  something that is expected to happen by experts in       that this schism between the political and economic ideologies of the West and the rest is likely to widen. What might that world look like  Well  the world could look like more state involvement and state capitalism  greater protectionisms of nation states  but also  as I just pointed out a moment ago  ever declining political rights and individual rights. The question that is left for us in general is  what then should the West be doing  And I suggest that they have two options. The West can either compete or cooperate. If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model  and in effect go around the world and continue to try and push an agenda of private capitalism and liberal democracy  this is basically going against headwinds  but it also would be a natural stance for the West to take because in many ways it is the antithesis of the Chinese model of de prioritizing democracy  and state capitalism. Now the fact of the matter is  if the West decides to compete  it will create a wider schism. The other option is for the West to cooperate  and by cooperating I mean giving the emerging market countries the flexibility to figure out in an organic way what political and economic system works best for them. Now I'm sure some of you in the room will be thinking  well  this is like ceding to China  and this is a way  in other words  for the West to take a back seat. But I put it to you that if the United States and European countries want to remain globally influential  they may have to consider cooperating in the short term in order to compete  and by that  they might have to focus more aggressively on economic outcomes to help create the middle class and therefore be able to hold government accountable and create the democracies that we really want. The fact of the matter is that instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with China  the West should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions. Instead of criticizing China for bad behavior  the West should be showing how it is that their own system of politics and economics is the superior one. And instead of shoehorning democracy around the world  perhaps the West should take a leaf out of its own history book and remember that it takes a lot of patience in order to develop the models and the systems that you have today. Indeed  the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer reminds us that it took the United States nearly     years from the time that the Constitution was written for there to be equal rights in the United States. Some people would argue that today there is still no equal rights. In fact  there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law. At its very best  the Western model speaks for itself. It's the model that put food on the table. It's the refrigerators. It put a man on the moon. But the fact of the matter is  although people back in the day used to point at the Western countries and say   I want that  I like that   there's now a new person in town in the form of a country  China. Today  generations are looking at China and saying   China can produce infrastructure  China can produce economic growth  and we like that.  Because ultimately  the question before us  and the question before seven billion people on the planet is  how can we create prosperity  People who care and will pivot towards the model of politics and economics in a very rational way  to those models that will ensure that they can have better living standards in the shortest period of time. As you leave here today  I would like to leave you with a very personal message  which is what it is that I believe we should be doing as individuals  and this is really about being open minded  open minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams of creating prosperity for people around the world  creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty for hundreds of millions of people  has to be based in being open minded  because these systems have good things and they have bad things. Just to illustrate  I went into my annals of myself. That's a picture of me. Awww.  Laughter  I was born and raised in Zambia in     . At the time of my birth  blacks were not issued birth certificates  and that law only changed in     . This is an affidavit from the Zambian government. I bring this to you to tell you that in    years  I've gone from not being recognized as a human being to standing in front of the illustrious TED crowd today to talk to you about my views. In this vein  we can increase economic growth. We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty. But also  it's going to require that we look at our assumptions  assumptions and strictures that we've grown up with around democracy  around private capitalism  around what creates economic growth and reduces poverty and creates freedoms. We might have to tear those books up and start to look at other options and be open minded to seek the truth. Ultimately  it's about transforming the world and making it a better place. Thank you very much. So  stepping down out of the bus  I headed back to the corner to head west en route to a braille training session. It was the winter of       and I had been blind for about a year. Things were going pretty well. Safely reaching the other side  I turned to the left  pushed the auto button for the audible pedestrian signal  and waited my turn. As it went off  I took off and safely got to the other side. Stepping onto the sidewalk  I then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me. I know there's a cafe on the corner  and they have chairs out in front  so I just adjusted to the left to get closer to the street. As I did  so slid the chair. I just figured I'd made a mistake  and went back to the right  and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity. Now I was getting a little anxious. I went back to the left  and so slid the chair  blocking my path of travel. Now  I was officially freaking out. So I yelled   Who the hell's out there  What's going on   Just then  over my shout  I heard something else  a familiar rattle. It sounded familiar  and I quickly considered another possibility  and I reached out with my left hand  as my fingers brushed against something fuzzy  and I came across an ear  the ear of a dog  perhaps a golden retriever. Its leash had been tied to the chair as her master went in for coffee  and she was just persistent in her efforts to greet me  perhaps get a scratch behind the ear. Who knows  maybe she was volunteering for service. But that little story is really about the fears and misconceptions that come along with the idea of moving through the city without sight  seemingly oblivious to the environment and the people around you. So let me step back and set the stage a little bit. On St. Patrick's Day of       I reported to the hospital for surgery to remove a brain tumor. The surgery was successful. Two days later  my sight started to fail. On the third day  it was gone. Immediately  I was struck by an incredible sense of fear  of confusion  of vulnerability  like anybody would. But as I had time to stop and think  I actually started to realize I had a lot to be grateful for. In particular  I thought about my dad  who had passed away from complications from brain surgery. He was   . I was seven at the time. So although I had every reason to be fearful of what was ahead  and had no clue quite what was going to happen  I was alive. My son still had his dad. And besides  it's not like I was the first person ever to lose their sight. I knew there had to be all sorts of systems and techniques and training to have to live a full and meaningful  active life without sight. So by the time I was discharged from the hospital a few days later  I left with a mission  a mission to get out and get the best training as quickly as I could and get on to rebuilding my life. Within six months  I had returned to work. My training had started. I even started riding a tandem bike with my old cycling buddies  and was commuting to work on my own  walking through town and taking the bus. It was a lot of hard work. But what I didn't anticipate through that rapid transition was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition of my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience of the same places and the same people within such a short period of time. From that came a lot of insights  or outsights  as I called them  things that I learned since losing my sight. These outsights ranged from the trival to the profound  from the mundane to the humorous. As an architect  that stark juxtaposition of my sighted and unsighted experience of the same places and the same cities within such a short period of time has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights of the city itself. Paramount amongst those was the realization that  actually  cities are fantastic places for the blind. And then I was also surprised by the city's propensity for kindness and care as opposed to indifference or worse. And then I started to realize that it seemed like the blind seemed to have a positive influence on the city itself. That was a little curious to me. Let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind. Inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss is learning to rely on all your non visual senses  things that you would otherwise maybe ignore. It's like a whole new world of sensory information opens up to you. I was really struck by the symphony of subtle sounds all around me in the city that you can hear and work with to understand where you are  how you need to move  and where you need to go. Similarly  just through the grip of the cane  you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below  and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you're headed. Similarly  just the sun warming one side of your face or the wind at your neck gives you clues about your alignment and your progression through a block and your movement through time and space. But also  the sense of smell. Some districts and cities have their own smell  as do places and things around you  and if you're lucky  you can even follow your nose to that new bakery that you've been looking for. All this really surprised me  because I started to realize that my unsighted experienced was so far more multi sensory than my sighted experience ever was. What struck me also was how much the city was changing around me. When you're sighted  everybody kind of sticks to themselves  you mind your own business. Lose your sight  though  and it's a whole other story. And I don't know who's watching who  but I have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me. And I'm not paranoid  but everywhere I go  I'm getting all sorts of advice  Go here  move there  watch out for this. A lot of the information is good. Some of it's helpful. A lot of it's kind of reversed. You've got to figure out what they actually meant. Some of it's kind of wrong and not helpful. But it's all good in the grand scheme of things. But one time I was in Oakland walking along Broadway  and came to a corner. I was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal  and as it went off  I was just about to step out into the street  when all of a sudden  my right hand was just gripped by this guy  and he yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street  speaking to me in Mandarin. It's like  there was no escape from this man's death grip  but he got me safely there. What could I do  But believe me  there are more polite ways to offer assistance. We don't know you're there  so it's kind of nice to say  Hello  first.  Would you like some help   But while in Oakland  I've really been struck by how much the city of Oakland changed as I lost my sight. I liked it sighted. It was fine. It's a perfectly great city. But once I lost my sight and was walking along Broadway  I was blessed every block of the way.  Bless you  man.   Go for it  brother.   God bless you.  I didn't get that sighted. And even without sight  I don't get that in San Francisco. And I know it bothers some of my blind friends  it's not just me. Often it's thought that that's an emotion that comes up out of pity. I tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity  out of our togetherness  and I think it's pretty cool. In fact  if I'm feeling down  I just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland  I go for a walk  and I feel better like that  in no time at all. But also that it illustrates how disability and blindness sort of cuts across ethnic  social  racial  economic lines. Disability is an equal opportunity provider. Everybody's welcome. In fact  I've heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people  There are those with disabilities  and there are those that haven't quite found theirs yet. It's a different way of thinking about it  but I think it's kind of beautiful  because it is certainly far more inclusive than the us versus them or the abled versus the disabled  and it's a lot more honest and respectful of the fragility of life. So my final takeaway for you is that not only is the city good for the blind  but the city needs us. And I'm so sure of that that I want to propose to you today that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities  and not the people that are thought about after the mold has already been cast. It's too late then. So if you design a city with the blind in mind  you'll have a rich  walkable network of sidewalks with a dense array of options and choices all available at the street level. If you design a city with the blind in mind  sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous. The space between buildings will be well balanced between people and cars. In fact  cars  who needs them  If you're blind  you don't drive.  Laughter  They don't like it when you drive.  Laughter  If you design a city with the blind in mind  you design a city with a robust  accessible  well connected mass transit system that connects all parts of the city and the region all around. If you design a city with the blind in mind  there'll be jobs  lots of jobs. Blind people want to work too. They want to earn a living. So  in designing a city for the blind  I hope you start to realize that it actually would be a more inclusive  a more equitable  a more just city for all. And based on my prior sighted experience  it sounds like a pretty cool city  whether you're blind  whether you have a disability  or you haven't quite found yours yet. So thank you. I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid. I don't know his name  but I do know his story. He lives in a small village in southern Somalia. His village is near Mogadishu. Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation. With nothing left for him there  he leaves for the big city  in this case  Mogadishu  the capital of Somalia. When he arrives  there are no opportunities  no jobs  no way forward. He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu. Maybe a year passes  nothing. One day  he's approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch  then to dinner  to breakfast. He meets this dynamic group of people  and they give him a break. He's given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes  money to send back home to his family. He is introduced to this young woman. He eventually gets married. He starts this new life. He has a purpose in life. One beautiful day in Mogadishu  under an azure blue sky  a car bomb goes off. That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber  and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab  a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda. So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up  He was waiting. He was waiting for an opportunity  waiting to begin his future  waiting for a way forward  and this was the first thing that came along. This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood. And his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world. It is the story of the disenfranchised  unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg  sparks riots in London  who reaches out for something other than waithood. For young people  the promise of the city  the big city dream is that of opportunity  of jobs  of wealth  but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities. Often it's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates. By       three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of   . If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities  if we do not provide them opportunities  the story of waithood  the gateway to terrorism  to violence  to gangs  will be the story of cities  . . And in my city of birth  Mogadishu     percent of young people suffer from unemployment.    percent don't work  don't go to school. They pretty much do nothing. I went back to Mogadishu last month  and I went to visit Madina Hospital  the hospital I was born in. I remember standing in front of that bullet ridden hospital thinking  what if I had never left  What if I had been forced into that same state of waithood  Would I have become a terrorist  I'm not really sure about the answer. My reason for being in Mogadishu that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit. I brought together about    young Somali leaders. We sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city. One of the young men in the room was Aden. He went to university in Mogadishu  graduated. There were no jobs  no opportunities. I remember him telling me  because he was a college graduate  unemployed  frustrated  that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations  to be recruited. They sought people like him out. But his story takes a different route. In Mogadishu  the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads. Twenty three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system  and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around. Aden saw an opportunity and seized it. He started a motorbike company. He began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn't normally afford them. He bought    bikes  with the help of family and friends  and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years. How is this story different  What makes his story different  I believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity. It's entrepreneurship  and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood. It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking. And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs. I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings  Mohamed Mohamoud  a florist. He was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship. He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen in over    years  and until recently  until Mohamed came along  if you wanted flowers at your wedding  you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad. If you asked someone   When was the last time you saw fresh flowers   for many who grew up under civil war  the answer would be   Never.  So Mohamed saw an opportunity. He started a landscaping and design floral company. He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu  and started growing tulips and lilies  which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate. And he began delivering flowers to weddings  creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city  and he's now working on creating Mogadishu's first public park in    years. There's no public park in Mogadishu. He wants to create a space where families  young people  can come together  and  as he says  smell the proverbial roses. And he doesn't grow roses because they use too much water  by the way. So the first step is to inspire young people  and in that room  Mohamed's presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room. They had never really thought about starting up a business. They've thought about working for an NGO  working for the government  but his story  his innovation  really had a strong impact on them. He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity. He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs  that they could be change makers. By the end of the day  they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city. They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems. So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step  but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality. They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses. Connect young people with the resources they need  provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation  and you will create catalysts for urban growth. For me  entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business. It's about creating a social impact. Mohamed is not simply selling flowers. I believe he is selling hope. His Peace Park  and that's what he calls it  when it's created  will actually transform the way people see their city. Aden hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him. He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood. These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities. So my suggestion is  turn youth into entrepreneurs  incubate and nurture their inherent innovation  and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood. Thank you. Five years ago  I was on a sabbatical  and I returned to the medical university where I studied. I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in    years  in fact since I became a management consultant. There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent. The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost cutting  and the second thing  which really bothered me  actually  was that several of the colleagues I met  former friends from medical school  who I knew to be some of the smartest  most motivated  engaged and passionate people I'd ever met  many of them had turned cynical  disengaged  or had distanced themselves from hospital management. So with this focus on cost cutting  I asked myself  are we forgetting the patient  Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare. It's a big part of the national budgets. And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth. In some countries  we have long waiting times for patients for surgery. In other countries  new drugs are not being reimbursed  and therefore don't reach patients. In several countries  doctors and nurses are the targets  to some extent  for the governments. After all  the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses. You choose an expensive lab test  you choose to operate on an old and frail patient. So  by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians  this is a way to hold costs down. And ultimately  some physicians will say today that they don't have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients. So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated. At BCG  we looked at this  and we asked ourselves  this can't be the right way of managing healthcare. And so we took a step back and we said   What is it that we are trying to achieve   Ultimately  in the healthcare system  we're aiming at improving health for the patients  and we need to do so at a limited  or affordable  cost. We call this value based healthcare. On the screen behind me  you see what we mean by value  outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend. This was described beautifully in a book in      by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg. On this picture  you have my father in law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters. When we started doing our research at BCG  we decided not to look so much at the costs  but to look at the quality instead  and in the research  one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw. You compare hospitals in a country  you'll find some that are extremely good  but you'll find a large number that are vastly much worse. The differences were dramatic. Erik  my father in law  he suffers from prostate cancer  and he probably needs surgery. Now living in Europe  he can choose to go to Germany that has a well reputed healthcare system. If he goes there and goes to the average hospital  he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about    percent  so he would have to start wearing diapers again. You flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot. If he instead would go to Hamburg  and to a clinic called the Martini Klinik  the risk would be only one in   . Either you a flip a coin  or you have a one in    risk. That's a huge difference  a seven fold difference. When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases  we see these huge differences. But you and I don't know. We don't have the data. And often  the data actually doesn't exist. Nobody knows. So going the hospital is a lottery. Now  it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope. In the late '  s  there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting  and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery. To the left of this slide  you see a variety of metal pieces  artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip. They all realized they had their individual way of operating. They all argued that   My technique is the best   but none of them actually knew  and they admitted that. So they said   We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what's best.  So they in fact spent two years debating   So what is quality in hip surgery    Oh  we should measure this.   No  we should measure that.  And they finally agreed. And once they had agreed  they started measuring  and started sharing the data. Very quickly  they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in  it actually lasted a lot longer  and most patients would never have to be re operated on in their lifetime. They published the data  and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country. Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense. Since then  they publish every year. Once a year  they publish the league table  who's best  who's at the bottom  And they visit each other to try to learn  so a continuous cycle of improvement. For many years  Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world  at least for those who actually were measuring  and many were not. Now I found this principle really exciting. So the physicians get together  they agree on what quality is  they start measuring  they share the data  they find who's best  and they learn from it. Continuous improvement. Now  that's not the only exciting part. That's exciting in itself. But if you bring back the cost side of the equation  and look at that  it turns out  those who have focused on quality  they actually also have the lowest costs  although that's not been the purpose in the first place. So if you look at the hip surgery story again  there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden. They looked at how many patients have needed to be re operated on seven years after the first surgery. In the United States  the number was three times higher than in Sweden. So many unnecessary surgeries  and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period. Now  you can imagine how much savings there would be for society. We did a study where we looked at OECD data. OECD does  every so often  look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries. The United States has  for many diseases  actually a quality which is below the average in OECD. Now  if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality  and raise quality just to the level of average OECD  it would save the American people     billion U.S. dollars a year. That's    percent of the budget  of the healthcare budget of the country. Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic  and it's all logical  but is it possible  This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare  and I would argue that not only can it be done  but it has to be done. The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system. In my practice as a consultant  I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year. The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients. Physicians are  like most of you in the audience  very competitive. They were always best in class. We were always best in class. And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do  they will do whatever it takes to improve. But most of them don't know. But physicians have another characteristic. They actually thrive from peer recognition. If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results  they will share. They will share the information on how to improve. So it is  by measuring and creating transparency  you get a cycle of continuous improvement  which is what this slide shows. Now  you may say this is a nice idea  but this isn't only an idea. This is happening in reality. We're creating a global community  and a large global community  where we'll be able to measure and compare what we achieve. Together with two academic institutions  Michael Porter at Harvard Business School  and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden  BCG has formed something we call ICHOM. You may think that's a sneeze  but it's not a sneeze  it's an acronym. It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement. We're bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss  disease by disease  what is really quality  what should we measure  and to make those standards global. They've worked    four working groups have worked during the past year  cataracts  back pain  coronary artery disease  which is  for instance  heart attack  and prostate cancer. The four groups will publish their data in November of this year. That's the first time we'll be comparing apples to apples  not only within a country  but between countries. Next year  we're planning to do eight diseases  the year after    . In three years' time  we plan to have covered    percent of the disease burden. Compare apples to apples. Who's better  Why is that  Five months ago  I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe. They have a new CEO  and she has a vision  I want to manage my big institution much more on quality  outcomes that matter to patients. This particular day  we sat in a workshop together with physicians  nurses and other staff  discussing leukemia in children. The group discussed  how do we measure quality today  Can we measure it better than we do  We discussed  how do we treat these kids  what are important improvements  And we discussed what are the costs for these patients  can we do treatment more efficiently  There was an enormous energy in the room. There were so many ideas  so much enthusiasm. At the end of the meeting  the chairman of the department  he stood up. He looked over the group and he said    first he raised his hand  I forgot that    he raised his hand  clenched his fist  and then he said to the group   Thank you. Thank you. Today  we're finally discussing what this hospital does the right way.  By measuring value in healthcare  that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients  we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution. I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution  and I'm convinced that the founder of modern medicine  the Greek Hippocrates  who always put the patient at the center  he would smile in his grave. Thank you. Today I am going to teach you how to play my favorite game  massively multiplayer thumb wrestling. It's the only game in the world that I know of that allows you  the player  the opportunity to experience    positive emotions in    seconds or less. This is true  so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute  you will get to feel joy  relief  love  surprise  pride  curiosity  excitement  awe and wonder  contentment  and creativity  all in the span of one minute. So this sounds pretty good  right  Now you're willing to play. In order to teach you this game  I'm going to need some volunteers to come up onstage really quickly  and we're going to do a little hands on demo. While they're coming up  I should let you know  this game was invented    years ago by an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom. So thank you  Monochrom. Okay  so most people are familiar with traditional  two person thumb wrestling. Sunni  let's just remind them. One  two  three  four   I declare a thumb war  and we wrestle  and of course Sunni beats me because she's the best. Now the first thing about massively multiplayer thumb wrestling  we're the gamer generation. There are a billion gamers on the planet now  so we need more of a challenge. So the first thing we need is more thumbs. So Eric  come on over. So we could get three thumbs together  and Peter could join us. We could even have four thumbs together  and the way you win is you're the first person to pin someone else's thumb. This is really important. You can't  like  wait while they fight it out and then swoop in at the last minute. That is not how you win. Ah  who did that  Eric you did that. So Eric would have won. He was the first person to pin my thumb. Okay  so that's the first rule  and we can see that three or four is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node  but if you feel ambitious  you don't have to hold back. We can really go for it. So you can see up here. Now the only other rule you need to remember is  gamer generation  we like a challenge. I happen to notice you all have some thumbs you're not using. So I think we should kind of get some more involved. And if we had just four people  we would do it just like this  and we would try and wrestle both thumbs at the same time. Perfect. Now  if we had more people in the room  instead of just wrestling in a closed node  we might reach out and try and grab some other people. And in fact  that's what we're going to do right now. We're going to try and get all  something like  I don't know        thumbs in this room connected in a single node. And we have to connect both levels  so if you're up there  you're going to be reaching down and reaching up. Now    Laughter    before we get started    This is great. You're excited to play.   before we get started  can I have the slides back up here really quick  because if you get good at this game  I want you to know there are some advanced levels. So this is the kind of simple level  right  But there are advanced configurations. This is called the Death Star Configuration. Any Star Wars fans  And this one's called the M bius Strip. Any science geeks  you get that one. This is the hardest level. This is the extreme. So we'll stick with the normal one for now  and I'm going to give you    seconds  every thumb into the node  connect the upper and the lower levels  you guys go on down there. Thirty seconds. Into the network. Make the node. Stand up  It's easier if you stand up. Everybody  up up up up up  Stand up  my friends. All right. Don't start wrestling yet. If you have a free thumb  wave it around  make sure it gets connected. Okay. We need to do a last minute thumb check. If you have a free thumb  wave it around to make sure. Grab that thumb  Reach behind you. There you go. Any other thumbs  Okay  on the count of three  you're going to go. Try to keep track. Grab  grab  grab it. Okay  One  two  three  go  Did you win  You got it  You got it  Excellent  Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much. All right. While you are basking in the glow of having won your first massively multiplayer thumb wrestling game  let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions. So curiosity. I said  massively multiplayer thumb wrestling.  You were like   What the hell is she talking about   So I provoked a little curiosity. Creativity  it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thumbs into the node. I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up. So you used creativity. That was great. How about surprise  The actual feeling of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once is pretty surprising. You heard that sound go up in the room. We had excitement. As you started to wrestle  maybe you're starting to win or this person's  like  really into it  so you kind of get the excitement going. We have relief. You got to stand up. You've been sitting for awhile  so the physical relief  getting to shake it out. We had joy. You were laughing  smiling. Look at your faces. This room is full of joy. We had some contentment. I didn't see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing  so you were totally content to be playing. The most important three emotions  awe and wonder  we had everybody connected physically for a minute. When was the last time you were at TED and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room  And it's truly awesome and wondrous. And speaking of physical connection  you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin  you release oxytocin  you feel bonded to everyone in the room. You guys know that the best way to release oxytocin quickly is to hold someone else's hand for at least six seconds. You guys were all holding hands for way more than six seconds  so we are all now biochemically primed to love each other. That is great. And the last emotion of pride. How many people are like me. Just admit it. You lost both your thumbs. It just didn't work out for you. That's okay  because you learned a new skill today. You learned  from scratch  a game you never knew before. Now you know how to play it. You can teach other people. So congratulations. How many of you won just won thumb  All right. I have very good news for you. According to the official rules of massively multiplayer thumb wrestling  this makes you a grandmaster of the game. Because there aren't that many people who know how to play  we have to kind of accelerate the program more than a game like chess. So congratulations  grandmasters. Win one thumb once  you will become a grandmaster. Did anybody win both their thumbs  Yes. Awesome. Okay. Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status. You guys  according to the rules  are legendary grandmasters  so congratulations. I will just leave you with this tip  if you want to play again. The best way to become a legendary grandmaster  you've got your two nodes going on. Pick off the one that looks easiest. They're not paying attention. They look kind of weak. Focus on that one and do something crazy with this arm. As soon as you win  suddenly stop. Everybody is thrown off. You go in for the kill. That's how you become a legendary grandmaster of massively multiplayer thumb wrestling. Thank you for letting me teach you my favorite game. Wooo   Applause  Thank you.  Applause  When we think of Nepal  we tend to think of the snow capped mountains of the Himalayas  the crystal clear still waters of its alpine lakes  or the huge expanse of its grasslands. What some of us may not realize is that in the Himalayan foothills  where the climate is much warmer and the landscape much greener  there lives a great diversity of wildlife  including the one horned rhinoceros  the Asian elephant and the Bengal tiger. But unfortunately  these animals are under constant threat from poachers who hunt and kill them for their body parts. To stop the killing of these animals  battalions of soldiers and rangers are sent to protect Nepal's national parks  but that is not an easy task  because these soldiers have to patrol thousands of hectares of forests on foot or elephant backs. It is also risky for these soldiers when they get into gunfights with poachers  and therefore Nepal is always looking for new ways to help with protecting the forests and wildlife. Well recently  Nepal acquired a new tool in the fight against wildlife crime  and these are drones  or more specifically  conservation drones. For about a year now  my colleagues and I have been building drones for Nepal and training the park protection personnel on the use of these drones. Not only does a drone give you a bird's eye view of the landscape  but it also allows you to capture detailed  high resolution images of objects on the ground. This  for example  is a pair of rhinoceros taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day in the lowlands of Nepal. Now we believe that drones have tremendous potential  not only for combating wildlife crime  but also for monitoring the health of these wildlife populations. So what is a drone  Well  the kind of drone I'm talking about is simply a model aircraft fitted with an autopilot system  and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer  a GPS  a compass  a barometric altimeter and a few other sensors. Now a drone like this is meant to carry a useful payload  such as a video camera or a photographic camera. It also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission  to tell the drone where to go. Now people I talk to are often surprised when they hear that these are the only four components that make a conservation drone  but they are even more surprised when I tell them how affordable these components are. The facts is  a conservation drone doesn't cost very much more than a good laptop computer or a decent pair of binoculars. So now that you've built your own conservation drone  you probably want to go fly it  but how does one fly a drone  Well  actually  you don't  because the drone flies itself. All you have to do is to program a mission to tell the drone where to fly. But you simply do that by clicking on a few way points on the Google Maps interface using the open source software. Those missions could be as simple as just a few way points  or they could be slightly longer and more complicated  to fly along a river system. Sometimes  we fly the drone in a lawnmower type pattern and take pictures of that area  and those pictures can be processed to produce a map of that forest. Other researchers might want to fly the drone along the boundaries of a forest to watch out for poachers or people who might be trying to enter the forest illegally. Now whatever your mission is  once you've programmed it  you simply upload it to the autopilot system  bring your drone to the field  and launch it simply by tossing it in the air. And often we'll go about this mission taking pictures or videos along the way  and usually at that point  we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee  sit back  and relax for the next few minutes  although some of us sit back and panic for the next few minutes worrying that the drone will not return. Usually it does  and when it does  it even lands automatically. So what can we do with a conservation drone  Well  when we built our first prototype drone  our main objective was to fly it over a remote rainforest in North Sumatra  Indonesia  to look for the nest of a species of great ape known as the orangutan. The reason we wanted to do that was because we needed to know how many individuals of this species are still left in that forest. Now the traditional method of surveying for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot carrying heavy equipment and to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops where you might find an orangutan or its nest. Now as you can imagine  that is a very time consuming  labor intensive  and costly process  so we were hoping that drones could significantly reduce the cost of surveying for orangutan populations in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. So we were very excited when we captured our first pair of orangutan nests on camera. And this is it  this is the first ever picture of orangutan nests taken with a drone. Since then we have taken pictures of dozens of these nests from around various parts of Southeast Asia  and we're now working with computer scientists to develop algorithms that can automatically count the number of nests from the thousands of photos we've collected so far. But nests are not the only objects these drones can detect. This is a wild orangutan happily feeding on top of a palm tree  seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying overhead  not once but several times. We've also taken pictures of other animals including forest buffalos in Gabon  elephants  and even turtle nests. But besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves  we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in  because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats. Sometimes  we zoom out a little and look at other things that might be happening in the landscape. This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra. Now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation in that part of the world  so we wanted to use this new drone technology to keep track of the spread of these plantations in Southeast Asia. But drones could also be used to keep track of illegal logging activities. This is a recently logged forest  again in Sumatra. You could even still see the processed wooden planks left on the ground. But perhaps the most exciting part about taking pictures from the air is we could later stitch these pictures together using special software to create a map of the entire landscape  and this map gives us crucial information for monitoring land use change  to let us know where and when plantations might be expanding  where forests might be contracting  or where fires might be breaking out. Aerial images could also be processed to produce three dimensional computer models of forests. Now these models are not just visually appealing  but they are also geometrically accurate  which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees  calculate surface area  the volume of vegetation  and so on  all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests. Recently  we've also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras. Now these cameras can detect heat emitting objects from the ground  and therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night. So I've told you quite a lot about what conservation drones are  how you might operate one of these drones  and what a drone could do for you. I will now tell you where conservation drones are being used around the world. We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland. We brought a few of these to Indonesia for the first few test flights. Since then  we've been building drones for our collaborators from around the world  and these include fellow biologists and partners from major conservation organizations. Perhaps the best and most rewarding part about working with these collaborators is the feedback they give us on how to improve our drones. Building drones for us is a constant work in progress. We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of their range  their ruggedness  and the amount of payload they can carry. We also work with collaborators to discover new ways of using these drones. For example  camera traps are a common tool used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals hiding in the forests  but these are motion activated cameras  so they snap a picture every time an animal crosses their path. But the problem with camera traps is that the researcher has to go back to the forest every so often to retrieve those images  and that takes a lot of time  especially if there are dozens or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest. Now a drone could be designed to perform the task much more efficiently. This drone  carrying a special sensor  could be flown over the forest and remotely download these images from wi fi enabled cameras. Radio collars are another tool that's commonly used by biologists. Now these collars are put onto animals. They transmit a radio signal which allows the researcher to track the movements of these animals across the landscape. But the traditional way of tracking animals is pretty ridiculous  because it requires the researcher to be walking on the ground carrying a huge and cumbersome radio antenna  not unlike those old TV antennae we used to have on our rooftops. Some of us still do. A drone could be used to do the same job much more efficiently. Why not equip a drone with a scanning radio receiver  fly that over the forest canopy in a certain pattern which would allow the user or the operator to triangulate the location of these radio collared animals remotely without having to step foot in the forest. A third and perhaps most exciting way of using these drones is to fly them to a really remote  never explored before rainforest somewhere hidden in the tropics  and parachute down a tiny spy microphone that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls of mammals  birds  amphibians  the Yeti  the Sasquatch  Bigfoot  whatever. That would give us biologists a pretty good idea of what animals might be living in those forests. And finally  I would like to show you the latest version of our conservation drone. The MAJA drone has a wingspan of about two meters. It weighs only about two kilograms  but it can carry half its weight. It is a fully autonomous system. During its mission  it can even transmit a live video feed back to a ground station laptop  which allows the user to see what the drone is seeing in real time. It carries a variety of sensors  and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel. This drone can stay in the air for    to    minutes  which gives it a range of up to    kilometers. That is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications. Now  conservation drones began as a crazy idea from two biologists who are just deeply passionate about this technology. And we believe  strongly believe  that drones can and will be a game changer for conservation research and applications. We've had our fair share of skeptics and critics who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes. And in a way  they are right. I mean  let's be honest  drones are the ultimate toys for boys. But at the same time  we've also gotten to know many wonderful colleagues and collaborators who share our vision and see the potential of conservation drones. To us  it is obvious that conservation biologists and practitioners should make full use of every available tool  including drones  in our fight to save the last remaining forests and wildlife of this planet. Thank you. Technology can change our understanding of nature. Take for example the case of lions. For centuries  it's been said that female lions do all of the hunting out in the open savanna  and male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner. You've heard this too  I can tell. Well recently  I led an airborne mapping campaign in the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Our colleagues put GPS tracking collars on male and female lions  and we mapped their hunting behavior from the air. The lower left shows a lion sizing up a herd of impala for a kill  and the right shows what I call the lion viewshed. That's how far the lion can see in all directions until his or her view is obstructed by vegetation. And what we found is that male lions are not the lazy hunters we thought them to be. They just use a different strategy. Whereas the female lions hunt out in the open savanna over long distances  usually during the day  male lions use an ambush strategy in dense vegetation  and often at night. This video shows the actual hunting viewsheds of male lions on the left and females on the right. Red and darker colors show more dense vegetation  and the white are wide open spaces. And this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level of hunting male and female lions. All of a sudden  you get a very clear understanding of the very spooky conditions under which male lions do their hunting. I bring up this example to begin  because it emphasizes how little we know about nature. There's been a huge amount of work done so far to try to slow down our losses of tropical forests  and we are losing our forests at a rapid rate  as shown in red on the slide. I find it ironic that we're doing so much  yet these areas are fairly unknown to science. So how can we save what we don't understand  Now I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer with a background in physics and chemistry and biology and a lot of other boring subjects  but above all  I'm obsessed with what we don't know about our planet. So I created this  the Carnegie Airborne Observatory  or CAO. It may look like a plane with a fancy paint job  but I packed it with over       kilos of high tech sensors  computers  and a very motivated staff of Earth scientists and pilots. Two of our instruments are very unique  one is called an imaging spectrometer that can actually measure the chemical composition of plants as we fly over them. Another one is a set of lasers  very high powered lasers  that fire out of the bottom of the plane  sweeping across the ecosystem and measuring it at nearly         times per second in high resolution  D. Here's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco  not far from where I live. Although we flew straight over this bridge  we imaged it in  D  captured its color in just a few seconds. But the real power of the CAO is its ability to capture the actual building blocks of ecosystems. This is a small town in the Amazon  imaged with the CAO. We can slice through our data and see  for example  the  D structure of the vegetation and the buildings  or we can use the chemical information to actually figure out how fast the plants are growing as we fly over them. The hottest pinks are the fastest growing plants. And we can see biodiversity in ways that you never could have imagined. This is what a rainforest might look like as you fly over it in a hot air balloon. This is how we see a rainforest  in kaleidoscopic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another. But you have to remember that these trees are literally bigger than whales  and what that means is that they're impossible to understand just by walking on the ground below them. So our imagery is  D  it's chemical  it's biological  and this tells us not only the species that are living in the canopy  but it tells us a lot of information about the rest of the species that occupy the rainforest. Now I created the CAO in order to answer questions that have proven extremely challenging to answer from any other vantage point  such as from the ground  or from satellite sensors. I want to share three of those questions with you today. The first questions is  how do we manage our carbon reserves in tropical forests  Tropical forests contain a huge amount of carbon in the trees  and we need to keep that carbon in those forests if we're going to avoid any further global warming. Unfortunately  global carbon emissions from deforestation now equals the global transportation sector. That's all ships  airplanes  trains  and automobiles combined. So it's understandable that policy negotiators have been working hard to reduce deforestation  but they're doing it on landscapes that are hardly known to science. If you don't know where the carbon is exactly  in detail  how can you know what you're losing  Basically  we need a high tech accounting system. With our system  we're able to see the carbon stocks of tropical forests in utter detail. The red shows  obviously  closed canopy tropical forest  and then you see the cookie cutting  or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens. It's like cutting a cake except this cake is about whale deep. And yet  we can zoom in and see the forest and the trees at the same time. And what's amazing is  even though we flew very high above this forest  later on in analysis  we can go in and actually experience the treetrops  leaf by leaf  branch by branch  just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves. We've been using the technology to explore and to actually put out the first carbon geographies in high resolution in faraway places like the Amazon Basin and not so faraway places like the United States and Central America. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take you on a high resolution  first time tour of the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama. The colors are going to be going from red to blue. Red is extremely high carbon stocks  your largest cathedral forests you can imagine  and blue are very low carbon stocks. And let me tell you  Peru alone is an amazing place  totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography until today. We can fly to this area in northern Peru and see super high carbon stocks in red  and the Amazon River and floodplain cutting right through it. We can go to an area of utter devastation caused by deforestation in blue  and the virus of deforestation spreading out in orange. We can also fly to the southern Andes to see the tree line and see exactly how the carbon geography ends as we go up into the mountain system. And we can go to the biggest swamp in the western Amazon. It's a watery dreamworld akin to Jim Cameron's  Avatar.  We can go to one of the smallest tropical countries  Panama  and see also a huge range of carbon variation  from high in red to low in blue. Unfortunately  most of the carbon is lost in the lowlands  but what you see that's left  in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds  is the stuff that's up in the mountains. One interesting exception to this is right in the middle of your screen. You're seeing the buffer zone around the Panama Canal. That's in the reds and yellows. The canal authorities are using force to protect their watershed and global commerce. This kind of carbon mapping has transformed conservation and resource policy development. It's really advancing our ability to save forests and to curb climate change. My second question  How do we prepare for climate change in a place like the Amazon rainforest  Let me tell you  I spend a lot of time in these places  and we're seeing the climate changing already. Temperatures are increasing  and what's really happening is we're getting a lot of droughts  recurring droughts. The      mega drought is shown here with red showing an area about the size of Western Europe. The Amazon was so dry in      that even the main stem of the Amazon river itself dried up partially  as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide. What we found is that in very remote areas  these droughts are having a big negative impact on tropical forests. For example  these are all of the dead trees in red that suffered mortality following the      drought. This area happens to be on the border of Peru and Brazil  totally unexplored  almost totally unknown scientifically. So what we think  as Earth scientists  is species are going to have to migrate with climate change from the east in Brazil all the way west into the Andes and up into the mountains in order to minimize their exposure to climate change. One of the problems with this is that humans are taking apart the western Amazon as we speak. Look at this     square kilometer gash in the forest created by gold miners. You see the forest in green in  D  and you see the effects of gold mining down below the soil surface. Species have nowhere to migrate in a system like this  obviously. If you haven't been to the Amazon  you should go. It's an amazing experience every time  no matter where you go. You're going to probably see it this way  on a river. But what happens is a lot of times the rivers hide what's really going on back in the forest itself. We flew over this same river  imaged the system in  D. The forest is on the left. And then we can digitally remove the forest and see what's going on below the canopy. And in this case  we found gold mining activity  all of it illegal  set back away from the river's edge  as you'll see in those strange pockmarks coming up on your screen on the right. Don't worry  we're working with the authorities to deal with this and many  many other problems in the region. So in order to put together a conservation plan for these unique  important corridors like the western Amazon and the Andes Amazon corridor  we have to start making geographically explicit plans now. How do we do that if we don't know the geography of biodiversity in the region  if it's so unknown to science  So what we've been doing is using the laser guided spectroscopy from the CAO to map for the first time the biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest. Here you see actual data showing different species in different colors. Reds are one type of species  blues are another  and greens are yet another. And when we take this together and scale up to the regional level  we get a completely new geography of biodiversity unknown prior to this work. This tells us where the big biodiversity changes occur from habitat to habitat  and that's really important because it tells us a lot about where species may migrate to and migrate from as the climate shifts. And this is the pivotal information that's needed by decision makers to develop protected areas in the context of their regional development plans. And third and final question is  how do we manage biodiversity on a planet of protected ecosystems  The example I started out with about lions hunting  that was a study we did behind the fence line of a protected area in South Africa. And the truth is  much of Africa's nature is going to persist into the future in protected areas like I show in blue on the screen. This puts incredible pressure and responsibility on park management. They need to do and make decisions that will benefit all of the species that they're protecting. Some of their decisions have really big impacts. For example  how much and where to use fire as a management tool  Or  how to deal with a large species like elephants  which may  if their populations get too large  have a negative impact on the ecosystem and on other species. And let me tell you  these types of dynamics really play out on the landscape. In the foreground is an area with lots of fire and lots of elephants  wide open savanna in blue  and just a few trees. As we cross this fence line  now we're getting into an area that has had protection from fire and zero elephants  dense vegetation  a radically different ecosystem. And in a place like Kruger  the soaring elephant densities are a real problem. I know it's a sensitive issue for many of you  and there are no easy answers with this. But what's good is that the technology we've developed and we're working with in South Africa  for example  is allowing us to map every single tree in the savanna  and then through repeat flights we're able to see which trees are being pushed over by elephants  in the red as you see on the screen  and how much that's happening in different types of landscapes in the savanna. That's giving park managers a very first opportunity to use tactical management strategies that are more nuanced and don't lead to those extremes that I just showed you. So really  the way we're looking at protected areas nowadays is to think of it as tending to a circle of life  where we have fire management  elephant management  those impacts on the structure of the ecosystem  and then those impacts affecting everything from insects up to apex predators like lions. Going forward  I plan to greatly expand the airborne observatory. I'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit so we can manage the entire planet with technologies like this. Until then  you're going to find me flying in some remote place that you've never heard of. I just want to end by saying that technology is absolutely critical to managing our planet  but even more important is the understanding and wisdom to apply it. Thank you. Sarge Salman  All the way from Los Altos Hills  California  Mr. Henry Evans. Henry Evans  Hello. My name is Henry Evans  and until August           I was living my version of the American dream. I grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis. My dad was a lawyer. My mom was a homemaker. My six siblings and I were good kids  but caused our fair share of trouble. After high school  I left home to study and learn more about the world. I went to Notre Dame University and graduated with degrees in accounting and German  including spending a year of study in Austria. Later on  I earned an MBA at Stanford. I married my high school sweetheart  Jane. I am lucky to have her. Together  we raised four wonderful children. I worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder  eventually becoming a chief financial officer in Silicon Valley  a job I really enjoyed. My family and I bought our first and only home on December           a fixer upper in a beautiful spot of Los Altos Hills  California  from where I am speaking to you now. We were looking forward to rebuilding it  but eight months after we moved in  I suffered a stroke like attack caused by a birth defect. Overnight  I became a mute quadriplegic at the ripe old age of   . It took me several years  but with the help of an incredibly supportive family  I finally decided life was still worth living. I became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled. Head tracking devices sold commercially by the company Madentec convert my tiny head movements into cursor movements  and enable my use of a regular computer. I can surf the web  exchange email with people  and routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins in online word games. This technology allows me to remain engaged  mentally active  and feel like I am a part of the world. One day  I was lying in bed watching CNN  when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech demonstrating a PR  robot. I emailed Charlie and Steve Cousins of Willow Garage  and we formed the Robots for Humanity project. For about two years  Robots for Humanity developed ways for me to use the PR  as my body surrogate. I shaved myself for the first time in    years. From my home in California  I shaved Charlie in Atlanta.  Laughter  I handed out Halloween candy. I opened my refrigerator on my own. I began doing tasks around the house. I saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities to live and contribute  both for myself and others in my circumstance. All of us have disabilities in one form or another. For example  if either of us wants to go    miles an hour  both of us will need an assistive device called a car. Your disability doesn't make you any less of a person  and neither does mine. By the way  check out my sweet ride.  Laughter  Since birth  we have both suffered from the inability to fly on our own. Last year  Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage connected with me Chad Jenkins. Chad showed me how easy it is to purchase and fly aerial drones. It was then I realized that I could also use an aerial drone to expand the worlds of bedridden people through flight  giving a sense of movement and control that is incredible. Using a mouse cursor I control with my head  these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser. With a little practice  I became good enough with this interface to drive around my home on my own. I could look around our garden and see the grapes we are growing. I inspected the solar panels on our roof.  Laughter  One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop. I went even further by seeing if I could use a head mounted display  the Oculus Rift  as modified by Fighting Walrus  to have an immersive experience controlling the drone. With Chad's group at Brown  I regularly fly drones around his lab several times a week  from my home       miles away. All work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic  so we also find time to play friendly games of robot soccer.  Laughter  I never thought I would be able to casually move around a campus like Brown on my own. I just wish I could afford the tuition.  Laughter  Chad Jenkins  Henry  all joking aside  I bet all of these people here would love to see you fly this drone from your bed in California       miles away. Okay  Henry  have you been to D.C. lately  Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic  Can you show us how excited you are  All right  big finish. Can you show us how good of a pilot you are  All right  we still have a little ways to go with that  but I think it shows the promise. What makes Henry's story amazing is it's about understanding Henry's needs  understanding what people in Henry's situation need from technology  and then also understanding what advanced technology can provide  and then bringing those two things together for use in a wise and responsible way. What we're trying to do is democratize robotics  so that anybody can be a part of this. We're providing affordable  off the shelf robot platforms such as the A.R. drone      dollars  the Suitable Technologies beam  only        dollars  along with open source robotics software so that you can be a part of what we're trying to do. And our hope is that  by providing these tools  that you'll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled  to provide care for our aging population  to help better educate our children  to think about what the new types of middle class jobs could be for the future  to both monitor and protect our environment  and to explore the universe. Back to you  Henry. HE  Thank you  Chad. With this drone setup  we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world  and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination  where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else  and perhaps better  and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables. One hundred years ago  I would have been treated like a vegetable. Actually  that's not true. I would have died. It is up to us  all of us  to decide how robotics will be used  for good or for evil  for simply replacing people or for making people better  for allowing us to do and enjoy more. Our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone's mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe. With the help of people like you  we can make this dream a reality. Thank you. One billion people in the world today do not have access to all season roads. One billion people. One seventh of the Earth's population are totally cut off for some part of the year. We cannot get medicine to them reliably  they cannot get critical supplies  and they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income. In sub Saharan Africa  for instance     percent of roads are unusable in the wet season. Investments are being made  but at the current level  it's estimated it's going to take them    years to catch up. In the U.S. alone  there's more than four million miles of roads  very expensive to build  very expensive to maintain infrastructure  with a huge ecological footprint  and yet  very often  congested. So we saw this and we thought  can there be a better way  Can we create a system using today's most advanced technologies that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog in the same way they've done with mobile telephones in the last    years  Many of those nations have excellent telecommunications today without ever putting copper lines in the ground. Could we do the same for transportation  Imagine this scenario. Imagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali  and have a newborn in need of urgent medication. What would you do today  Well  you would place a request via mobile phone  and someone would get the request immediately. That's the part that works. The medication may take days to arrive  though  because of bad roads. That's the part that's broken. We believe we can deliver it within hours with an electric autonomous flying vehicle such as this. This can transport a small payload today  about two kilograms  over a short distance  about    kilometers  but it's part of a wider network that may cover the entire country  maybe even the entire continent. It's an ultra flexible  automated logistics network. It's a network for a transportation of matter. We call it Matternet. We use three key technologies. The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles. The second is automated ground stations that the vehicles fly in and out of to swap batteries and fly farther  or pick up or deliver loads. And the third is the operating system that manages the whole network. Let's look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail. First of all  the UAVs. Eventually  we're going to be using all sorts of vehicles for different payload capacities and different ranges. Today  we're using small quads. These are able to transport two kilograms over    kilometers in just about    minutes. Compare this with trying to trespass a bad road in the developing world  or even being stuck in traffic in a developed world country. These fly autonomously. This is the key to the technology. So they use GPS and other sensors on board to navigate between ground stations. Every vehicle is equipped with an automatic payload and battery exchange mechanism  so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations  they dock  swap a battery automatically  and go out again. The ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground. They secure the most vulnerable part of the mission  which is the landing. They are at known locations on the ground  so the paths between them are also known  which is very important from a reliability perspective from the whole network. Apart from fulfilling the energy requirements of the vehicles  eventually they're going to be becoming commercial hubs where people can take out loads or put loads into the network. The last component is the operating system that manages the whole network. It monitors weather data from all the ground stations and optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system to avoid adverse weather conditions  avoid other risk factors  and optimize the use of the resources throughout the network. I want to show you what one of those flights looks like. Here we are flying in Haiti last summer  where we've done our first field trials. We're modeling here a medical delivery in a camp we set up after the      earthquake. People there love this. And I want to show you what one of those vehicles looks like up close. So this is a        vehicle. Costs are coming down very rapidly. We use this in all sorts of weather conditions  very hot and very cold climates  very strong winds. They're very sturdy vehicles. Imagine if your life depended on this package  somewhere in Africa or in New York City  after Sandy. The next big question is  what's the cost  Well  it turns out that the cost to transport two kilograms over    kilometers with this vehicle is just    cents. And it's counterintuitive  but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today  and we're just at the beginning of this. When we saw this  we felt that this is something that can have significant impact in the world. So we said  okay  how much does it cost to set up a network somewhere in the world  And we looked at setting up a network in Lesotho for transportation of HIV AIDS samples. The problem there is how do you take them from clinics where they're being collected to hospitals where they're being analyzed  And we said  what if we wanted to cover an area spanning around     square kilometers  That's roughly one and a half times the size of Manhattan. Well it turns out that the cost to do that there would be less than a million dollars. Compare this to normal infrastructure investments. We think this can be    this is the power of a new paradigm. So here we are  a new idea about a network for transportation that is based on the ideas of the Internet. It's decentralized  it's peer to peer  it's bidirectional  highly adaptable  with very low infrastructure investment  very low ecological footprint. If it is a new paradigm  though  there must be other uses for it. It can be used perhaps in other places in the world. So let's look at the other end of the spectrum  our cities and megacities. Half of the Earth's population lives in cities today. Half a billion of us live in megacities. We are living through an amazing urbanization trend. China alone is adding a megacity the size of New York City every two years. These are places that do have road infrastructure  but it's very inefficient. Congestion is a huge problem. So we think it makes sense in those places to set up a network of transportation that is a new layer that sits between the road and the Internet  initially for lightweight  urgent stuff  and over time  we would hope to develop this into a new mode of transportation that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem. It's ultimately scalable with a very small ecological footprint  operating in the background       just like the Internet. So when we started this a couple of years ago now  we've had a lot of people come up to us who said   This is a very interesting but crazy idea  and certainly not something that you should engage with anytime soon.  And of course  we're talking about drones  right  a technology that's not only unpopular in the West but one that has become a very  very unpleasant fact of life for many living in poor countries  especially those engaged in conflict. So why are we doing this  Well  we chose to do this one not because it's easy  but because it can have amazing impact. Imagine one billion people being connected to physical goods in the same way that mobile telecommunications connected them to information. Imagine if the next big network we built in the world was a network for the transportation of matter. In the developing world  we would hope to reach millions of people with better vaccines  reach them with better medication. It would give us an unfair advantage against battling HIV AIDS  tuberculosis and other epidemics. Over time  we would hope it would become a new platform for economic transactions  lifting millions of people out of poverty. In the developed world and the emerging world  we would hope it would become a new mode of transportation that could help make our cities more livable. So for those that still believe that this is science fiction  I firmly say to you that it is not. We do need to engage  though  in social fiction to make it happen. Thank you. So yesterday  I was out in the street in front of this building  and I was walking down the sidewalk  and I had company  several of us  and we were all abiding by the rules of walking down sidewalks. We're not talking each other. We're facing forward. We're moving. When the person in front of me slows down. And so I'm watching him  and he slows down  and finally he stops. Well  that wasn't fast enough for me  so I put on my turn signal  and I walked around him  and as I walked  I looked to see what he was doing  and he was doing this. He was texting  and he couldn't text and walk at the same time. Now we could approach this from a working memory perspective or from a multitasking perspective. We're going to do working memory today. Now  working memory is that part of our consciousness that we are aware of at any given time of day. You're going it right now. It's not something we can turn off. If you turn it off  that's called a coma  okay  So right now  you're doing just fine. Now working memory has four basic components. It allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge. It allows us to reach back into our long term memory and pull some of that in as we need it  mixes it  processes it in light of whatever our current goal is. Now the current goal isn't something like  I want to be president or the best surfer in the world. It's more mundane. I'd like that cookie  or I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room. Now working memory capacity is our ability to leverage that  our ability to take what we know and what we can hang onto and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy our current goal. Now working memory capacity has a fairly long history  and it's associated with a lot of positive effects. People with high working memory capacity tend to be good storytellers. They tend to solve and do well on standardized tests  however important that is. They're able to have high levels of writing ability. They're also able to reason at high levels. So what we're going to do here is play a little bit with some of that. So I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks  and we're going to take your  working memory out for a ride. You up for that  Okay. I'm going to give you five words  and I just want you to hang on to them. Don't write them down. Just hang on to them. Five words. While you're hanging on to them  I'm going to ask you to answer three questions. I want to see what happens with those words. So here's the words  tree  highway  mirror  Saturn and electrode. So far so good  Okay. What I want you to do is I want you to tell me what the answer is to    times eight. Just shout it out. In fact it's     Mumbling     exactly.  Laughter  All right. I want you to take out your left hand and I want you to go   One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine    .  It's a neurological test  just in case you were wondering. All right  now what I want you to do is to recite the last five letters of the English alphabet backwards. You should have started with Z. All right. How many people here are still pretty sure you've got all five words  Okay. Typically we end up with about less than half  right  which is normal. There will be a range. Some people can hang on to five. Some people can hang on to   . Some will be down to two or three. What we know is this is really important to the way we function  right  And it's going to be really important here at TED because you're going to be exposed to so many different ideas. Now the problem that we have is that life comes at us  and it comes at us very quickly  and what we need to do is to take that amorphous flow of experience and somehow extract meaning from it with a working memory that's about the size of a pea. Now don't get me wrong  working memory is awesome. Working memory allows us to investigate our current experience as we move forward. It allows us to make sense of the world around us. But it does have certain limits. Now working memory is great for allowing us to communicate. We can have a conversation  and I can build a narrative around that so I know where we've been and where we're going and how to contribute to this conversation. It allows us to problem solve  critical think. We can be in the middle of a meeting  listen to somebody's presentation  evaluate it  decide whether or not we like it  ask follow up questions. All of that occurs within working memory. It also allows us to go to the store and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese when what we're really looking for is Red Bull and bacon.  Laughter  Gotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for. Now  a central issue with working memory is that it's limited. It's limited in capacity  limited in duration  limited in focus. We tend to remember about four things. Okay  It used to be seven  but with functional MRIs  apparently it's four  and we were overachieving. Now we can remember those four things for about    to    seconds unless we do something with it  unless we process it  unless we apply it to something  unless we talk to somebody about it. When we think about working memory  we have to realize that this limited capacity has lots of different impacts on us. Have you ever walked from one room to another and then forgotten why you're there  You do know the solution to that  right  You go back to that original room.  Laughter  Have you ever forgotten your keys  You ever forgotten your car  You ever forgotten your kids  Have you ever been involved in a conversation  and you realize that the conversation to your left is actually more interesting   Laughter  So you're nodding and you're smiling  but you're really paying attention to this one over here  until you hear that last word go up  and you realize  you've been asked a question.  Laughter  And you're really hoping the answer is no  because that's what you're about to say. All of that talks about working memory  what we can do and what we can't do. We need to realize that working memory has a limited capacity  and that working memory capacity itself is how we negotiate that. We negotiate that through strategies. So what I want to do is talk a little bit about a couple of strategies here  and these will be really important because you are now in an information target rich environment for the next several days. Now the first part of this that we need to think about and we need to process our existence  our life  immediately and repeatedly. We need to process what's going on the moment it happens  not    minutes later  not a week later  at the moment. So we need to think about  well  do I agree with him  What's missing  What would I like to know  Do I agree with the assumptions  How can I apply this in my life  It's a way of processing what's going on so that we can use it later. Now we also need to repeat it. We need to practice. So we need to think about it here. In between  we want to talk to people about it. We're going to write it down  and when you get home  pull out those notes and think about them and end up practicing over time. Practice for some reason became a very negative thing. It's very positive. The next thing is  we need to think elaboratively and we need to think illustratively. Oftentimes  we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge. What we want to do is spin that around. We want to take all of our existence and wrap it around that new knowledge and make all of these connections and it becomes more meaningful. We also want to use imagery. We are built for images. We need to take advantage of that. Think about things in images  write things down that way. If you read a book  pull things up. I just got through reading  The Great Gatsby   and I have a perfect idea of what he looks like in my head  so my own version. The last one is organization and support. We are meaning making machines. It's what we do. We try to make meaning out of everything that happens to us. Organization helps  so we need to structure what we're doing in ways that make sense. If we are providing knowledge and experience  we need to structure that. And the last one is support. We all started as novices. Everything we do is an approximation of sophistication. We should expect it to change over time. We have to support that. The support may come in asking people questions  giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it or has some guiding images  but we need to support it. Now  the final piece of this  the take home message from a working memory capacity standpoint is this  what we process  we learn. If we're not processing life  we're not living it. Live life. Thank you. To give me an idea of how many of you here may find what I'm about to tell you of practical value  let me ask you please to raise your hands  Who here is either over    years old or hopes to live past age    or has parents or grandparents who did live or have lived past     raise your hands please.  Laughter  Okay. You are the people to whom my talk will be of practical value.  Laughter  The rest of you won't find my talk personally relevant  but I think that you will still find the subject fascinating. I'm going to talk about growing older in traditional societies. This subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book  which compares traditional  small  tribal societies with our large  modern societies  with respect to many topics such as bringing up children  growing older  health  dealing with danger  settling disputes  religion and speaking more than one language. Those tribal societies  which constituted all human societies for most of human history  are far more diverse than are our modern  recent  big societies. All big societies that have governments  and where most people are strangers to each other  are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies. Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments in how to run a human society. They constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn. Tribal societies shouldn't be scorned as primitive and miserable  but also they shouldn't be romanticized as happy and peaceful. When we learn of tribal practices  some of them will horrify us  but there are other tribal practices which  when we hear about them  we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves. Most old people in the U.S. end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years  and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly  whereas in traditional societies  older people instead live out their lives among their children  their other relatives  and their lifelong friends. Nevertheless  the treatment of the elderly varies enormously among traditional societies  from much worse to much better than in our modern societies. At the worst extreme  many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways  by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die  or by abandoning them when the group moves  or by encouraging older people to commit suicide  or by killing older people. In which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents  It happens mainly under two conditions. One is in nomadic  hunter gather societies that often shift camp and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who can't walk when the able bodied younger people already have to carry their young children and all their physical possessions. The other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctuating environments  such as the Arctic or deserts  where there are periodic food shortages  and occasionally there just isn't enough food to keep everyone alive. Whatever food is available has to be reserved for able bodied adults and for children. To us Americans  it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father  but what could those traditional societies do differently  They face a cruel situation of no choice. Their old people had to do it to their own parents  and the old people know what now is going to happen to them. At the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly  the happy extreme  are the New Guinea farming societies where I've been doing my fieldwork  for the past    years  and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world. In those societies  older people are cared for. They are fed. They remain valuable. And they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children  relatives and lifelong friends. There are two main sets of reasons for this variation among societies in their treatment of old people. The variation depends especially on the usefulness of old people and on the society's values. First  as regards usefulness  older people continue to perform useful services. One use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food. Another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren  thereby freeing up their own adult children  the parents of those grandchildren  to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren. Still another traditional value of older people is in making tools  weapons  baskets  pots and textiles. In fact  they're usually the people who are best at it. Older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies  and the people most knowledgeable about politics  medicine  religion  songs and dances. Finally  older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern  literate societies  where our sources of information are books and the Internet. In contrast  in traditional societies without writing  older people are the repositories of information. It's their knowledge that spells the difference between survival and death for their whole society in a time of crisis caused by rare events for which only the oldest people alive have had experience. Those  then  are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies. Their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the society's treatment of the elderly. The other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the society's cultural values. For example  there's particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in East Asia  associated with Confucius' doctrine of filial piety  which means obedience  respect and support for elderly parents. Cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the U.S. Older Americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications. They're at a big disadvantage in hospitals. Our hospitals have an explicit policy called age based allocation of healthcare resources. That sinister expression means that if hospital resources are limited  for example if only one donor heart becomes available for transplant  or if a surgeon has time to operate on only a certain number of patients  American hospitals have an explicit policy of giving preference to younger patients over older patients on the grounds that younger patients are considered more valuable to society because they have more years of life ahead of them  even though the younger patients have fewer years of valuable life experience behind them. There are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the U.S. One is our Protestant work ethic which places high value on work  so older people who are no longer working aren't respected. Another reason is our American emphasis on the virtues of self reliance and independence  so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self reliant and independent. Still a third reason is our American cult of youth  which shows up even in our advertisements. Ads for Coca Cola and beer always depict smiling young people  even though old as well as young people buy and drink Coca Cola and beer. Just think  what's the last time you saw a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people    years old  Never. Instead  the only American ads featuring white haired old people are ads for retirement homes and pension planning. Well  what has changed in the status of the elderly today compared to their status in traditional societies  There have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse. Big changes for the better include the fact that today we enjoy much longer lives  much better health in our old age  and much better recreational opportunities. Another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people. Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past. That means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people  and that each old person has less individual value. Another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly is the breaking of social ties with age  because older people  their children  and their friends  all move and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives. We Americans move on the average every five years. Hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth. Yet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly is formal retirement from the workforce  carrying with it a loss of work friendships and a loss of the self esteem associated with work. Perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are objectively less useful than in traditional societies. Widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge. When we want some information  we look it up in a book or we Google it instead of finding some old person to ask. The slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old  but the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful    years later. And conversely  we older people are not fluent in the technologies essential for surviving in modern society. For example  as a    year old  I was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers because I had memorized the multiplication tables and I know how to use logarithms and I'm quick at manipulating a slide rule. Today  though  those skills are utterly useless because any idiot can now multiply eight digit numbers accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator. Conversely  I at age    am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life. My family's first TV set in      had only three knobs that I quickly mastered  an on off switch  a volume knob  and a channel selector knob. Today  just to watch a program on the TV set in my own house  I have to operate a    button TV remote that utterly defeats me. I have to telephone my    year old sons and ask them to talk me through it while I try to push those wretched    buttons. What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the U.S.  and to make better use of their value  That's a huge problem. In my remaining four minutes today  I can offer just a few suggestions. One value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high quality childcare to their grandchildren  if they choose to do it  as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full time caretakers of their children. Compared to the usual alternatives of paid babysitters and day care centers  grandparents offer superior  motivated  experienced child care. They've already gained experience from raising their own children. They usually love their grandchildren  and are eager to spend time with them. Unlike other caregivers  grandparents don't quit their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby. A second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology. At the same time  older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change  but that could come back. For example  only Americans now in their   s or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression  the experience of living through a world war  and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs. Most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things  but millions of older Americans do. Unfortunately  all of those terrible situations could come back. Even if they don't come back  we have to be able to plan for them on the basis of the experience of what they were like. Older people have that experience. Younger people don't. The remaining value of older people that I'll mention involves recognizing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do  there are other things that they can do better than younger people. A challenge for society is  to make use of those things that older people are better at doing. Some abilities  of course  decrease with age. Those include abilities at tasks requiring physical strength and stamina  ambition  and the power of novel reasoning in a circumscribed situation  such as figuring out the structure of DNA  best left to scientists under the age of   . Conversely  valuable attributes that increase with age include experience  understanding of people and human relationships  ability to help other people without your own ego getting in the way  and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases  such as economics and comparative history  best left to scholars over the age of   . Hence older people are much better than younger people at supervising  administering  advising  strategizing  teaching  synthesizing  and devising long term plans. I've seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their   s    s    s and   s  who are still active as investment managers  farmers  lawyers and doctors. In short  many traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern  big societies. Paradoxically nowadays  when we have more elderly people than ever before  living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before  old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before. The lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern American society. We can surely do better by learning from the lives of the elderly in traditional societies. But what's true of the lives of the elderly in traditional societies is true of many other features of traditional societies as well. Of course  I'm not advocating that we all give up agriculture and metal tools and return to a hunter gatherer lifestyle. There are many obvious respects in which our lives today are far happier than those in small  traditional societies. To mention just a few examples  our lives are longer  materially much richer  and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies. But there are also things to be admired about people in traditional societies  and perhaps to be learned from them. Their lives are usually socially much richer than our lives  although materially poorer. Their children are more self confident  more independent  and more socially skilled than are our children. They think more realistically about dangers than we do. They almost never die of diabetes  heart disease  stroke  and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today. Features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases  and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them. Those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies. I hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as I found it to live in those societies. Thank you. What is so special about the human brain  Why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us  What does a human brain have or do that no other brain does  When I became interested in these questions about    years ago  scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of. Though it was based on very little evidence  many scientists thought that all mammalian brains  including the human brain  were made in the same way  with a number of neurons that was always proportional to the size of the brain. This means that two brains of the same size  like these two  with a respectable     grams  should have similar numbers of neurons. Now  if neurons are the functional information processing units of the brain  then the owners of these two brains should have similar cognitive abilities. And yet  one is a chimp  and the other is a cow. Now maybe cows have a really rich internal mental life and are so smart that they choose not to let us realize it  but we eat them. I think most people will agree that chimps are capable of much more complex  elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are. So this is a first indication that the  all brains are made the same way  scenario is not quite right. But let's play along. If all brains were made the same way and you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes  larger brains should always have more neurons than smaller brains  and the larger the brain  the more cognitively able its owner should be. So the largest brain around should also be the most cognitively able. And here comes the bad news  Our brain  not the largest one around. It seems quite vexing. Our brain weighs between  .  and  .  kilos  but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos  and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos  which is why scientists used to resort to saying that our brain must be special to explain our cognitive abilities. It must be really extraordinary  an exception to the rule. Theirs may be bigger  but ours is better  and it could be better  for example  in that it seems larger than it should be  with a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have for the size of our bodies. So that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body. That's because the size of the brain usually follows the size of the body. So the main reason for saying that our brain is larger than it should be actually comes from comparing ourselves to great apes. Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are  so their brains should also be larger than ours  but instead it's the other way around. Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain. The human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses. Although it weighs only two percent of the body  it alone uses    percent of all the energy that your body requires to run per day. That's     calories out of a total of       calories  just to keep your brain working. So the human brain is larger than it should be  it uses much more energy than it should  so it's special. And this is where the story started to bother me. In biology  we look for rules that apply to all animals and to life in general  so why should the rules of evolution apply to everybody else but not to us  Maybe the problem was with the basic assumption that all brains are made in the same way. Maybe two brains of a similar size can actually be made of very different numbers of neurons. Maybe a very large brain does not necessarily have more neurons than a more modest sized brain. Maybe the human brain  actually has the most neurons of any brain  regardless of its size  especially in the cerebral cortex. So this to me became the important question to answer  how many neurons does the human brain have  and how does that compare to other animals  Now  you may have heard or read somewhere that we have     billion neurons  so    years ago  I asked my colleagues if they knew where this number came from. But nobody did. I've been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number  and I could never find it. It seems that nobody had actually ever counted the number of neurons in the human brain  or in any other brain for that matter. So I came up with my own way to count cells in the brain  and it essentially consists of dissolving that brain into soup. It works like this  You take a brain  or parts of that brain  and you dissolve it in detergent  which destroys the cell membranes but keeps the cell nuclei intact  so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei that looks like this  like a clear soup. This soup contains all the nuclei that once were a mouse brain. Now  the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup  you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid  so that now by looking under the microscope at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution  you can count nuclei  and therefore tell how many cells that brain had. It's simple  it's straightforward  and it's really fast. So we've used that method to count neurons in dozens of different species so far  and it turns out that all brains are not made the same way. Take rodents and primates  for instance  In larger rodent brains  the average size of the neuron increases  so the brain inflates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains neurons. But primate brains gain neurons without the average neuron becoming any larger  which is a very economical way to add neurons to your brain. The result is that a primate brain will always have more neurons than a rodent brain of the same size  and the larger the brain  the larger this difference will be. Well  what about our brain then  We found that we have  on average     billion neurons     billion of which are in the cerebral cortex  and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of functions like awareness and logical and abstract reasoning  and that    billion is the most neurons that any cortex has  I think this is the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities. But just as important is what the    billion neurons mean. Because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically  we could calculate what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain. So  a rodent brain with    billion neurons would weigh    kilos. That's not possible. A brain that huge would be crushed by its own weight  and this impossible brain would go in the body of    tons. I don't think it looks like us. So this brings us to a very important conclusion already  which is that we are not rodents. The human brain is not a large rat brain. Compared to a rat  we might seem special  yes  but that's not a fair comparison to make  given that we know that we are not rodents. We are primates  so the correct comparison is to other primates. And there  if you do the math  you find that a generic primate with    billion neurons would have a brain of about  .  kilos  which seems just right  in a body of some    kilos  which in my case is exactly right  which brings us to a very unsurprising but still incredibly important conclusion  I am a primate. And all of you are primates. And so was Darwin. I love to think that Darwin would have really appreciated this. His brain  like ours  was made in the image of other primate brains. So the human brain may be remarkable  yes  but it is not special in its number of neurons. It is just a large primate brain. I think that's a very humbling and sobering thought that should remind us of our place in nature. Why does it cost so much energy  then  Well  other people have figured out how much energy the human brain and that of other species costs  and now that we knew how many neurons each brain was made of  we could do the math. And it turns out that both human and other brains cost about the same  an average of six calories  per billion neurons per day. So the total energetic cost of a brain is a simple  linear function of its number of neurons  and it turns out that the human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect. So the reason why the human brain costs so much energy is simply because it has a huge number of neurons  and because we are primates with many more neurons for a given body size than any other animal  the relative cost of our brain is large  but just because we're primates  not because we're special. Last question  then  how did we come by this remarkable number of neurons  and in particular  if great apes are larger than we are  why don't they have a larger brain  than we do  with more neurons  When we realized how much expensive it is to have a lot of neurons in the brain  I figured  maybe there's a simple reason. They just can't afford the energy for both a large body  and a large number of neurons. So we did the math. We calculated on the one hand how much energy a primate gets per day from eating raw foods  and on the other hand  how much energy a body of a certain size costs and how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs  and we looked for the combinations of body size and number of brain neurons that a primate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day. And what we found is that because neurons are so expensive  there is a tradeoff between body size and number of neurons. So a primate that eats eight hours per day can afford at most    billion neurons  but then its body cannot be any bigger than    kilos. To weigh any more than that  it has to give up neurons. So it's either a large body or a large number of neurons. When you eat like a primate  you can't afford both. One way out of this metabolic limitation would be to spend even more hours per day eating  but that gets dangerous  and past a certain point  it's just not possible. Gorillas and orangutans  for instance  afford about    billion neurons by spending eight and a half hours per day eating  and that seems to be about as much as they can do. Nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate. What about us  With our    billion neurons and    to    kilos of body mass  we should have to spend over nine hours per day every single day feeding  which is just not feasible. If we ate like a primate  we should not be here. How did we get here  then  Well  if our brain costs just as much energy as it should  and if we can't spend every waking hour of the day feeding  then the only alternative  really  is to somehow get more energy out of the same foods. And remarkably  that matches exactly what our ancestors are believed to have invented one and a half million years ago  when they invented cooking. To cook is to use fire to pre digest foods outside of your body. Cooked foods are softer  so they're easier to chew and to turn completely into mush in your mouth  so that allows them to be completely digested and absorbed in your gut  which makes them yield much more energy in much less time. So cooking frees time for us to do much more interesting things with our day and with our neurons than just thinking about food  looking for food  and gobbling down food all day long. So because of cooking  what once was a major liability  this large  dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons  could now become a major asset  now that we could both afford  the energy for a lot of neurons and the time to do interesting things with them. So I think this explains why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution  all of the while remaining just a primate brain. With this large brain now affordable by cooking  we went rapidly from raw foods to culture  agriculture  civilization  grocery stores  electricity  refrigerators  all of those things that nowadays allow us to get all the energy we need for the whole day in a single sitting at your favorite fast food joint. So what once was a solution now became the problem  and ironically  we look for the solution in raw food. So what is the human advantage  What is it that we have that no other animal has  My answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex  and I think that's the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities. And what is it that we do that no other animal does  and which I believe was fundamental to allow us to reach that large  largest number of neurons in the cortex  In two words  we cook. No other animal cooks its food. Only humans do. And I think that's how we got to become human. Studying the human brain changed  the way I think about food. I now look at my kitchen  and I bow to it  and I thank my ancestors for coming up with the invention that probably made us humans. Thank you very much. There is something you know about me  something very personal  and there is something I know about every one of you and that's very central to your concerns. There is something that we know about everyone we meet anywhere in the world  on the street  that is the very mainspring of whatever they do and whatever they put up with. And that is that all of us want to be happy. In this  we are all together. How we imagine our happiness  that differs from one another  but it's already a lot that we have all in common  that we want to be happy. Now my topic is gratefulness. What is the connection between happiness and gratefulness  Many people would say  well  that's very easy. When you are happy  you are grateful. But think again. Is it really the happy people that are grateful  We all know quite a number of people who have everything that it would take to be happy  and they are not happy  because they want something else or they want more of the same. And we all know people who have lots of misfortune  misfortune that we ourselves would not want to have  and they are deeply happy. They radiate happiness. You are surprised. Why  Because they are grateful. So it is not happiness that makes us grateful. It's gratefulness that makes us happy. If you think it's happiness that makes you grateful  think again. It's gratefulness that makes you happy. Now  we can ask  what do we really mean by gratefulness  And how does it work  I appeal to your own experience. We all know from experience how it goes. We experience something that's valuable to us. Something is given to us that's valuable to us. And it's really given. These two things have to come together. It has to be something valuable  and it's a real gift. You haven't bought it. You haven't earned it. You haven't traded it in. You haven't worked for it. It's just given to you. And when these two things come together  something that's really valuable to me and I realize it's freely given  then gratefulness spontaneously rises in my heart  happiness spontaneously rises in my heart. That's how gratefulness happens. Now the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this once in a while. We cannot only have grateful experiences. We can be people who live gratefully. Grateful living  that is the thing. And how can we live gratefully  By experiencing  by becoming aware that every moment is a given moment  as we say. It's a gift. You haven't earned it. You haven't brought it about in any way. You have no way of assuring that there will be another moment given to you  and yet  that's the most valuable thing that can ever be given to us  this moment  with all the opportunity that it contains. If we didn't have this present moment  we wouldn't have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything  and this moment is a gift. It's a given moment  as we say. Now  we say the gift within this gift is really the opportunity. What you are really grateful for is the opportunity  not the thing that is given to you  because if that thing were somewhere else and you didn't have the opportunity to enjoy it  to do something with it  you wouldn't be grateful for it. Opportunity is the gift within every gift  and we have this saying  opportunity knocks only once. Well  think again. Every moment is a new gift  over and over again  and if you miss the opportunity of this moment  another moment is given to us  and another moment. We can avail ourselves of this opportunity  or we can miss it  and if we avail ourselves of the opportunity  it is the key to happiness. Behold the master key to our happiness in our own hands. Moment by moment  we can be grateful for this gift. Does that mean that we can be grateful for everything  Certainly not. We cannot be grateful for violence  for war  for oppression  for exploitation. On the personal level  we cannot be grateful for the loss of a friend  for unfaithfulness  for bereavement. But I didn't say we can be grateful for everything. I said we can be grateful in every given moment for the opportunity  and even when we are confronted with something that is terribly difficult  we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity that is given to us. It isn't as bad as it might seem. Actually  when you look at it and experience it  you find that most of the time  what is given to us is the opportunity to enjoy  and we only miss it because we are rushing through life and we are not stopping to see the opportunity. But once in a while  something very difficult is given to us  and when this difficult thing occurs to us  it's a challenge to rise to that opportunity  and we can rise to it by learning something which is sometimes painful. Learning patience  for instance. We have been told that the road to peace is not a sprint  but is more like a marathon. That takes patience. That's difficult. It may be to stand up for your opinion  to stand up for your conviction. That's an opportunity that is given to us. To learn  to suffer  to stand up  all these opportunities are given to us  but they are opportunities  and those who avail themselves of those opportunities are the ones that we admire. They make something out of life. And those who fail get another opportunity. We always get another opportunity. That's the wonderful richness of life. So how can we find a method that will harness this  How can each one of us find a method for living gratefully  not just once in a while being grateful  but moment by moment to be grateful. How can we do it  It's a very simple method. It's so simple that it's actually what we were told as children when we learned to cross the street. Stop. Look. Go. That's all. But how often do we stop  We rush through life. We don't stop. We miss the opportunity because we don't stop. We have to stop. We have to get quiet. And we have to build stop signs into our lives. When I was in Africa some years ago and then came back  I noticed water. In Africa where I was  I didn't have drinkable water. Every time I turned on the faucet  I was overwhelmed. Every time I clicked on the light  I was so grateful. It made me so happy. But after a while  this wears off. So I put little stickers on the light switch and on the water faucet  and every time I turned it on  water. So leave it up to your own imagination. You can find whatever works best for you  but you need stop signs in your life. And when you stop  then the next thing is to look. You look. You open your eyes. You open your ears. You open your nose. You open all your senses for this wonderful richness that is given to us. There is no end to it  and that is what life is all about  to enjoy  to enjoy what is given to us. And then we can also open our hearts  our hearts for the opportunities  for the opportunities also to help others  to make others happy  because nothing makes us more happy than when all of us are happy. And when we open our hearts to the opportunities  the opportunities invite us to do something  and that is the third. Stop  look  and then go  and really do something. And what we can do is whatever life offers to you in that present moment. Mostly it's the opportunity to enjoy  but sometimes it's something more difficult. But whatever it is  if we take this opportunity  we go with it  we are creative  those are the creative people. And that little stop  look  go  is such a potent seed that it can revolutionize our world. Because we are at the present moment in the middle of a change of consciousness  and you will be surprised if you    I am always surprised when I hear how many times this word  gratefulness  and  gratitude  comes up. Everywhere you find it  a grateful airline  a restaurant gratefulness  a caf  gratefulness  a wine that is gratefulness. Yes  I have even come across a toilet paper whose brand is called  Thank You.  There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware how important this is and how this can change our world. It can change our world in immensely important ways  because if you're grateful  you're not fearful  and if you're not fearful  you're not violent. If you're grateful  you act out of a sense of enough and not of a sense of scarcity  and you are willing to share. If you are grateful  you are enjoying the differences between people  and you are respectful to everybody  and that changes this power pyramid under which we live. And it doesn't make for equality  but it makes for equal respect  and that is the important thing. The future of the world will be a network  not a pyramid turned upside down. The revolution of which I am speaking is a nonviolent revolution  and it's so revolutionary that it even revolutionizes the very concept of a revolution  because the normal revolution is one where the power pyramid is turned upside down and those who were on the bottom are now on the top and are doing exactly the same thing that the ones before. What we need is a networking of smaller groups  smaller and smaller groups who know one another  who interact with one another  and that is a grateful world. A grateful world is a world of joyful people. Grateful people are joyful people  and joyful people    the more and more joyful people there are  the more and more we'll have a joyful world. We have a network for grateful living  and it has mushroomed. We couldn't understand why it mushroomed. We have an opportunity for people to light a candle when they are grateful for something. And there have been    million candles lit in one decade. People are becoming aware that a grateful world is a happy world  and we all have the opportunity by the simple stop  look  go  to transform the world  to make it a happy place. And that is what I hope for us  and if this has contributed a little to making you want to do the same  stop  look  go. Thank you. I'm here today to talk about social change  not a new therapy or a new intervention or a new way of working with kids or something like that  but a new business model for social change  a new way of tackling the problem. In Britain     percent of all men who come out of short sentences from prison re offend again within a year. Now how many previous offenses do you think they have on average managed to commit  Forty three. And how many previous times do you think they've been in prison  Seven. So we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice  and we said to the Ministry of Justice  what's it worth to you if fewer of these guys re offend  It's got to be worth something  right  I mean  there's prison costs  there's police costs  there's court costs  all these things that you're spending money on to deal with these guys. What's it worth  Now  of course  we care about the social value. Social Finance  the organization I helped set up  cares about social stuff. But we wanted to make the economic case  because if we could make the economic case  then the value of doing this  would be completely compelling. And if we can agree on both a value and a way of measuring whether we've been successful at reducing that re offending  then we can do something we think rather interesting. The idea is called the social impact bond. Now  the social impact bond is simply saying  if we can get the government to agree  that we can create a contract where they only pay if it worked. So that means that they can try out new stuff without the embarrassment of having to pay if it didn't work  which for still quite a lot of bits of government  that's a serious issue. Now  many of you may have noticed there's a problem at this point  and that is that it takes a long time to measure whether those outcomes have happened. So we have to raise some money. We use the contract to raise money from socially motivated investors. Socially motivated investors  there's an interesting idea  right  But actually  there's a lot of people who  if they're given the chance  would love to invest in something that does social good. And here's the opportunity. Do you want to also help government find whether there's a better economic model  not just leaving these guys to come out of prison and waiting till they re offend and putting them back in again  but actually working with them to move to a different path to end up with fewer crimes and fewer victims  So we find some investors  and they pay for a set of services  and if those services are successful  then they improve outcomes  and with those measured reductions in re offending  government saves money  and with those savings  they can pay outcomes. And the investors do not just get their money back  but they make a return. So in March       we signed the first social impact bond with the Ministry of Justice around Peterborough Prison. It was to work with       offenders split into three cohorts of       each. Now  each of those cohorts would get measured over the two years that they were coming out of prison. They've got to have a year to commit their crimes  six months to get through the court system  and then they would be compared to a group taken from the police national computer  as similar as possible  and we would get paid providing we achieved a hurdle rate of    percent reduction  for every conviction event that didn't happen. So we get paid for crimes saved. Now if we achieved that    percent reduction across all three cohorts  then the investors get a seven and a half percent annualized return on their investment  and if we do better than that  they can get up to    percent annualized return on their investment  which is okay. So everyone wins here  right  The Ministry of Justice can try out a new program and they only pay if it works. Investors get two opportunities  for the first time  they can invest in social change. Also  they make a reasonable return  and they also know that first investors in these kinds of things  they're going to have to believers. They're going to have to care in the social program  but if this builds a track record over five or    years  then you can widen that investor community as more people have confidence in the product. The service providers  well  for the first time  they've got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they're doing in a really constructive way and learn and demonstrate the value of what they're doing over five or six years  not just one or two as often happens at the moment. Society wins  fewer crimes  fewer victims. Now  the offenders  they also benefit. Instead of just coming out of the prison with    pounds in their pocket  half of them not knowing where they're spending their first night out of jail  actually  someone meets them in prison  learns about their issues  meets them at the gate  takes them through to somewhere to stay  connects them to benefits  connects them to employment  drug rehabilitation  mental health  whatever's needed. So let's think of another example  working with children in care. Social impact bonds work great for any area where there is at the moment very expensive provision that produces poor outcomes for people. So children in the state care tend to do very badly. Only    percent achieve a reasonable level of five GCSEs at     against    percent of the wider population. More troublingly     percent of offenders in prison have spent some time in care. And even more worryingly  and this is a Home Office statistic     percent of prostitutes have spent some time in care. The state is not a great parent. But there are great programs for adolescents who are on the edge of care  and    percent of kids going into care are adolescents. So we set up a program with Essex County Council to test out intensive family therapeutic support for those families with adolescents on the edge of the care system. Essex only pays in the event that it's saving them care costs. Investors have put in  .  million pounds. That program started last month. Others  around homelessness in London  around youth and employment and education elsewhere in the country. There are now    social impact bonds in Britain  and amazing levels of interest in this idea all over the world. So David Cameron's put    million pounds into a social outcomes fund to support this idea. Obama has suggested     million dollars in the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas and structures to move it forward  and a lot of other countries are demonstrating considerable interest. So what's caused this excitement  Why is this so different for people  Well  the first piece  which we've talked about  is innovation. It enables testing of new ideas in a way that's less difficult for everybody. The second piece it brings is rigor. By working to outcomes  people really have to test and bring data into the situation that one's dealing with. So taking Peterborough as an example  we add case management across all of the different organizations that we're working with so they know what actually has been done with different prisoners  and at the same time they learn from the Ministry of Justice  and we learn  because we pushed for the data  what actually happens  whether they get re arrested or not. And we learn and adapt the program accordingly. And this leads to the third element  which is new  and that's flexibility. Because normal contracting for things  when you're spending government money  you're spending our money  tax money  and the people who are in charge  of that are very aware of it so the temptation is to control exactly how you spend it. Now any entrepreneur in the room knows that version  .   the business plan  is not the one that generally works. So when you're trying to do something like this  you need the flexibility to adapt the program. And again  in Peterborough  we started off with a program  but we also collected data  and over the period of time  we nuanced and changed that program to add a range of other elements  so that the service adapts and we meet the needs of the long term as well as the short term  greater engagement from the prisoners  longer term engagement as well. The last element is partnership. There is  at the moment  a stale  debate going on very often  state's better  public sector's better  private sector's better  social sector's better  for a lot of these programs. Actually  for creating social change  we need to bring in the expertise from all of those parties in order to make this work. And this creates a structure through which they can combine. So where does this leave us  This leaves us with a way that people can invest in social change. We've met thousands  possibly millions of people  who want the opportunity to invest in social change. We've met champions all over the public sector keen to make these kinds of differences. With this kind of model  we can help bring them together. Thank you. We have a global health challenge in our hands today  and that is that the way we currently discover and develop new drugs is too costly  takes far too long  and it fails more often than it succeeds. It really just isn't working  and that means that patients that badly need new therapies are not getting them  and diseases are going untreated. We seem to be spending more and more money. So for every billion dollars we spend in R D  we're getting less drugs approved into the market. More money  less drugs. Hmm. So what's going on here  Well  there's a multitude of factors at play  but I think one of the key factors is that the tools that we currently have available to test whether a drug is going to work  whether it has efficacy  or whether it's going to be safe before we get it into human clinical trials  are failing us. They're not predicting what's going to happen in humans. And we have two main tools available at our disposal. They are cells in dishes and animal testing. Now let's talk about the first one  cells in dishes. So  cells are happily functioning in our bodies. We take them and rip them out of their native environment  throw them in one of these dishes  and expect them to work. Guess what. They don't. They don't like that environment because it's nothing like what they have in the body. What about animal testing  Well  animals do and can provide extremely useful information. They teach us about what happens in the complex organism. We learn more about the biology itself. However  more often than not  animal models fail to predict what will happen in humans when they're treated with a particular drug. So we need better tools. We need human cells  but we need to find a way to keep them happy outside the body. Our bodies are dynamic environments. We're in constant motion. Our cells experience that. They're in dynamic environments in our body. They're under constant mechanical forces. So if we want to make cells happy outside our bodies  we need to become cell architects. We need to design  build and engineer a home away from home for the cells. And at the Wyss Institute  we've done just that. We call it an organ on a chip. And I have one right here. It's beautiful  isn't it  But it's pretty incredible. Right here in my hand is a breathing  living human lung on a chip. And it's not just beautiful. It can do a tremendous amount of things. We have living cells in that little chip  cells that are in a dynamic environment interacting with different cell types. There's been many people trying to grow cells in the lab. They've tried many different approaches. They've even tried to grow little mini organs in the lab. We're not trying to do that here. We're simply trying to recreate in this tiny chip the smallest functional unit that represents the biochemistry  the function and the mechanical strain that the cells experience in our bodies. So how does it work  Let me show you. We use techniques from the computer chip manufacturing industry to make these structures at a scale relevant to both the cells and their environment. We have three fluidic channels. In the center  we have a porous  flexible membrane on which we can add human cells from  say  our lungs  and then underneath  they had capillary cells  the cells in our blood vessels. And we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip that stretch and contract the membrane  so the cells experience the same mechanical forces that they did when we breathe. And they experience them how they did in the body. There's air flowing through the top channel  and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients through the blood channel. Now the chip is really beautiful  but what can we do with it  We can get incredible functionality inside these little chips. Let me show you. We could  for example  mimic infection  where we add bacterial cells into the lung. then we can add human white blood cells. White blood cells are our body's defense against bacterial invaders  and when they sense this inflammation due to infection  they will enter from the blood into the lung and engulf the bacteria. Well now you're going to see this happening live in an actual human lung on a chip. We've labeled the white blood cells so you can see them flowing through  and when they detect that infection  they begin to stick. They stick  and then they try to go into the lung side from blood channel. And you can see here  we can actually visualize a single white blood cell. It sticks  it wiggles its way through between the cell layers  through the pore  comes out on the other side of the membrane  and right there  it's going to engulf the bacteria labeled in green. In that tiny chip  you just witnessed one of the most fundamental responses our body has to an infection. It's the way we respond to    an immune response. It's pretty exciting. Now I want to share this picture with you  not just because it's so beautiful  but because it tells us an enormous amount of information about what the cells are doing within the chips. It tells us that these cells from the small airways in our lungs  actually have these hairlike structures that you would expect to see in the lung. These structures are called cilia  and they actually move the mucus out of the lung. Yeah. Mucus. Yuck. But mucus is actually very important. Mucus traps particulates  viruses  potential allergens  and these little cilia move and clear the mucus out. When they get damaged  say  by cigarette smoke for example  they don't work properly  and they can't clear that mucus out. And that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis. Cilia and the clearance of mucus are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis. But now  with the functionality that we get in these chips  we can begin to look for potential new treatments. We didn't stop with the lung on a chip. We have a gut on a chip. You can see one right here. And we've put intestinal human cells in a gut on a chip  and they're under constant peristaltic motion  this trickling flow through the cells  and we can mimic many of the functions that you actually would expect to see in the human intestine. Now we can begin to create models of diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome. This is a disease that affects a large number of individuals. It's really debilitating  and there aren't really many good treatments for it. Now we have a whole pipeline of different organ chips that we are currently working on in our labs. Now  the true power of this technology  however  really comes from the fact that we can fluidically link them. There's fluid flowing across these cells  so we can begin to interconnect multiple different chips together to form what we call a virtual human on a chip. Now we're really getting excited. We're not going to ever recreate  a whole human in these chips  but what our goal is is to be able to recreate sufficient functionality so that we can make better predictions of what's going to happen in humans. For example  now we can begin to explore what happens when we put a drug like an aerosol drug. Those of you like me who have asthma  when you take your inhaler  we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs  how it enters the body  how it might affect  say  your heart. Does it change the beating of your heart  Does it have a toxicity  Does it get cleared by the liver  Is it metabolized in the liver  Is it excreted in your kidneys  We can begin to study the dynamic response of the body to a drug. This could really revolutionize and be a game changer for not only the pharmaceutical industry  but a whole host of different industries  including the cosmetics industry. We can potentially use the skin on a chip that we're currently developing in the lab to test whether the ingredients in those products that you're using are actually  safe to put on your skin without the need for animal testing. We could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment  such as chemicals in regular household cleaners. We could also use the organs on chips for applications in bioterrorism or radiation exposure. We could use them to learn more about diseases such as ebola or other deadly diseases such as SARS. Organs on chips could also change the way we do clinical trials in the future. Right now  the average participant in a clinical trial is that  average. Tends to be middle aged  tends to be female. You won't find many clinical trials in which children are involved  yet every day  we give children medications  and the only safety data we have on that drug is one that we obtained from adults. Children are not adults. They may not respond in the same way adults do. There are other things like genetic differences in populations that may lead to at risk populations that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction. Now imagine if we could take cells from all those different populations  put them on chips  and create populations on a chip. This could really change the way we do clinical trials. And this is the team and the people that are doing this. We have engineers  we have cell biologists  we have clinicians  all working together. We're really seeing something quite incredible at the Wyss Institute. It's really a convergence of disciplines  where biology is influencing the way we design  the way we engineer  the way we build. It's pretty exciting. We're establishing important industry collaborations such as the one we have with a company that has expertise in large scale digital manufacturing. They're going to help us make  instead of one of these  millions of these chips  so that we can get them into the hands of as many researchers as possible. And this is key to the potential of that technology. Now let me show you our instrument. This is an instrument that our engineers are actually prototyping right now in the lab  and this instrument is going to give us the engineering controls that we're going to require in order to link    or more organ chips together. It does something else that's very important. It creates an easy user interface. So a cell biologist like me can come in  take a chip  put it in a cartridge like the prototype you see there  put the cartridge into the machine just like you would a C.D.  and away you go. Plug and play. Easy. Now  let's imagine a little bit what the future might look like if I could take your stem cells and put them on a chip  or your stem cells and put them on a chip. It would be a personalized chip just for you. Now all of us in here are individuals  and those individual differences mean that we could react very differently and sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs. I myself  a couple of years back  had a really bad headache  just couldn't shake it  thought    Well  I'll try something different.  I took some Advil. Fifteen minutes later  I was on my way to the emergency room with a full blown asthma attack. Now  obviously it wasn't fatal  but unfortunately  some of these adverse drug reactions can be fatal. So how do we prevent them  Well  we could imagine one day having Geraldine on a chip  having Danielle on a chip  having you on a chip. Personalized medicine. Thank you. So when I do my job  people hate me. In fact  the better I do my job  the more people hate me. And no  I'm not a meter maid  and I'm not an undertaker. I am a progressive lesbian talking head on Fox News.  Applause  So y'all heard that  right  Just to make sure  right  I am a gay talking head on Fox News. I am going to tell you how I do it and the most important thing I've learned. So I go on television. I debate people who literally want to obliterate everything I believe in  in some cases  who don't want me and people like me to even exist. It's sort of like Thanksgiving with your conservative uncle on steroids  with a live television audience of millions. It's totally almost just like that. And that's just on air. The hate mail I get is unbelievable. Last week alone  I got     pieces of nasty email and more hate tweets than I can even count. I was called an idiot  a traitor  a scourge  a cunt  and an ugly man  and that was just in one email. So what have I realized  being on the receiving end of all this ugliness  Well  my biggest takeaway is that for decades  we've been focused on political correctness  but what matters more is emotional correctness. Let me give you a small example. I don't care if you call me a dyke. I really don't. I care about two things. One  I care that you spell it right. Just quick refresher  it's D Y K E. You'd totally be surprised. And second  I don't care about the word  I care about how you use it. Are you being friendly  Are you just being naive  Or do you really want to hurt me personally  Emotional correctness is the tone  the feeling  how we say what we say  the respect and compassion we show one another. And what I've realized is that political persuasion doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data. Political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct. So when I first went to go work at Fox News  true confession  I expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle dragging. That  by the way  in case you're paying attention  is not emotionally correct. But liberals on my side  we can be self righteous  we can be condescending  we can be dismissive of anyone who doesn't agree with us. In other words  we can be politically right but emotionally wrong. And incidentally  that means that people don't like us. Right  Now here's the kicker. Conservatives are really nice. I mean  not all of them  and not the ones who send me hate mail  but you would be surprised. Sean Hannity is one of the sweetest guys I've ever met. He spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates  and I know that if I ever had a problem  he would do anything he could to help. Now  I think Sean Hannity is    percent politically wrong  but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive  and that's why people listen to him. Because you can't get anyone to agree with you if they don't even listen to you first. We spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements  and if we can start to find compassion for one another  then we have a shot at building common ground. It actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here  but when you try to put it in practice  it's really powerful. So someone who says they hate immigrants  I try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they've always known. Or someone who says they don't like teachers' unions  I bet they're really devastated to see their kid's school going into the gutter  and they're just looking for someone to blame. Our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us. That is emotional correctness. I'm not saying it's easy. An average of  like   .  times per day I have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities. This whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a political spiritual practice for me  and I ain't the Dalai Lama. I'm not perfect  but what I am is optimistic  because I don't just get hate mail. I get a lot of really nice letters  lots of them. And one of my all time favorites begins   I am not a big fan of your political leanings or your sometimes tortured logic  but I'm a big fan of you as a person.  Now this guy doesn't agree with me  yet. But he's listening  not because of what I said  but because of how I said it  and somehow  even though we've never met  we've managed to form a connection. That's emotional correctness  and that's how we start the conversations that really lead to change. Thank you. So this video was taken at Aquarius undersea laboratory four miles off the coast of Key Largo  about    feet below the surface. NASA uses this extreme environment to train astronauts and aquanauts  and last year  they invited us along for the ride. All the footage was taken from our open ROV  which is a robot that we built in our garage. So ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle  which in our case means our little robot sends live video across that ultra thin tether back to the computer topside. It's open source  meaning we publish and share all of our design files and all of our code online  allowing anyone to modify or improve or change the design. It's built with mostly off the shelf parts and costs about       times cheaper than the ROVs James Cameron used to explore the Titanic. So ROVs aren't new. They've been around for decades. Scientists use ROVs to explore the oceans. Oil and gas companies use them for exploration and construction. What we've built isn't unique. It's how we've built it that's really unique. So I want to give you a quick story of how it got started. So a few years ago  my friend Eric and I decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the Sierras. We had heard this story about lost gold from a Gold Rush era robbery  and we wanted to go up there. Unfortunately  we didn't have any money and we didn't have any tools to do it. So Eric had an initial design idea for a robot  but we didn't have all the parts figured out  so we did what anybody would do in our situation  we asked the Internet for help. More specifically  we created this website  openROV.com  and shared  our intentions and our plans For the first few months  it was just Eric and I talking back to each other on the forums  but pretty soon  we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists  and then actually professional ocean engineers who had some suggestions for what we should do. We kept working on it. We learned a lot. We kept prototyping  and eventually  we decided we wanted to go  to the cave. We were ready. So about that time  our little expedition became quite a story  and it got picked up in The New York Times. And we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted a kit that they could build this open ROV themselves. So we decided to put the project on Kickstarter  and when we did  we raised our funding goal in about two hours  and all of a sudden   had this money to make these kits. But then we had to learn how to make them. I mean  we had to learn small batch manufacturing. So we quickly learned that our garage was not big enough to hold our growing operation. But we were able to do it  we got all the kits made  thanks a lot to TechShop  which was a big help to us  and we shipped these kits all over the world just before Christmas of last year  so it was just a few months ago. But we're already starting to get video and photos back from all over the world  including this shot from under the ice in Antarctica. We've also learned the penguins love robots. So we're still publishing all the designs online  encouraging anyone to build these themselves. That's the only way that we could have done this. By being open source  we've created this distributed R D network  and we're moving faster than any venture backed counterpart. But the actual robot is really only half the story. The real potential  the long term potential  is with this community of DIY ocean explorers that are forming all over the globe. What can we discover when there's thousands of these devices roaming the seas  So you're probably all wondering  the cave. Did you find the gold  Well  we didn't find any gold  but we decided that what we found was much more valuable. It was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration. It's something that's not limited to the James Camerons of the world  but something that we're all participating in. It's an underwater world we're all exploring together. Thank you. Mobility in developing world cities is a very peculiar challenge  because different from health or education or housing  it tends to get worse as societies become richer. Clearly  a unsustainable model. Mobility  as most other developing country problems  more than a matter of money or technology  is a matter of equality  equity. The great inequality in developing countries makes it difficult to see  for example  that in terms of transport  an advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars  but rather one where even the rich use public transport. Or bicycles  For example  in Amsterdam  more than    percent of the population uses bicycles  despite the fact that the Netherlands has a higher income per capita than the United States. There is a conflict in developing world cities for money  for government investment. If more money is invested in highways  of course there is less money for housing  for schools  for hospitals  and also there is a conflict for space. There is a conflict for space between those with cars and those without them. Most of us accept today that private property and a market economy is the best way to manage most of society's resources. However  there is a problem with that  that market economy needs inequality of income in order to work. Some people must make more money  some others less. Some companies succeed. Others fail. Then what kind of equality can we hope for today with a market economy  I would propose two kinds which both have much to do with cities. The first one is equality of quality of life  especially for children  that all children should have  beyond the obvious health and education  access to green spaces  to sports facilities  to swimming pools  to music lessons. And the second kind of equality is one which we could call  democratic equality.  The first article in every constitution states that all citizens are equal before the law. That is not just poetry. It's a very powerful principle. For example  if that is true  a bus with    passengers has a right to    times more road space than a car with one. We have been so used to inequality  sometimes  that it's before our noses and we do not see it. Less than     years ago  women could not vote  and it seemed normal  in the same way that it seems normal today to see a bus in traffic. In fact  when I became mayor  applying that democratic principle that public good prevails over private interest  that a bus with     people has a right to     times more road space than a car  we implemented a mass transit system based on buses in exclusive lanes. We called it TransMilenio  in order to make buses sexier. And one thing is that it is also a very beautiful democratic symbol  because as buses zoom by  expensive cars stuck in traffic  it clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work. In fact  it's not just a matter of equity. It doesn't take Ph.D.'s. A committee of    year old children would find out in    minutes that the most efficient way to use scarce road space is with exclusive lanes for buses. In fact  buses are not sexy  but they are the only possible means to bring mass transit to all areas of fast growing developing cities. They also have great capacity. For example  this system in Guangzhou is moving more passengers our direction than all subway lines in China  except for one line in Beijing  at a fraction of the cost. We fought not just for space for buses  but we fought for space for people  and that was even more difficult. Cities are human habitats  and we humans are pedestrians. Just as fish need to swim or birds need to fly or deer need to run  we need to walk. There is a really enormous conflict  when we are talking about developing country cities  between pedestrians and cars. Here  what you see is a picture that shows insufficient democracy. What this shows is that people who walk are third class citizens while those who go in cars are first class citizens. In terms of transport infrastructure  what really makes a difference between advanced and backward cities is not highways or subways but quality sidewalks. Here they made a flyover  probably very useless  and they forgot to make a sidewalk. This is prevailing all over the world. Not even schoolchildren are more important than cars. In my city of Bogot   we fought a very difficult battle in order to take space from cars  which had been parking on sidewalks for decades  in order to make space for people that should reflect dignity of human beings  and to make space for protected bikeways. First of all  I had black hair before that. And I was almost impeached in the process. It is a very difficult battle. However  it was possible  finally  after very difficult battles  to make a city that would reflect some respect for human dignity  that would show that those who walk are equally important to those who have cars. Indeed  a very important ideological and political issue anywhere is how to distribute that most valuable resource of a city  which is road space. A city could find oil or diamonds underground and it would not be so valuable as road space. How to distribute it between pedestrians  bicycles  public transport and cars  This is not a technological issue  and we should remember that in no constitution parking is a constitutional right when we make that distribution. We also built  and this was    years ago  before there were bikeways in New York or in Paris or in London  it was a very difficult battle as well  more than     kilometers of protected bicycle ways. I don't think protected bicycle ways are a cute architectural feature. They are a right  just as sidewalks are  unless we believe that only those with access to a motor vehicle have a right to safe mobility  without the risk of getting killed. And just as busways are  protected bikeways also are a powerful symbol of democracy  because they show that a citizen on a     bicycle is equally important to one in a         car. And we are living in a unique moment in history. In the next    years  more than half of those cities which will exist in the year      will be built. In many developing country cities  more than    and    percent of the city which will exist in      will be built over the next four or five decades. But this is not just a matter for developing country cities. In the United States  for example  more than    million new homes must be built over the next    or    years. That's more than all the homes that today exist in Britain  France and Canada put together. And I believe that our cities today have severe flaws  and that different  better ones could be built. What is wrong with our cities today  Well  for example  if we tell any three year old child who is barely learning to speak in any city in the world today   Watch out  a car   the child will jump in fright  and with a very good reason  because there are more than        children who are killed by cars every year in the world. We have had cities for       years  and children could walk out of home and play. In fact  only very recently  towards       there were no cars. Cars have been here for really less than     years. They completely changed cities. In       for example  nobody was killed by cars in the United States. Only    years later  between      and       almost         people were killed by cars in the United States. Only in       almost       children were killed by cars in the United States. So we could make different cities  cities that will give more priority to human beings than to cars  that will give more public space to human beings than to cars  cities which show great respect for those most vulnerable citizens  such as children or the elderly. I will propose to you a couple of ingredients which I think would make cities much better  and it would be very simple to implement them in the new cities which are only being created. Hundreds of kilometers of greenways criss crossing cities in all directions. Children will walk out of homes into safe spaces. They could go for dozens of kilometers safely without any risk in wonderful greenways  sort of bicycle highways  and I would invite you to imagine the following  a city in which every other street would be a street only for pedestrians and bicycles. In new cities which are going to be built  this would not be particularly difficult. When I was mayor of Bogot   in only three years  we were able to create    kilometers  in one of the most dense cities in the world  of these bicycle highways. And this changes the way people live  move  enjoy the city. In this picture  you see in one of the very poor neighborhoods  we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street  and the cars still in the mud. Of course  I would love to pave this street for cars. But what do we do first  Ninety nine percent of the people in those neighborhoods don't have cars. But you see  when a city is only being created  it's very easy to incorporate this kind of infrastructure. Then the city grows around it. And of course this is just a glimpse of something which could be much better if we just create it  and it changes the way of life. And the second ingredient  which would solve mobility  that very difficult challenge in developing countries  in a very low cost and simple way  would be to have hundreds of kilometers of streets only for buses  buses and bicycles and pedestrians. This would be  again  a very low cost solution if implemented from the start  low cost  pleasant transit with natural sunlight. But unfortunately  reality is not as good as my dreams. Because of private property of land and high land prices  all developing country cities have a large problem of slums. In my country of Colombia  almost half the homes in cities initially were illegal developments. And of course it's very difficult to have mass transit or to use bicycles in such environments. But even legal developments have also been located in the wrong places  very far from the city centers where it's impossible to provide low cost  high frequency public transport. As a Latin American  and Latin America was the most recently organized region in the world  I would recommend  respectfully  passionately  to those countries which are yet to urbanize    Latin America went from    percent urban in      to    percent urban in         I would recommend Asian and African countries which are yet to urbanize  such as India which is only    percent urban now  that governments should acquire all land around cities. In this way  their cities could grow in the right places with the right spaces  with the parks  with the greenways  with the busways. The cities we are going to build over the next    years will determine quality of life and even happiness for billions of people towards the future. What a fantastic opportunity for leaders and many young leaders to come  especially in the developing countries. They can create a much happier life for billions towards the future. I am sure  I am optimistic  that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams. I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart  and so just before I get going  I wanted to tell you as a South African that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago. Nelson Mandela has come to the end of his long walk to freedom. And so this talk is going to be for him. I grew up in wonder. I grew up amongst those animals. I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve. It's a place where my family has been in the safari business for four generations. Now for as long as I can remember  my job has been to take people out into nature  and so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering. Africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories  and so what I have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories  stories about heroes of heart. Now my stories are not the stories that you'll hear on the news  and while it's true that Africa is a harsh place  I also know it to be a place where people  animals and ecosystems teach us about a more interconnected world. When I was nine years old  President Mandela came to stay with my family. He had just been released from his    years of incarceration  and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status. Members of the African National Congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye  and it's true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi. But it was a defining time for me as a young boy. I would take him breakfast in bed  and then  in an old track suit and slippers  he would go for a walk around the garden. At night  I would sit with my family around the snowy  bunny eared TV  and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly. He was bringing peace to a divided and violent South Africa  one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity. Mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think  to create in himself the things he most wanted for South Africa  peace  reconciliation  harmony. Through this act of immense open heartedness  he was to become the embodiment of what in South Africa we call  ubuntu.  Ubuntu  I am because of you. Or  people are not people without other people. It's not a new idea or value but it's one that I certainly think at these times is worth building on. In fact  it is said that in the collective consciousness of Africa  we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others. Ubuntu is at play right now. You are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who I am. Without you  I'm just a guy talking to an empty room  and I spent a lot of time last week doing that  and it's not the same as this. If Mandela was the national and international embodiment  then the man who taught me the most about this value personally was this man  Solly Mhlongo. Solly was born under a tree    kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique. He would never have a lot of money  but he was to be one of the richest men I would ever meet. Solly grew up tending to his father's cattle. Now  I can tell you  I don't know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle  but it makes for  ber resourcefulness. The first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks. Where he had learned to do that out in the bush I have no idea  but he could do it. He then moved across into what we called the habitat team. These were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well being. He fixed roads  he mended wetlands  he did some anti poaching. And then one day we were out together  and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked. And it was an old track  but for fun he turned and he began to follow it  and I tell you  I could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a Ph.D. level tracker. If you drove past Solly somewhere out on the reserve  you look up in your rearview mirror  you'd see he'd stopped the car        meters down the road just in case you need help with something. The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said   Solly  you are pathologically helpful.  When I started professionally guiding people out into this environment  Solly was my tracker. We worked together as a team. And the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your East Coast  and they said to Solly  on the side  they said   Before we even go out to see lions and leopards  we want to see where you live.  So we took them up to his house  and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when Solly's wife  who was learning English  was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying   Hello  I love you. Welcome  I love you.   Laughter  And there was something so beautifully African about it to me  this small house with a huge heart in it. Now on the day that Solly saved my life  he was already my hero. It was a hot day  and we found ourselves down by the river. Because of the heat  I took my shoes off  and I rolled up my pants  and I walked into the water. Solly remained on the bank. The water was clear running over sand  and we turned and we began to make our way upstream. And a few meters ahead of us  there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank  and its branches were touching the water  and it was shadowy. And if had been a horror movie  people in the audience would have started saying   Don't go in there. Don't go in there.   Laughter  And of course  the crocodile was in the shadows. Now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite. Wham  It hits me by my right leg. It pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up. I'm able to grab a branch. It's shaking me violently. It's a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you  and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that. Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble. He turns. He begins to make his way to me. The croc again continues to shake me. It goes to bite me a second time. I notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream. As it bites the second time  I kick. My foot goes down its throat. It spits me out. I pull myself up into the branches  and as I come out of the water  I look over my shoulder. My leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description. The bone is cracked. The meat is torn up. I make an instant decision that I'll never look at that again. As I come out of the water  Solly arrives at a deep section  a channel between us. He knows  he sees the state of my leg  he knows that between him and I there is a crocodile  and I can tell you this man doesn't slow down for one second. He comes straight into the channel. He wades in to above his waist. He gets to me. He grabs me. I'm still in a vulnerable position. He picks me and puts me on his shoulder. This is the other thing about Solly  he's freakishly strong. He turns. He walks me up the bank. He lays me down. He pulls his shirt off. He wraps it around my leg  picks me up a second time  walks me to a vehicle  and he's able to get me to medical attention. And I survive. Now    Applause  Now I don't know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you  but for Solly  it was as natural as breathing. And he is one amazing example of what I have experienced all over Africa. In a more collective society  we realize from the inside that our own well being is deeply tied to the well being of others. Danger is shared. Pain is shared. Joy is shared. Achievement is shared. Houses are shared. Food is shared. Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share  and what Solly taught me that day is the essence of this value  his animated  empathetic action in every moment. Now although the root word is about people  I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people. And then I met this young lady. Her name was Elvis. In fact  Solly gave her the name Elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the Elvis the pelvis dance. She was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis. She arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route. When I first saw her  I thought she would be dead in a matter of days. And yet  for the next five years she returned in the winter months. And we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track. It looked like an inverted bracket  and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow  and then we would come around the corner  and there she would be with her herd. And that outpouring of emotion from people on our safari trucks as they saw her  it was this sense of kinship. And it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals. And yet still I remained amazed that she was surviving. And then one day we came across them at this small water hole. It was sort of a hollow in the ground. And I watched as the matriarch drank  and then she turned in that  beautiful slow motion of elephants  looks like the arm in motion  and she began to make her way up the steep bank. The rest of the herd turned and began to follow. And I watched young Elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill. She got visibly    ears came forward  she had a full go of it and halfway up  her legs gave way  and she fell backwards. She attempted it a second time  and again  halfway up  she fell backwards. And on the third attempt  an amazing thing happened. Halfway up the bank  a young teenage elephant came in behind her  and he propped his trunk underneath her  and he began to shovel her up the bank. And it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant. The next day I watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth  and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground. And a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant. What Elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu  and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild  we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us. And it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet. If Africa has a gift to share  it's a gift of a more collective society. And while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea  what I see is the essence of that value being invented here. Thank you. Pat Mitchell  So Boyd  we know that you knew President Mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today  and deeply distraught and know the tragic loss that it is to the world. But I just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts  because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session. Boyd Varty  Well thanks  Pat. I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on. He was suffering. And so of course there's the mixed emotions. But I just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the Oprah show and asked her what the show would be about. And she was like   Well  it'll be about you.  I mean  that's just incredible humility. He was the father of our nation and we've got a road to walk in South Africa. And everything  they used to call it Madiba magic. You know  he used to go to a rugby match and we would win. Anywhere he went  things went well. But I think that magic will be with us  and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for. And so that's what I'm going to try and do  and that's what people all over  South Africa are trying to do. PM  And that's what you've done today. BV  Oh  thank you. PM  Thank you. BV  Thank you. Thanks very much. I would like to show you how architecture has helped to change the life of my community and has opened opportunities to hope. I am a native of Burkina Faso. According to the World Bank  Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world  but what does it look like to grow up in a place like that  I am an example of that. I was born in a little village called Gando. In Gando  there was no electricity  no access to clean drinking water  and no school. But my father wanted me to learn how to read and write. For this reason  I had to leave my family when I was seven and to stay in a city far away from my village with no contact with my family. In this place I sat in a class like that with more than     other kids  and for six years. In this time  it just happened to me to come to school to realize that my classmate died. Today  not so much has changed. There is still no electricity in my village. People still are dying in Burkina Faso  and access to clean drinking water is still a big problem. I had luck. I was lucky  because this is a fact of life when you grow up in a place like that. But I was lucky. I had a scholarship. I could go to Germany to study. So now  I suppose  I don't need to explain to you how great a privilege it is for me to be standing before you today. From Gando  my home village in Burkina Faso  to Berlin in Germany to become an architect is a big  big step. But what to do with this privilege  Since I was a student  I wanted to open up better opportunities to other kids in Gando. I just wanted to use my skills and build a school. But how do you do it when you're still a student and you don't have money  Oh yes  I started to make drawings and asked for money. Fundraising was not an easy task. I even asked my classmates to spend less money on coffee and cigarettes  but to sponsor my school project. In real wonder  two years later  I was able to collect        U.S. dollars. When I came home to Gando to bring the good news  my people were over the moon  but when they realized that I was planning to use clay  they were shocked.  A clay building is not able to stand a rainy season  and Francis wants us to use it and build a school. Is this the reason why he spent so much time in Europe studying instead of working in the field with us   My people build all the time with clay  but they don't see any innovation with mud. So I had to convince everybody. I started to speak with the community  and I could convince everybody  and we could start to work. And the women  the men  everybody from the village  was part of this building process. I was allowed to use even traditional techniques. So clay floor for example  the young men come and stand like that  beating  hours for hours  and then their mothers came  and they are beating in this position  for hours  giving water and beating. And then the polishers come. They start polishing it with a stone for hours. And then you have this result  very fine  like a baby bottom. It's not photoshopped.  Laughter  This is the school  built with the community. The walls are totally made out of compressed clay blocks from Gando. The roof structure is made with cheap steel bars normally hiding inside concrete. And the classroom  the ceiling is made out of both of them used together. In this school  there was a simple idea  to create comfort in a classroom. Don't forget  it can be    degrees in Burkina Faso  so with simple ventilation  I wanted to make the classroom good for teaching and learning. And this is the project today     years old  still in best condition. And the kids  they love it. And for me and my community  this project was a huge success. It has opened up opportunities to do more projects in Gando. So I could do a lot of projects  and here I am going to share with you only three of them. The first one is the school extension  of course. How do you explain drawings and engineering to people who are neither able to read nor write  I started to build a prototype like that. The innovation was to build a clay vault. So then  I jumped on the top like that  with my team  and it works. The community is looking. It still works. So we can build.  Laughter  And we kept building  and that is the result. The kids are happy  and they love it. The community is very proud. We made it. And even animals  like these donkeys  love our buildings. The next project is the library in Gando. And see now  we tried to introduce different ideas in our buildings  but we often don't have so much material. Something we have in Gando are clay pots. We wanted to use them to create openings. So we just bring them like you can see to the building site. we start cutting them  and then we place them on top of the roof before we pour the concrete  and you have this result. The openings are letting the hot air out and light in. Very simple. My most recent project in Gando is a high school project. I would like to share with you this. The innovation in this project is to cast mud like you cast concrete. How do you cast mud  We start making a lot of mortars  like you can see  and when everything is ready  when you know what is the best recipe and the best form  you start working with the community. And sometimes I can leave. They will do it themselves. I came to speak to you like that. Another factor in Gando is rain. When the rains come  we hurry up to protect our fragile walls against the rain. Don't confound with Christo and Jeanne Claude. It is simply how we protect our walls. The rain in Burkina comes very fast  and after that  you have floods everywhere in the country. But for us  the rain is good. It brings sand and gravel to the river we need to use to build. We just wait for the rain to go. We take the sand  we mix it with clay  and we keep building. That is it. The Gando project was always connected to training the people  because I just wanted  one day when I fall down and die  that at least one person from Gando keeps doing this work. But you will be surprised. I'm still alive. And my people now can use their skills to earn money themselves. Usually  for a young man from Gando to earn money  you have to leave the country to the city  sometimes leave the country and some never come back  making the community weaker. But now they can stay in the country and work on different building sites and earn money to feed their family. There's a new quality in this work. Yes  you know it. I have won a lot of awards through this work. For sure  it has opened opportunities. I have become myself known. But the reason why I do what I do is my community. When I was a kid  I was going to school  I was coming back every holiday to Gando. By the end of every holidays  I had to say goodbye to the community  going from one compound to another one. All women in Gando will open their clothes like that and give me the last penny. In my culture  this is a symbol of deep affection. As a seven year old guy  I was impressed. I just asked my mother one day   Why do all these women love me so much   She just answered   They are contributing to pay for your education hoping that you will be successful and one day come back and help improve the quality of life of the community.  I hope now that I was able to make my community proud through this work  and I hope I was able to prove you the power of community  and to show you that architecture can be inspiring for communities to shape their own future. Merci beaucoup.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  So how many of you have ever been in a cave before  Okay  a few of you. When you think of a cave  most of you think of a tunnel going through solid rock  and in fact  that's how most caves are. Around this half of the country  most of your caves are made of limestone. Back where I'm from  most of our  caves are made of lava rock  because we have a lot of volcanoes out there. But the caves I want to share  with you today are made completely of ice  specifically glacier ice that's formed in the side of the tallest mountain in the state of Oregon  called Mount Hood. Now Mount Hood's only  one hour's drive from Portland  the largest city in Oregon  where over two million people live. Now the most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to find a new cave and be the first human to ever go into it. The second most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave. Now these days  with so many people hiking around  it's pretty hard to find a new cave  so you can imagine how excited we were to find three new caves within sight of Oregon's largest city and realize that they had never been explored or mapped before. It was kind of like being an astronaut  because we were getting to see things and go places that no one had ever seen or gone to before. So what is a glacier  Well  those of you who have ever seen or touched snow  you know that it's really light  because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together  and it's mostly air. If you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball  it gets really small  hard and dense. Well  on a mountain like Hood  where it snows over    feet a year  it crushes the air out of it and gradually forms it into hard blue ice. Now each year  more and more ice stacks up on top of it  and eventually it gets so heavy that it starts to slide down the mountain under its own weight  forming a slow moving river of ice. When ice packed like that starts to move  we call it a glacier  and we give it a name. The name of the glacier these caves are formed in is the Sandy Glacier. Now each year  as new snow lands on the glacier  it melts in the summer sun  and it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice  and they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier  forming big networks of caves  sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock. Now the crazy thing about glacier caves is that each year  new tunnels form. Different waterfalls pop up or move around from place to place inside the cave. Warm water from the top of the ice is boring its way down  and warm air from below the mountain actually rises up  gets into the cave  and melts the ceilings back taller and taller. But the weirdest thing about glacier caves is that the entire cave is moving  because it's formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that's slowly sliding down the mountain. Now this is Brent McGregor  my cave exploration partner. He and I have both been exploring caves a long time and we've been climbing mountains a long time  but neither one of us had ever really explored a glacier cave before. Back in       Brent saw a YouTube video of a couple of hikers that stumbled across the entrance to one of these caves. There were no GPS coordinates for it  and all we knew was that it was somewhere out on the Sandy Glacier. So in July of that year  we went out on the glacier  and we found a big crack in the ice. We had to build snow and ice anchors so that we could tie off ropes and rappel down into the hole. This is me looking into the entrance crevasse. At the end of this hole  we found a huge tunnel going right up the mountain underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice. We followed this cave back for about a half mile until it came to an end  and then with the help of our survey tools we made a three dimensional map of the cave on our way back out. So how do you map a cave  Well  cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps because they have pits and holes  going to overlapping levels. To make a cave map  you have to set up survey stations every few feet inside the cave  and you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations. Then you use a compass and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings. Now those of you taking trigonometry  that particular type of math is very useful for making maps like this because it allows you to measure heights and distances without actually having to go there. In fact  the more I mapped and studied caves  the more useful I found all that math that I originally hated in school to be. So when you're done surveying  you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well  and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this  and it'll show you both a bird's eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage  kind of like an ant farm view. We named this cave Snow Dragon Cave because it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow. Now later this summer  as more snow melted off the glacier  we found more caves  and we realized they were all connected. Not long after we mapped Snow Dragon  Brent discovered this new cave not very far away. The inside of it was coated with ice  so we had to wear big spikes on our feet called crampons so we could walk around without slipping. This cave was amazing. The ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green because the sunlight from far above was shining through the ice and lighting it all up. And we couldn't understand why this cave was so much colder than Snow Dragon until we got to the end and we found out why. There was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin going     feet straight up to the surface of the glacier. Cold air from the top of the mountain was flowing down this hole and blasting through the cave  freezing everything inside of it. And we were so excited about finding this new pit  we actually came back in January the following year so we could be the first ones to explore it. It was so cold outside  we actually had to sleep inside the cave. There's our camp on the left side  of this entrance room. The next morning  we climbed out of the cave and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier  where we finally rigged and rappelled this pit for the very first time. Brent named this cave Pure Imagination  I think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined. So besides really cool ice  what else is inside these caves  Well not too much lives in them  because they're so cold and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year. But there are some really cool things in there. There's weird bacteria living in the water that actually eat and digest rocks to make their own food to live under this ice. In fact  this past summer  scientists collected samples of water and ice specifically to see if things called extremophiles  tiny lifeforms that are evolved to live in completely hostile conditions  might be living under the ice  kind of like what they hope to find on the polar icecaps of Mars someday. Another really cool things is that  as seeds and birds land on the surface of the glacier and die  they get buried in the snow and gradually become part of the glacier  sinking deeper and deeper into the ice. As these caves form and melt  their way up into the ice  they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling and fall onto the cave floor  where we end up finding them. For example  this is a noble fir seed we found. It's been frozen in the ice for over     years  and it's just now starting to sprout. This mallard duck feather was found over       feet in the back of Snow Dragon Cave. This duck died on the surface of the glacier long  long ago  and its feathers have finally made it down through over     feet of ice before falling inside the cave. And this beautiful quartz crystal was also found in the back of Snow Dragon. Even now  Brent and I find it hard to believe that all these discoveries were  essentially in our own backyard  hidden away  just waiting to be found. Like I said earlier  the idea of discovering in this busy world we live in kind of seems like something  you can only do with space travel now  but that's not true. Every year  new caves get discovered that no one has ever been in before. So it's actually not too late for one of you to become a discoverer yourself. You just have to be willing to look and go where people don't often go and focus your eyes and your mind to recognize the discovery when you see it  because it might be in your own backyard. Thank you very much. I have a question  Who here remembers when they first realized they were going to die  I do. I was a young boy  and my grandfather had just died  and I remember a few days later lying in bed at night trying to make sense of what had happened. What did it mean that he was dead  Where had he gone  It was like a hole in reality had opened up and swallowed him. But then the really shocking question occurred to me  If he could die  could it happen to me too  Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me  Would it open up beneath my bed and swallow me as I slept  Well  at some point  all children become aware of death. It can happen in different ways  of course  and usually comes in stages. Our idea of death develops as we grow older. And if you reach back into the dark corners of your memory  you might remember something like what I felt when my grandfather died and when I realized it could happen to me too  that sense that behind all of this the void is waiting. And this development in childhood reflects the development of our species. Just as there was a point in your development as a child when your sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for you to realize you were mortal  so at some point in the evolution of our species  some early human's sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for them to become the first human to realize   I'm going to die.  This is  if you like  our curse. It's the price we pay for being so damn clever. We have to live in the knowledge that the worst thing that can possibly happen one day surely will  the end of all our projects  our hopes  our dreams  of our individual world. We each live in the shadow of a personal apocalypse. And that's frightening. It's terrifying. And so we look for a way out. And in my case  as I was about five years old  this meant asking my mum. Now when I first started asking what happens when we die  the grown ups around me at the time answered with a typical English mix of awkwardness and half hearted Christianity  and the phrase I heard most often was that granddad was now  up there looking down on us   and if I should die too  which wouldn't happen of course  then I too would go up there  which made death sound a lot like an existential elevator. Now this didn't sound very plausible. I used to watch a children's news program at the time  and this was the era of space exploration. There were always rockets going up into the sky  up into space  going up there. But none of the astronauts when they came back ever mentioned having met my granddad or any other dead people. But I was scared  and the idea of taking the existential elevator to see my granddad sounded a lot better than being swallowed by the void while I slept. And so I believed it anyway  even though it didn't make much sense. And this thought process that I went through as a child  and have been through many times since  including as a grown up  is a product of what psychologists call a bias. Now a bias is a way in which we systematically get things wrong  ways in which we miscalculate  misjudge  distort reality  or see what we want to see  and the bias I'm talking about works like this  Confront someone with the fact that they are going to die and they will believe just about any story that tells them it isn't true and they can  instead  live forever  even if it means taking the existential elevator. Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all. It has been demonstrated in over     empirical studies. Now these studies are ingenious  but they're simple. They work like this. You take two groups of people who are similar in all relevant respects  and you remind one group that they're going to die but not the other  then you compare their behavior. So you're observing how it biases behavior when people become aware of their mortality. And every time  you get the same result  People who are made aware of their mortality are more willing to believe stories that tell them they can escape death and live forever. So here's an example  One recent study took two groups of agnostics  that is people who are undecided in their religious beliefs. Now  one group was asked to think about being dead. The other group was asked to think about being lonely. They were then asked again about their religious beliefs. Those who had been asked to think about being dead were afterwards twice as likely to express faith in God and Jesus. Twice as likely. Even though the before they were all equally agnostic. But put the fear of death in them  and they run to Jesus. Now  this shows that reminding people of death biases them to believe  regardless of the evidence  and it works not just for religion  but for any kind of belief system that promises immortality in some form  whether it's becoming famous or having children or even nationalism  which promises you can live on as part of a greater whole. This is a bias that has shaped the course of human history. Now  the theory behind this bias in the over     studies is called terror management theory  and the idea is simple. It's just this. We develop our worldviews  that is  the stories we tell ourselves about the world and our place in it  in order to help us manage the terror of death. And these immortality stories have thousands of different manifestations  but I believe that behind the apparent diversity there are actually just four basic forms that these immortality stories can take. And we can see them repeating themselves throughout history  just with slight variations to reflect the vocabulary of the day. Now I'm going to briefly introduce these four basic forms of immortality story  and I want to try to give you some sense of the way in which they're retold by each culture or generation using the vocabulary of their day. Now  the first story is the simplest. We want to avoid death  and the dream of doing that in this body in this world forever is the first and simplest kind of immortality story  and it might at first sound implausible  but actually  almost every culture in human history has had some myth or legend of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth or something that promises to keep us going forever. Ancient Egypt had such myths  ancient Babylon  ancient India. Throughout European history  we find them in the work of the alchemists  and of course we still believe this today  only we tell this story using the vocabulary of science. So     years ago  hormones had just been discovered  and people hoped that hormone treatments were going to cure aging and disease  and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells  genetic engineering  and nanotechnology. But the idea that science can cure death is just one more chapter in the story of the magical elixir  a story that is as old as civilization. But betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir and staying alive forever is a risky strategy. When we look back through history at all those who have sought an elixir in the past  the one thing they now have in common is that they're all dead. So we need a backup plan  and exactly this kind of plan B is what the second kind of immortality story offers  and that's resurrection. And it stays with the idea that I am this body  I am this physical organism. It accepts that I'm going to have to die but says  despite that  I can rise up and I can live again. In other words  I can do what Jesus did. Jesus died  he was three days in the  tomb   and then he rose up and lived again. And the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again is orthodox believe  not just for Christians but also Jews and Muslims. But our desire to believe this story is so deeply embedded that we are reinventing it again for the scientific age  for example  with the idea of cryonics. That's the idea that when you die  you can have yourself frozen  and then  at some point when technology has advanced enough  you can be thawed out and repaired and revived and so resurrected. And so some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again  and other people believe an  omnipotent scientist will do it. But for others  the whole idea of resurrection  of climbing out of the grave  it's just too much like a bad zombie movie. They find the body too messy  too unreliable to guarantee eternal life  and so they set their hopes on the third  more spiritual immortality story  the idea that we can leave our body behind and live on as a soul. Now  the majority of people on Earth believe they have a soul  and the idea is central to many religions. But even though  in its current form  in its traditional form  the idea of the soul is still hugely popular  nonetheless we are again reinventing it for the digital age  for example with the idea that you can leave your body behind by uploading your mind  your essence  the real you  onto a computer  and so live on as an avatar in the ether. But of course there are skeptics who say if we look at the evidence of science  particularly neuroscience  it suggests that your mind  your essence  the real you  is very much dependent on a particular part of your body  that is  your brain. And such skeptics can find comfort in the fourth kind of immortality story  and that is legacy  the idea that you can live on through the echo you leave in the world  like the great Greek warrior Achilles  who sacrificed his life fighting at Troy so that he might win immortal fame. And the pursuit of fame is as widespread and popular now as it ever was  and in our digital age  it's even easier to achieve. You don't need to be a great warrior like Achilles or a great king or hero. All you need is an Internet connection and a funny cat.  Laughter  But some people prefer to leave a more tangible  biological legacy    children  for example. Or they like  they hope  to live on as part of some greater whole  a nation or a family or a tribe  their gene pool. But again  there are skeptics who doubt whether legacy really is immortality. Woody Allen  for example  who said   I don't want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen. I want to live on in my apartment.  So those are the four basic kinds of immortality stories  and I've tried to give just some sense of how they're retold by each generation with just slight variations to fit the fashions of the day. And the fact that they recur in this way  in such a similar form but in such different belief systems  suggests  I think  that we should be skeptical of the truth of any particular version of these stories. The fact that some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again and others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it suggests that neither are really believing this on the strength of the evidence. Rather  we believe these stories because we are biased to believe them  and we are biased to believe them because we are so afraid of death. So the question is  are we doomed to lead the one life we have in a way that is shaped by fear and denial  or can we overcome this bias  Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus thought we could. He argued that the fear of death is natural  but it is not rational.  Death   he said   is nothing to us  because when we are here  death is not  and when death is here  we are gone.  Now this is often quoted  but it's difficult to really grasp  to really internalize  because exactly this idea of being gone is so difficult to imagine. So       years later  another philosopher  Ludwig Wittgenstein  put it like this   Death is not an event in life  We do not live to experience death. And so   he added   in this sense  life has no end.  So it was natural for me as a child to fear being swallowed by the void  but it wasn't rational  because being swallowed by the void is not something that any of us will ever live to experience. Now  overcoming this bias is not easy because the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us  yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational  and when we bring out into the open the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us  then we can at least start to try to minimize the influence it has on our lives. Now  I find it helps to see life as being like a book  Just as a book is bounded by its covers  by beginning and end  so our lives are bounded by birth and death  and even though a book is limited by beginning and end  it can encompass distant landscapes  exotic figures  fantastic adventures. And even though a book is limited by beginning and end  the characters within it know no horizons. They only know the moments that make up their story  even when the book is closed. And so the characters of a book are not afraid of reaching the last page. Long John Silver is not afraid of you finishing your copy of  Treasure Island.  And so it should be with us. Imagine the book of your life  its covers  its beginning and end  and your birth and your death. You can only know the moments in between  the moments that make up your life. It makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers  whether before your birth or after your death. And you needn't worry how long the book is  or whether it's a comic strip or an epic. The only thing that matters is that you make it a good story. Thank you. A couple of years ago  Harvard Business School chose the best business model of that year. It chose Somali piracy. Pretty much around the same time  I discovered that there were     seafarers being held hostage on ships  often anchored just off the Somali coast in plain sight. And I learned these two facts  and I thought  what's going on in shipping  And I thought  would that happen in any other industry  Would we see     airline pilots held captive in their jumbo jets on a runway for months  or a year  Would we see     Greyhound bus drivers  It wouldn't happen. So I started to get intrigued. And I discovered another fact  which to me was more astonishing almost for the fact that I hadn't known it before at the age of       . That is how fundamentally  we still depend on shipping. Because perhaps the general public thinks of shipping as an old fashioned industry  something brought by sailboat with Moby Dicks and Jack Sparrows. But shipping isn't that. Shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been. Shipping brings us    percent of world trade. Shipping has quadrupled in size since     . We are more dependent on it now than ever. And yet  for such an enormous industry    there are a         working vessels on the sea   it's become pretty much invisible. Now that sounds absurd in Singapore to say that  because here shipping is so present that you stuck a ship on top of a hotel. But elsewhere in the world  if you ask the general public what they know about shipping and how much trade is carried by sea  you will get essentially a blank face. You will ask someone on the street if they've heard of Microsoft. I should think they'll say yes  because they'll know that they make software that goes on computers  and occasionally works. But if you ask them if they've heard of Maersk  I doubt you'd get the same response  even though Maersk  which is just one shipping company amongst many  has revenues pretty much on a par with Microsoft.     .  billion  Now why is this  A few years ago  the first sea lord of the British admiralty    he is called the first sea lord  although the chief of the army is not called a land lord   he said that we  and he meant in the industrialized nations in the West  that we suffer from sea blindness. We are blind to the sea as a place of industry or of work. It's just something we fly over  a patch of blue on an airline map. Nothing to see  move along. So I wanted to open my own eyes to my own sea blindness  so I ran away to sea. A couple of years ago  I took a passage on the Maersk Kendal  a mid sized container ship carrying nearly       boxes  and I departed from Felixstowe  on the south coast of England  and I ended up right here in Singapore five weeks later  considerably less jet lagged than I am right now. And it was a revelation. We traveled through five seas  two oceans  nine ports  and I learned a lot about shipping. And one of the first things that surprised me when I got on board Kendal was  where are all the people  I have friends in the Navy who tell me they sail with       sailors at a time  but on Kendal there were only    crew. Now that's because shipping is very efficient. Containerization has made it very efficient. Ships have automation now. They can operate with small crews. But it also means that  in the words of a port chaplain I once met  the average seafarer you're going to find on a container ship is either tired or exhausted  because the pace of modern shipping is quite punishing for what the shipping calls its human element  a strange phrase which they don't seem to realize sounds a little bit inhuman. So most seafarers now working on container ships often have less than two hours in port at a time. They don't have time to relax. They're at sea for months at a time  and even when they're on board  they don't have access to what a five year old would take for granted  the Internet. And another thing that surprised me when I got on board Kendal was who I was sitting next to    Not the queen  I can't imagine why they put me underneath her portrait    But around that dining table in the officer's saloon  I was sitting next to a Burmese guy  I was opposite a Romanian  a Moldavian  an Indian. On the next table was a Chinese guy  and in the crew room  it was entirely Filipinos. So that was a normal working ship. Now how is that possible  Because the biggest dramatic change in shipping over the last    years  when most of the general public stopped noticing it  was something called an open registry  or a flag of convenience. Ships can now fly the flag of any nation that provides a flag registry. You can get a flag from the landlocked nation of Bolivia  or Mongolia  or North Korea  though that's not very popular. So we have these very multinational  global  mobile crews on ships. And that was a surprise to me. And when we got to pirate waters  down the Bab el Mandeb strait and into the Indian Ocean  the ship changed. And that was also shocking  because suddenly  I realized  as the captain said to me  that I had been crazy to choose to go through pirate waters on a container ship. We were no longer allowed on deck. There were double pirate watches. And at that time  there were those      seafarers being held hostage  and some of them were held hostage for years because of the nature of shipping and the flag of convenience. Not all of them  but some of them were  because for the minority of unscrupulous ship owners  it can be easy to hide behind the anonymity offered by some flags of convenience. What else does our sea blindness mask  Well  if you go out to sea on a ship or on a cruise ship  and look up to the funnel  you'll see very black smoke. And that's because shipping has very tight margins  and they want cheap fuel  so they use something called bunker fuel  which was described to me by someone in the tanker industry as the dregs of the refinery  or just one step up from asphalt. And shipping is the greenest method of transport. In terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile  it emits about a thousandth of aviation and about a tenth of trucking. But it's not benign  because there's so much of it. So shipping emissions are about three to four percent  almost the same as aviation's. And if you put shipping emissions on a list of the countries' carbon emissions  it would come in about sixth  somewhere near Germany. It was calculated in      that the    largest ships pollute in terms of particles and soot and noxious gases as much as all the cars in the world. And the good news is that people are now talking about sustainable shipping. There are interesting initiatives going on. But why has it taken so long  When are we going to start talking and thinking about shipping miles as well as air miles  I also traveled to Cape Cod to look at the plight of the North Atlantic right whale  because this to me was one of the most surprising things about my time at sea  and what it made me think about. We know about man's impact on the ocean in terms of fishing and overfishing  but we don't really know much about what's happening underneath the water. And in fact  shipping has a role to play here  because shipping noise has contributed to damaging the acoustic habitats of ocean creatures. Light doesn't penetrate beneath the surface of the water  so ocean creatures like whales and dolphins and even     species of fish communicate by sound. And a North Atlantic right whale can transmit across hundreds of miles. A humpback can transmit a sound across a whole ocean. But a supertanker can also be heard coming across a whole ocean  and because the noise that propellers make underwater is sometimes at the same frequency that whales use  then it can damage their acoustic habitat  and they need this for breeding  for finding feeding grounds  for finding mates. And the acoustic habitat of the North Atlantic right whale has been reduced by up to    percent. But there are no laws governing  acoustic pollution yet. And when I arrived in Singapore  and I apologize for this  but I  didn't want to get off my ship. I'd really loved being on board Kendal. I'd been well treated by the crew  I'd had a garrulous and entertaining captain  and I would happily have signed up for another five weeks  something that the captain also said I was crazy to think about. But I wasn't there for nine months at a time like the Filipino seafarers  who  when I asked them to describe their job to me  called it  dollar for homesickness.  They had good salaries  but theirs is still an isolating and difficult life in a dangerous and often difficult element. But when I get to this part  I'm in two minds  because I want to salute those seafarers who bring us    percent of everything and get very little thanks or recognition for it. I want to salute the         ships that are at sea that are doing that work  coming in and out every day  bringing us what we need. But I also want to see shipping  and us  the general public  who know so little about it  to have a bit more scrutiny  to be a bit more transparent  to have    percent transparency. Because I think we could all benefit from doing something very simple  which is learning to see the sea. Thank you. By       Detroit had become the poster child for an American city in crisis. There was a housing collapse  an auto industry collapse  and the population had plummeted by    percent between      and       and many people were beginning to write it off  as it had topped the list of American shrinking cities. By       I had also been asked by the Kresge Foundation and the city of Detroit to join them in leading a citywide planning process for the city to create a shared vision for its future. I come to this work as an architect and an urban planner  and I've spent my career working in other contested cities  like Chicago  my hometown  Harlem  which is my current home  Washington  D.C.  and Newark  New Jersey. All of these cities  to me  still had a number of unresolved issues related to urban justice  issues of equity  inclusion and access. Now by       as well  popular design magazines were also beginning to take a closer look at cities like Detroit  and devoting whole issues to  fixing the city.  I was asked by a good friend  Fred Bernstein  to do an interview for the October issue of Architect magazine  and he and I kind of had a good chuckle when we saw the magazine released with the title   Can This Planner Save Detroit   So I'm smiling with a little bit of embarrassment right now  because obviously  it's completely absurd that a single person  let alone a planner  could save a city. But I'm also smiling because I thought it represented a sense of hopefulness that our profession could play a role in helping the city to think about how it would recover from its severe crisis. So I'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon and tell you a little bit about our process for fixing the city  a little bit about Detroit  and I want to do that through the voices of Detroiters. So we began our process in September of     . It's just after a special mayoral election  and word has gotten out that there is going to be this citywide planning process  which brings a lot of anxiety and fears among Detroiters. We had planned to hold a number of community meetings in rooms like this to introduce the planning process  and people came out from all over the city  including areas that were stable neighborhoods  as well as areas that were beginning to see a lot of vacancy. And most of our audience was representative of the    percent African American population in the city at that time. So obviously  we have a Q A portion of our program  and people line up to mics to ask questions. Many of them step very firmly to the mic  put their hands across their chest  and go   I know you people are trying to move me out of my house  right   So that question is really powerful  and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment  when you connect it to the stories that some Detroiters had  and actually a lot of African Americans' families have had that are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit. Many of them told us the stories about how they came to own their home through their grandparents or great grandparents  who were one of  .  million people who migrated from the rural South to the industrial North  as depicted in this painting by Jacob Lawrence   The Great Migration.  They came to Detroit for a better way of life. Many found work in the automobile industry  the Ford Motor Company  as depicted in this mural by Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Art. The fruits of their labors would afford them a home  for many the first piece of property that they would ever know  and a community with other first time African American home buyers. The first couple of decades of their life in the North is quite well  up until about       which coincides with the city's peak population at  .  million people. Now it's at this time that Detroit begins to see a second kind of migration  a migration to the suburbs. Between      and       the region grows by    percent. But this time  the migration leaves African Americans in place  as families and businesses flee the city  leaving the city pretty desolate of people as well as jobs. During that same period  between      and             the city loses    percent of its population  and today it hovers at above        . The audience members who come and talk to us that night tell us the stories of what it's like to live in a city with such depleted population. Many tell us that they're one of only a few homes on their block that are occupied  and that they can see several abandoned homes from where they sit on their porches. Citywide  there are        vacant homes. They can also see vacant property. They're beginning to see illegal activities on these properties  like illegal dumping  and they know that because the city has lost so much population  their costs for water  electricity  gas are rising  because there are not enough people to pay property taxes to help support the services that they need. Citywide  there are about         vacant parcels. Now  to quickly give you all a sense of a scale  because I know that sounds like a big number  but I don't think you quite understand until you look at the city map. So the city is     square miles. You can fit Boston  San Francisco  and the island of Manhattan within its footprint. So if we take all of that vacant and abandoned property and we smush it together  it looks like about    square miles  and that's roughly equivalent to the size of the island we're sitting on today  Manhattan  at    square miles. So it's a lot of vacancy. Now some of our audience members also tell us about some of the positive things that are happening in their communities  and many of them are banding together to take control of some of the vacant lots  and they're starting community gardens  which are creating a great sense of community stewardship  but they're very  very clear to tell us that this is not enough  that they want to see their neighborhoods return to the way that their grandparents had found them. Now there's been a lot of speculation since      about what to do with the vacant property  and a lot of that speculation has been around community gardening  or what we call urban agriculture. So many people would say to us   What if you just take all that vacant land and you could make it farmland  It can provide fresh foods  and it can put Detroiters back to work too.  When I hear that story  I always imagine the folks from the Great Migration rolling over in their graves  because you can imagine that they didn't sacrifice moving from the South to the North to create a better life for their families  only to see their great grandchildren return to an agrarian lifestyle  especially in a city where they came with little less than a high school education or even a grammar school education and were able to afford the basic elements of the American dream  steady work and a home that they owned. Now  there's a third wave of migration happening in Detroit  a new ascendant of cultural entrepreneurs. These folks see that same vacant land and those same abandoned homes as opportunity for new  entrepreneurial ideas and profit  so much so that former models can move to Detroit  buy property  start successful businesses and restaurants  and become successful community activists in their neighborhood  bringing about very positive change. Similarly  we have small manufacturing companies making conscious decisions to relocate to the city. This company  Shinola  which is a luxury watch and bicycle company  deliberately chose to relocate to Detroit  and they quote themselves by saying they were drawn to the global brand  of Detroit's innovation. And they also knew that  they can tap into a workforce that was still very skilled in how to make things. Now we have community stewardship happening in neighborhoods  we have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions to move to the city and create enterprises  and we have businesses relocating  and this is all in the context of what is no secret to us all  a city that's under the control of an emergency manager  and just this July filed for Chapter   bankruptcy. So       we started this process  and by       we released Detroit Future City  which was our strategic plan to guide the city into a better and more prosperous and more sustainable existence    not what it was  but what it could be  looking at new ways of economic growth  new forms of land use  more sustainable and denser neighborhoods  a reconfigured infrastructure and city service system  and a heightened capacity for civic leaders to take action and implement change. Three key imperatives were really important to our work. One was that the city itself wasn't necessarily too large  but the economy was too small. There are only    jobs per     people in Detroit  very different from a Denver or an Atlanta or a Philadelphia that are anywhere between     to    jobs per     people. Secondly  there had to be an acceptance that we were not going to be able to use all of this vacant land in the way that we had before and maybe for some time to come. It wasn't going to be our traditional residential neighborhoods as we had before  and urban agriculture  while a very productive and successful intervention happening in Detroit  was not the only answer  that what we had to do is look at these areas where we had significant vacancy but still had a significant number of population of what could be new  productive  innovative  and entrepreneurial uses that could stabilize those communities  where still nearly         residents lived. So we came up with one neighborhood typology    there are several    called a live make neighborhood  where folks could reappropriate abandoned structures and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises  with a specific emphasis on looking at the  again  majority    percent African American population. So they  too  could take businesses that they maybe were doing out of their home and grow them to more prosperous industries and actually acquire property so they were actually property owners as well as business owners in the communities with which they resided. Then we also wanted to look at other ways of using land in addition to growing food and transforming landscape into much more productive uses  so that it could be used for storm water management  for example  by using surface lakes and retention ponds  that created neighborhood amenities  places of recreation  and actually helped to elevate adjacent property levels. Or we could use it as research plots  where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils  or we could use it to generate energy. So the descendants of the Great Migration could either become precision watchmakers at Shinola  like Willie H.  who was featured in one of their ads last year  or they can actually grow a business that would service companies like Shinola. The good news is  there is a future for the next generation of Detroiters  both those there now and those that want to come. So no thank you  Mayor Menino  who recently was quoted as saying   I'd blow up the place and start over.  There are very important people  business and land assets in Detroit  and there are real opportunities there. So while Detroit might not be what it was  Detroit will not die. Thank you. Einstein said that  I never think about the future   it comes soon enough.  And he was right  of course. So today  I'm here to ask you to think of how the future is happening now. Over the past     years  the world has experienced two major waves of innovation. First  the Industrial Revolution brought us machines and factories  railways  electricity  air travel  and our lives have never been the same. Then the Internet revolution brought us computing power  data networks  unprecedented access to information and communication  and our lives have never been the same. Now we are experiencing another metamorphic change  the industrial Internet. It brings together intelligent machines  advanced analytics  and the creativity of people at work. It's the marriage of minds and machines. And our lives will never be the same. In my current role  I see up close how technology is beginning to transform industrial sectors that play a huge role in our economy and in our lives  energy  aviation  transportation  health care. For an economist  this is highly unusual  and it's extremely exciting  because this is a transformation as powerful as the Industrial Revolution and more  and before the Industrial Revolution  there was no economic growth to speak of. So what is this industrial Internet  Industrial machines are being equipped with a growing number of electronic sensors that allow them to see  hear  feel a lot more than ever before  generating prodigious amounts of data. Increasingly sophisticated analytics then sift through the data  providing insights that allow us to operate the machines in entirely new ways  a lot more efficiently. And not just individual machines  but fleets of locomotives  airplanes  entire systems like power grids  hospitals. It is asset optimization and system optimization. Of course  electronic sensors have been around for some time  but something has changed  a sharp decline in the cost of sensors and  thanks to advances in cloud computing  a rapid decrease in the cost of storing and processing data. So we are moving to a world where the machines we work with are not just intelligent  they are brilliant. They are self aware  they are predictive  reactive and social. It's jet engines  locomotives  gas turbines  medical devices  communicating seamlessly with each other and with us. It's a world where information itself becomes intelligent and comes to us automatically when we need it without having to look for it. We are beginning to deploy throughout the industrial system embedded virtualization  multi core processor technology  advanced cloud based communications  a new software defined machine infrastructure which allows machine functionality to become virtualized in software  decoupling machine software from hardware  and allowing us to remotely and automatically monitor  manage and upgrade industrial assets. Why does any of this matter at all  Well first of all  it's already allowing us to shift towards preventive  condition based maintenance  which means fixing machines just before they break  without wasting time servicing them on a fixed schedule. And this  in turn  is pushing us towards zero unplanned downtime  which means there will be no more power outages  no more flight delays. So let me give you a few examples of how these brilliant machines work  and some of the examples may seem trivial  some are clearly more profound  but all of them are going to have a very powerful impact. Let's start with aviation. Today     percent of all flights cancellations and delays are due to unscheduled maintenance events. Something goes wrong unexpectedly. This results in eight billion dollars in costs for the airline industry globally every year  not to mention the impact on all of us  stress  inconvenience  missed meetings as we sit helplessly in an airport terminal. So how can the industrial Internet help here  We've developed a preventive maintenance system which can be installed on any aircraft. It's self learning and able to predict issues that a human operator would miss. The aircraft  while in flight  will communicate with technicians on the ground. By the time it lands  they will already know if anything needs to be serviced. Just in the U.S.  a system like this can prevent over        delays and cancellations every year  helping seven million passengers get to their destinations on time. Or take healthcare. Today  nurses spend an average of    minutes per shift looking for medical equipment. That seems trivial  but it's less time spent caring for patients. St. Luke's Medical Center in Houston  Texas  which has deployed industrial Internet technology to electronically monitor and connect patients  staff and medical equipment  has reduced bed turnaround times by nearly one hour. If you need surgery  one hour matters. It means more patients can be treated  more lives can be saved. Another medical center  in Washington state  is piloting an application that allows medical images from city scanners and MRIs to be analyzed in the cloud  developing better analytics at a lower cost. Imagine a patient who has suffered a severe trauma  and needs the attention of several specialists  a neurologist  a cardiologist  an orthopedic surgeon. If all of them can have instantaneous and simultaneous access to scans and images as they are taken  they will be able to deliver better healthcare faster. So all of this translates into better health outcomes  but it can also deliver substantial economic benefits. Just a one percent reduction in existing inefficiencies could yield savings of over    billion dollars to the healthcare industry worldwide  and that is just a drop in the sea compared to what we need to do to make healthcare affordable on a sustainable basis. Similar advances are happening in energy  including renewable energy. Wind farms equipped with new remote monitorings and diagnostics that allow wind turbines to talk to each other and adjust the pitch of their blades in a coordinated way  depending on how the wind is blowing  can now produce electricity at a cost of less than five cents per kilowatt hour. Ten years ago  that cost was    cents  six times as much. The list goes on  and it will grow fast  because industrial data are now growing exponentially. By       they will account for over    percent of all digital information. But this is not just about data  so let me switch gears and tell you how this is impacting already the jobs we do every day  because this new wave of innovation is bringing about new tools and applications that will allow us to collaborate in a smarter and faster way  making our jobs not just more efficient but more rewarding. Imagine a field engineer arriving at the wind farm with a handheld device telling her which turbines need servicing. She already has all the spare parts  because the problems were diagnosed in advanced. And if she faces an unexpected issue  the same handheld device will allow her to communicate with colleagues at the service center  let them see what she sees  transmit data that they can run through diagnostics  and they can stream videos that will guide her  step by step  through whatever complex procedure is needed to get the machines back up and running. And their interaction gets documented and stored in a searchable database. Let's stop and think about this for a minute  because this is a very important point. This new wave of innovation is fundamentally changing the way we work. And I know that many of you will be concerned  about the impact that innovation might have on jobs. Unemployment is already high  and there is always a fear  that innovation will destroy jobs. And innovation is disruptive. But let me stress two things here. First  we've already lived through mechanization of agriculture  automation of industry  and employment has gone up  because innovation is fundamentally about growth. It makes products more affordable. It creates new demand  new jobs. Second  there is a concern that in the future  there will only be room for engineers  data scientists  and other highly specialized workers. And believe me  as an economist  I am also scared. But think about it  Just as a child can easily figure out how to operate an iPad  so a new generation of mobile and intuitive industrial applications will make life easier for workers of all skill levels. The worker of the future will be more like Iron Man than the Charlie Chaplin of  Modern Times.  And to be sure  new high skilled jobs will be created  mechanical digital engineers who understand both the machines and the data  managers who understand their industry and the analytics and can reorganize the business to take full advantage of the technology. But now let's take a step back. Let's look at the big picture. There are people who argue that today's innovation is all about social media and silly games  with nowhere near the transformational power of the Industrial Revolution. They say that all the growth enhancing innovations are behind us. And every time I hear this  I can't help thinking that even back in the Stone Age  there must have been a group of cavemen sitting around a fire one day looking very grumpy  and looking disapprovingly at another group of cavemen rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill  and saying to each other   Yeah  this wheel thing  cool toy  sure  but compared to fire  it will have no impact. The big discoveries are all behind us.  This technological revolution is as inspiring and transformational as anything we have ever seen. Human creativity and innovation have always propelled us forward. They've created jobs. They've raised living standards. They've made our lives healthier and more rewarding. And the new wave of innovation which is beginning to sweep through industry is no different. In the U.S. alone  the industrial Internet could raise average income by    to    percent over the next    years  boosting growth to rates we haven't seen in a long time  and adding between    and    trillion dollars to global GDP. That is the size of the entire U.S. economy today. But this is not a foregone conclusion. We are just at the beginning of this transformation  and there will be barriers to break  obstacles to overcome. We will need to invest in the new technologies. We will need to adapt organizations and managerial practices. We will need a robust cybersecurity approach that protects sensitive information and intellectual property and safeguards critical infrastructure from cyberattacks. And the education system will need to evolve to ensure students are equipped with the right skills. It's not going to be easy  but it is going to be worth it. The economic challenges facing us are hard  but when I walk the factory floor  and I see how humans and brilliant machines are becoming interconnected  and I see the difference this makes in a hospital  in an airport  in a power generation plant  I'm not just optimistic  I'm enthusiastic. This new technological revolution is upon us. So think about the future   it will be here soon enough. Thank you.  I felt a Funeral  in my Brain  and Mourners to and fro kept treading    treading    till  it seemed  that Sense was breaking through    And when they all were seated  a Service  like a Drum    kept beating    beating    till I  thought  my Mind was going numb    And then I heard them lift a Box and creak across my Soul with those same Boots of Lead  again  then Space    began to toll  As  all  the Heavens were a Bell  and Being   but  an Ear  and I  and Silence  some strange Race  wrecked  solitary  here     And  then a Plank in Reason  broke  and I fell down and down    and hit a World  at every plunge  and Finished knowing    then     We know depression through metaphors. Emily Dickinson was able to convey it in language  Goya in an image. Half the purpose of art is to describe such iconic states. As for me  I had always thought myself tough  one of the people who could survive if I'd been sent to a concentration camp. In       I had a series of losses. My mother died  a relationship I'd been in ended  I moved back to the United States from some years abroad  and I got through all of those experiences intact. But in       three years later  I found myself losing interest in almost everything. I didn't want to do any of the things I had previously wanted to do  and I didn't know why. The opposite of depression is not happiness  but vitality. And it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment. Everything there was to do seemed like too much work. I would come home and I would see the red light flashing on my answering machine  and instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends  I would think   What a lot of people that is to have to call back.  Or I would decide I should have lunch  and then I would think  but I'd have to get the food out and put it on a plate and cut it up and chew it and swallow it  and it felt to me like the Stations of the Cross. And one of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression is that you know it's ridiculous. You know it's ridiculous while you're experiencing it. You know that most people manage to listen to their messages and eat lunch and organize themselves to take a shower and go out the front door and that it's not a big deal  and yet you are nonetheless in its grip and you are unable to figure out any way around it. And so I began to feel myself doing less and thinking less and feeling less. It was a kind of nullity. And then the anxiety set in. If you told me that I'd have to be depressed for the next month  I would say   As long I know it'll be over in November  I can do it.  But if you said to me   You have to have acute anxiety for the next month   I would rather slit my wrist than go through it. It was the feeling all the time like that feeling you have if you're walking and you slip or trip and the ground is rushing up at you  but instead of lasting half a second  the way that does  it lasted for six months. It's a sensation of being afraid all the time but not even knowing what it is that you're afraid of. And it was at that point that I began to think that it was just too painful to be alive  and that the only reason not to kill oneself was so as not to hurt other people. And finally one day  I woke up and I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke  because I lay in bed completely frozen  looking at the telephone  thinking   Something is wrong and I should call for help   and I couldn't reach out my arm and pick up the phone and dial. And finally  after four full hours of my lying and staring at it  the phone rang  and somehow I managed to pick it up  and it was my father  and I said   I'm in serious trouble. We need to do something.  The next day I started with the medications and the therapy. And I also started reckoning with this terrible question  If I'm not the tough person who could have made it through a concentration camp  then who am I  And if I have to take medication  is that medication making me more fully myself  or is it making me someone else  And how do I feel about it if it's making me someone else  I had two advantages as I went into the fight. The first is that I knew that  objectively speaking  I had a nice life  and that if I could only get well  there was something at the other end that was worth living for. And the other was that I had access to good treatment. But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed  and emerged and relapsed  and emerged and relapsed  and finally understood I would have to be on medication and in therapy forever. And I thought   But is it a chemical problem or a psychological problem  And does it need a chemical cure or a philosophical cure   And I couldn't figure out which it was. And then I understood that actually  we aren't advanced enough in either area for it to explain things fully. The chemical cure and the psychological cure both have a role to play  and I also figured out that depression was something that was braided so deep into us that there was no separating it from our character and personality. I want to say that the treatments we have for depression are appalling. They're not very effective. They're extremely costly. They come with innumerable side effects. They're a disaster. But I am so grateful that I live now and not    years ago  when there would have been almost nothing to be done. I hope that    years hence  people will hear about my treatments and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science. Depression is the flaw in love. If you were married to someone and thought   Well  if my wife dies  I'll find another one   it wouldn't be love as we know it. There's no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss  and that specter of despair can be the engine of intimacy. There are three things people tend to confuse  depression  grief and sadness. Grief is explicitly reactive. If you have a loss and you feel incredibly unhappy  and then  six months later  you are still deeply sad  but you're functioning a little better  it's probably grief  and it will probably ultimately resolve itself in some measure. If you experience a catastrophic loss  and you feel terrible  and six months later you can barely function at all  then it's probably a depression that was triggered by the catastrophic circumstances. The trajectory tells us a great deal. People think of depression as being just sadness. It's much  much too much sadness  much too much grief at far too slight a cause. As I set out to understand depression  and to interview people who had experienced it  I found that there were people who seemed  on the surface  to have what sounded like relatively mild depression who were nonetheless utterly disabled by it. And there were other people who had what sounded as they described it like terribly severe depression who nonetheless had good lives in the interstices between their depressive episodes. And I set out to find out what it is that causes some people to be more resilient than other people. What are the mechanisms that allow people to survive  And I went out and I interviewed person after person who was suffering with depression. One of the first people I interviewed described depression as a slower way of being dead  and that was a good thing for me to hear early on because it reminded me that that slow way of being dead can lead to actual deadness  that this is a serious business. It's the leading disability worldwide  and people die of it every day. One of the people I talked to when I was trying to understand this was a beloved friend who I had known for many years  and who had had a psychotic episode in her freshman year of college  and then plummeted into a horrific depression. She had bipolar illness  or manic depression  as it was then known. And then she did very well for many years on lithium  and then eventually  she was taken off her lithium to see how she would do without it  and she had another psychosis  and then plunged into the worst depression that I had ever seen in which she sat in her parents' apartment  more or less catatonic  essentially without moving  day after day after day. And when I interviewed her about that experience some years later    she's a poet and psychotherapist named Maggie Robbins    when I interviewed her  she said   I was singing 'Where Have All The Flowers Gone ' over and over  to occupy my mind. I was singing to blot out the things my mind was saying  which were  'You are nothing. You are nobody. You don't even deserve to live.' And that was when I really started thinking about killing myself.  You don't think in depression that you've put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood. You think that the veil has been taken away  the veil of happiness  and that now you're seeing truly. It's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive that there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised  but it's difficult with depressives  because we believe we are seeing the truth. But the truth lies. I became obsessed with that sentence   But the truth lies.  And I discovered  as I talked to depressive people  that they have many delusional perceptions. People will say   No one loves me.  And you say   I love you  your wife loves you  your mother loves you.  You can answer that one pretty readily  at least for most people. But people who are depressed will also say   No matter what we do  we're all just going to die in the end.  Or they'll say   There can be no true communion between two human beings. Each of us is trapped in his own body.  To which you have to say   That's true  but I think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast.  A lot of the time  what they are expressing is not illness  but insight  and one comes to think what's really extraordinary is that most of us know about those existential questions and they don't distract us very much. There was a study I particularly liked in which a group of depressed and a group of non depressed people were asked to play a video game for an hour  and at the end of the hour  they were asked how many little monsters they thought they had killed. The depressive group was usually accurate to within about    percent  and the non depressed people guessed between    and    times as many little monsters    as they had actually killed. A lot of people said  when I chose to write about my depression  that it must be very difficult to be out of that closet  to have people know. They said   Do people talk to you differently   I said   Yes  people talk to me differently. They talk to me differently insofar as they start telling me about their experience  or their sister's experience  or their friend's experience. Things are different because now I know that depression is the family secret that everyone has. I went a few years ago to a conference  and on Friday of the three day conference  one of the participants took me aside  and she said   I suffer from depression and I'm a little embarrassed about it  but I've been taking this medication  and I just wanted to ask you what you think   And so I did my best to give her such advice as I could. And then she said   You know  my husband would never understand this. He's really the kind of guy to whom this wouldn't make any sense  so  you know  it's just between us.  And I said   Yes  that's fine.  On Sunday of the same conference  her husband took me aside  and he said   My wife wouldn't think that I was really much of a guy if she knew this  but I've been dealing with this depression and I'm taking some medication  and I wondered what you think   They were hiding the same medication in two different places in the same bedroom. And I said that I thought communication within the marriage might be triggering some of their problems. But I was also struck by the burdensome nature of such mutual secrecy. Depression is so exhausting. It takes up so much of your time and energy  and silence about it  it really does make the depression worse. And then I began thinking about all the ways people make themselves better. I'd started off as a medical conservative. I thought there were a few kinds of therapy that worked  it was clear what they were    there was medication  there were certain psychotherapies  there was possibly electroconvulsive treatment  and that everything else was nonsense. But then I discovered something. If you have brain cancer  and you say that standing on your head for    minutes every morning makes you feel better  it may make you feel better  but you still have brain cancer  and you'll still probably die from it. But if you say that you have depression  and standing on your head for    minutes every day makes you feel better  then it's worked  because depression is an illness of how you feel  and if you feel better  then you are effectively not depressed anymore. So I became much more tolerant of the vast world of alternative treatments. And I get letters  I get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about what's worked for them. Someone was asking me backstage today about meditation. My favorite of the letters that I got was the one that came from a woman who wrote and said that she had tried therapy  medication  she had tried pretty much everything  and she had found a solution and hoped I would tell the world  and that was making little things from yarn. She sent me some of them. And I'm not wearing them right now. I suggested to her that she also should look up obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM. And yet  when I went to look at alternative treatments  I also gained perspective on other treatments. I went through a tribal exorcism in Senegal that involved a great deal of ram's blood and that I'm not going to detail right now  but a few years afterwards I was in Rwanda  working on a different project  and I happened to describe my experience to someone  and he said   Well  that's West Africa  and we're in East Africa  and our rituals are in some ways very different  but we do have some rituals that have something in common with what you're describing.  And he said   But we've had a lot of trouble with Western mental health workers  especially the ones who came right after the genocide.  I said   What kind of trouble did you have   And he said   Well  they would do this bizarre thing. They didn't take people out in the sunshine where you begin to feel better. They didn't include drumming or music to get people's blood going. They didn't involve the whole community. They didn't externalize the depression as an invasive spirit. Instead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms and had them talk for an hour about bad things that had happened to them.  He said   We had to ask them to leave the country.  Now at the other end of alternative treatments  let me tell you about Frank Russakoff. Frank Russakoff had the worst depression perhaps that I've ever seen in a man. He was constantly depressed. He was  when I met him  at a point at which every month  he would have electroshock treatment. Then he would feel sort of disoriented for a week. Then he would feel okay for a week. Then he would have a week of going downhill. And then he would have another electroshock treatment. And he said to me when I met him   It's unbearable to go through my weeks this way. I can't go on this way  and I've figured out how I'm going to end it if I don't get better.   But   he said to me   I heard about a protocol at Mass General for a procedure called a cingulotomy  which is a brain surgery  and I think I'm going to give that a try.  And I remember being amazed at that point to think that someone who clearly had so many bad experiences with so many different treatments still had buried in him  somewhere  enough optimism to reach out for one more. And he had the cingulotomy  and it was incredibly successful. He's now a friend of mine. He has a lovely wife and two beautiful children. He wrote me a letter the Christmas after the surgery  and he said   My father sent me two presents this year  First  a motorized CD rack from The Sharper Image that I didn't really need  but I knew he was giving it to me to celebrate the fact that I'm living on my own and have a job I seem to love. And the other present was a photo of my grandmother  who committed suicide. As I unwrapped it  I began to cry  and my mother came over and said  'Are you crying because of the relatives you never knew ' And I said  'She had the same disease I have.' I'm crying now as I write to you. It's not that I'm so sad  but I get overwhelmed  I think  because I could have killed myself  but my parents kept me going  and so did the doctors  and I had the surgery. I'm alive and grateful. We live in the right time  even if it doesn't always feel like it.  I was struck by the fact that depression is broadly perceived to be a modern  Western  middle class thing  and I went to look at how it operated in a variety of other contexts  and one of the things I was most interested in was depression among the indigent. And so I went out to try to look at what was being done for poor people with depression. And what I discovered is that poor people are mostly not being treated for depression. Depression is the result of a genetic vulnerability  which is presumably evenly distributed in the population  and triggering circumstances  which are likely to be more severe for people who are impoverished. And yet it turns out that if you have a really lovely life but feel miserable all the time  you think   Why do I feel like this  I must have depression.  And you set out to find treatment for it. But if you have a perfectly awful life  and you feel miserable all the time  the way you feel is commensurate with your life  and it doesn't occur to you to think   Maybe this is treatable.  And so we have an epidemic in this country of depression among impoverished people that's not being picked up and that's not being treated and that's not being addressed  and it's a tragedy of a grand order. And so I found an academic who was doing a research project in slums outside of D.C.  where she picked up women who had come in for other health problems and diagnosed them with depression  and then provided six months of the experimental protocol. One of them  Lolly  came in  and this is what she said the day she came in. She said  and she was a woman  by the way  who had seven children. She said   I used to have a job but I had to give it up because I couldn't go out of the house. I have nothing to say to my children. In the morning  I can't wait for them to leave  and then I climb in bed and pull the covers over my head  and three o'clock when they come home  it just comes so fast.  She said   I've been taking a lot of Tylenol  anything I can take so that I can sleep more. My husband has been telling me I'm stupid  I'm ugly. I wish I could stop the pain.  Well  she was brought into this experimental protocol  and when I interviewed her six months later  she had taken a job working in childcare for the U.S. Navy  she had left the abusive husband  and she said to me   My kids are so much happier now.  She said   There's one room in my new place for the boys and one room for the girls  but at night  they're just all up on my bed  and we're doing homework all together and everything. One of them wants to be a preacher  one of them wants to be a firefighter  and one of the girls says she's going to be a lawyer. They don't cry like they used to  and they don't fight like they did. That's all I need now  is my kids. Things keep on changing  the way I dress  the way I feel  the way I act. I can go outside not being afraid anymore  and I don't think those bad feelings are coming back  and if it weren't for Dr. Miranda and that  I would still be at home with the covers pulled over my head  if I were still alive at all. I asked the Lord to send me an angel  and He heard my prayers.  I was really moved by these experiences  and I decided that I wanted to write about them not only in a book I was working on  but also in an article  and I got a commission from The New York Times Magazine to write about depression among the indigent. And I turned in my story  and my editor called me and said   We really can't publish this.  And I said   Why not   And she said   It just is too far fetched. These people who are sort of at the very bottom rung of society and then they get a few months of treatment and they're virtually ready to run Morgan Stanley  It's just too implausible.  She said   I've never even heard of anything like it.  And I said   The fact that you've never heard of it is an indication that it is news.   And you are a news magazine.  So after a certain amount of negotiation  they agreed to it. But I think a lot of what they said was connected in some strange way to this distaste that people still have for the idea of treatment  the notion that somehow if we went out and treated a lot of people in indigent communities  that would be exploitative  because we would be changing them. There is this false moral imperative that seems to be all around us  that treatment of depression  the medications and so on  are an artifice  and that it's not natural. And I think that's very misguided. It would be natural for people's teeth to fall out  but there is nobody militating against toothpaste  at least not in my circles. People then say   But isn't depression part of what people are supposed to experience  Didn't we evolve to have depression  Isn't it part of your personality   To which I would say  mood is adaptive. Being able to have sadness and fear and joy and pleasure and all of the other moods that we have  that's incredibly valuable. And major depression is something that happens when that system gets broken. It's maladaptive. People will come to me and say   I think  though  if I just stick it out for another year  I think I can just get through this.  And I always say to them   You may get through it  but you'll never be    again. Life is short  and that's a whole year you're talking about giving up. Think it through.  It's a strange poverty of the English language  and indeed of many other languages  that we use this same word  depression  to describe how a kid feels when it rains on his birthday  and to describe how somebody feels the minute before they commit suicide. People say to me   Well  is it continuous with normal sadness   And I say  in a way it's continuous with normal sadness. There is a certain amount of continuity  but it's the same way there's continuity between having an iron fence outside your house that gets a little rust spot that you have to sand off and do a little repainting  and what happens if you leave the house for     years and it rusts through until it's only a pile of orange dust. And it's that orange dust spot  that orange dust problem  that's the one we're setting out to address. So now people say   You take these happy pills  and do you feel happy   And I don't. But I don't feel sad about having to eat lunch  and I don't feel sad about my answering machine  and I don't feel sad about taking a shower. I feel more  in fact  I think  because I can feel sadness without nullity. I feel sad about professional disappointments  about damaged relationships  about global warming. Those are the things that I feel sad about now. And I said to myself  well  what is the conclusion  How did those people who have better lives even with bigger depression manage to get through  What is the mechanism of resilience  And what I came up with over time was that the people who deny their experience  and say   I was depressed a long time ago  I never want to think about it again  I'm not going to look at it and I'm just going to get on with my life   ironically  those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have. Shutting out the depression strengthens it. While you hide from it  it grows. And the people who do better are the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have this condition. Those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience. So Frank Russakoff said to me   If I had a do over  I suppose I wouldn't do it this way  but in a strange way  I'm grateful for what I've experienced. I'm glad to have been in the hospital    times. It taught me so much about love  and my relationship with my parents and my doctors has been so precious to me  and will be always.  And Maggie Robbins said   I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic  and I would just talk and talk and talk  and the people I was dealing with weren't very responsive  and I thought  'That's not very friendly or helpful of them.'   And then I realized  I realized that they weren't going to do more than make those first few minutes of small talk. It was simply going to be an occasion where I didn't have AIDS and I wasn't dying  but could tolerate the fact that they did and they were. Our needs are our greatest assets. It turns out I've learned to give all the things I need.  Valuing one's depression does not prevent a relapse  but it may make the prospect of relapse and even relapse itself easier to tolerate. The question is not so much of finding great meaning and deciding your depression has been very meaningful. It's of seeking that meaning and thinking  when it comes again   This will be hellish  but I will learn something from it.  I have learned in my own depression how big an emotion can be  how it can be more real than facts  and I have found that that experience has allowed me to experience positive emotion in a more intense and more focused way. The opposite of depression is not happiness  but vitality  and these days  my life is vital  even on the days when I'm sad. I felt that funeral in my brain  and I sat next to the colossus at the edge of the world  and I have discovered something inside of myself that I would have to call a soul that I had never formulated until that day    years ago when hell came to pay me a surprise visit. I think that while I hated being depressed and would hate to be depressed again  I've found a way to love my depression. I love it because it has forced me to find and cling to joy. I love it because each day I decide  sometimes gamely  and sometimes against the moment's reason  to cleave to the reasons for living. And that  I think  is a highly privileged rapture. Thank you. Thank you. Nine years ago  I worked for the U.S. government in Iraq  helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure. And I was there  and I worked in that job because I believe that technology can improve people's lives. One afternoon  I had tea with a storekeeper at the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad  and he said to me   You Americans  you can put a man on the moon  but when I get home tonight  I won't be able to turn on my lights.  At the time  the U.S. government had spent more than two billion dollars on electricity reconstruction. How do you ensure technology reaches users  How do you put it in their hands so that it is useful  So those are the questions that my colleagues and I at D Rev ask ourselves. And D Rev is short for Design Revolution. And I took over the organization four years ago and really focused it on developing products that actually reach users  and not just any users  but customers who live on less than four dollars a day. One of the key areas we've been working on recently is medical devices  and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with Iraq's electricity grid then  there are some commonalities. Despite the advanced technology  it's not reaching the people who need it most. So I'm going to tell you about one of the projects we've been working on  the ReMotion Knee  and it's a prosthetic knee for above knee amputees. And this project started when the Jaipur Foot Organization  the largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world  came to the Bay Area and they said   We need a better knee.  Chances are  if you're living on less than four dollars a day  and you're an amputee  you've lost your limb in a vehicle accident. Most people think it's land mines  but it's a vehicle accident. You're walking by the side of the road and you're hit by a truck  or you're trying to to jump on a moving train  you're late for work  and your pant leg gets caught. And the reality is that if you don't have much money  like this young named Kamal right here  the option you really have is a bamboo staff to get around. And how big a problem is this  There's over three million amputees every year who need a new or replacement knee. And what are their options  This is a high end. This is what we'd call a  smart knee.  It's got a microprocessor inside. It can pretty much do anything  but it's        dollars  and to give you a sense of who wears this  veterans  American veterans coming back from Afghanistan or Iraq would be fit with something like this. This is a low end titanium knee. It's a polycentric knee  and all that that means is the mechanism  is a four bar mechanism  that mimics a natural human knee. But at       dollars  it's still too expensive for people like Kamal. And lastly  here you see a low end knee. This is a knee that's been designed specifically for poor people. And while you have affordability  you've lost on functionality. The mechanism here is a single axis  and a single axis is like a door hinge. So you can think about how unstable that would be. And this is the type of mechanism that the Jaipur Foot Organization was using when they were looking for a better knee  and I just wanted to give you a sense of what a leg system looks like  because I'm showing you all these knees and I imagine it's hard to think  how it all fits together. So at the top you have a socket  and this fits over someone's residual limb  and everyone's residual limb is a little bit different. And then you have the knee  and here I've got a single axis on the knee so you can see how it rotates  and then a pylon  and then a foot. And we've been able to develop a knee  a polycentric knee  so that type of knee that acts like a human knee  mimics human gait  for    dollars retail. But the key is  you can have this great invention  you can have this great design  but how do you get it to the people who most need it  How do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives  So at D Rev  we've done some other projects  and we looked at three things that we really believe gets technologies to customers  to users  to people who need it. And the first thing is that the product  needs to be world class. It needs to perform on par or better than the best products on the market. Regardless of your income level  you want the most beautiful  the best product that there is. I'm going to show you a video now of a man named Ash. You can see him walking. He's wearing the same knee system here with a single axis knee. And he's doing a    meter walk test. And you'll notice that he's struggling  with stability as he's walking. And something that's not obvious  that you can't see  is that it's psychologically draining to walk and to be preventing yourself from falling. Now this is a video of Kamal. You remember Kamal earlier  holding the bamboo staff. He's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee  and he's doing that same    meter walk test. And you can see his stability is much better. So world class isn't just about technical performance. It's also about human performance. And most medical devices  we've learned  as we've dug in  are really designed for Westerners  for wealthier economies. But the reality is our users  our customers  they do different things. They sit cross legged more. We see that they squat. They kneel in prayer. And we designed our knee to have the greatest range of motion of almost any other knee on the market. So the second thing we learned  and this leads into my second point  which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be user centric. And at D Rev  we go one step further and we say you need to be user obsessed. So it's not just the end user that you're thinking about  but everyone who interacts with the product  so  for example  the prosthetist who fits the knee  but also the context in which the knee is being fit. What is the local market like  How do all these components get to the clinic  Do they all get there on time  The supply chain. Everything that goes into ensuring that this product gets to the end user  and it goes in as part of the system  and it's used. So I wanted to show you some of the iterations we did between the first version  the Jaipur Knee  so this is it right here. Notice anything about it  It clicks. We'd seen that users had actually modified it. So do you see that black strip right there  That's a homemade noise dampener. We also saw that our users had modified it in other ways. You can see there that that particular amputee  he had wrapped bandages around the knee. He'd made a cosmesis. And if you look at the knee  it's got those pointy edges  right  So if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt or a sari  it's really obvious that you're wearing a prosthetic limb  and in societies where there's social stigma around being disabled  people are particularly acute about this. So I'm going to show you some of the modifications we did. We did a lot of iterations  not just  around this  but some other things. But here we have the version three   the ReMotion Knee  but if you look in here  you can see the noise dampener. It's quieter. The other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile. We made it thinner. And something that's not obvious is that we designed it for mass production. And this goes into my last point. We really  truly believe that if a product is going to reach users at the scale that it's needed  it needs to be market driven  and market driven means that products are sold. They're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized. Our product needs to be designed to offer value to the end user. It also has to be designed to be very affordable. But a product that is valued by a customer is used by a customer  and use is what creates impact. And we believe that as designers  it holds us accountable to our customers. And with centralized manufacturing  you can control the quality control  and you can hit that     price point with profit margins built in. And now  those profit margins are critical  because if you want to scale  if you want to reach all the people in the world who possibly need a knee  it needs to be economically sustainable. So I want to give you a sense of where we are at. We have fit over       amputees  and one of the big indicators we're looking at  of course  is  does it improve lives  Well  the standard is  is someone still wearing their knee six months later  The industry average is about    percent. Ours is    percent  and we're hoping to get that higher. Right now  our knees are worn in    countries. This is where we want to get  though  in the next three years. We'll double the impact in       and we'll double it each of the following years after that. But then we hit a new challenge  and that's the number of skilled prosthetists who are able to fit knees. So I want to end with a story of Pournima. Pournima was    years old when she was in a car accident where she lost her leg  and she traveled    hours by train to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee  and while all of the amputees who wear our knees affect us as the designers  she's particularly meaningful to me  as an engineer and as a woman  because she was in school  she had just started school to study engineering. And she said   Well  now that I can walk again  I can go back and complete my studies.  And to me she represents the next generation of engineers solving problems and ensuring meaningful technologies reach their users. So thank you. I want you to  for a moment  think about playing a game of Monopoly  except in this game  that combination of skill  talent and luck that help earn you success in games  as in life  has been rendered irrelevant  because this game's been rigged  and you've got the upper hand. You've got more money  more opportunities to move around the board  and more access to resources. And as you think about that experience  I want you to ask yourself  how might that experience of being a privileged player in a rigged game change the way that you think about yourself and regard that other player  So we ran a study on the U.C. Berkeley campus to look at exactly that question. We brought in more than     pairs of strangers into the lab  and with the flip of a coin randomly assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged game. They got two times as much money. When they passed Go  they collected twice the salary  and they got to roll both dice instead of one  so they got to move around the board a lot more. And over the course of    minutes  we watched through hidden cameras what happened. And what I want to do today  for the first time  is show you a little bit of what we saw. You're going to have to pardon the sound quality  in some cases  because again  these were hidden cameras. So we've provided subtitles. Rich Player  How many    s did you have  Poor Player  Just one. Rich Player  Are you serious. Poor Player  Yeah. Rich Player  I have three.  Laughs  I don't know why they gave me so much. Paul Piff  Okay  so it was quickly apparent to players that something was up. One person clearly has a lot more money than the other person  and yet  as the game unfolded  we saw very notable differences and dramatic differences begin to emerge between the two players. The rich player started to move around the board louder  literally smacking the board with their piece as he went around. We were more likely to see signs of dominance and nonverbal signs  displays of power and celebration among the rich players. We had a bowl of pretzels positioned off to the side. It's on the bottom right corner there. That allowed us to watch participants' consummatory behavior. So we're just tracking how many pretzels participants eat. Rich Player  Are those pretzels a trick  Poor Player  I don't know. PP  Okay  so no surprises  people are onto us. They wonder what that bowl of pretzels is doing there in the first place. One even asks  like you just saw  is that bowl of pretzels there as a trick  And yet  despite that  the power of the situation seems to inevitably dominate  and those rich players start to eat more pretzels. Rich Player  I love pretzels. PP  And as the game went on  one of the really interesting and dramatic patterns that we observed begin to emerge was that the rich players actually started to become ruder toward the other person  less and less sensitive to the plight of those poor  poor players  and more and more demonstrative of their material success  more likely to showcase how well they're doing. Rich Player  I have money for everything. Poor Player  How much is that  Rich Player  You owe me    dollars. You're going to lose all your money soon. I'll buy it. I have so much money. I have so much money  it takes me forever. Rich Player    I'm going to buy out this whole board. Rich Player    You're going to run out of money soon. I'm pretty much untouchable at this point. PP  Okay  and here's what I think was really  really interesting  is that at the end of the    minutes  we asked the players to talk about their experience during the game. And when the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won in this rigged game of Monopoly    they talked about what they'd done to buy those different properties and earn their success in the game  and they became far less attuned to all those different features of the situation  including that flip of a coin that had randomly gotten them into that privileged position in the first place. And that's a really  really incredible insight into how the mind makes sense of advantage. Now this game of Monopoly can be used as a metaphor for understanding society and its hierarchical structure  wherein some people have a lot of wealth and a lot of status  and a lot of people don't. They have a lot less wealth and a lot less status and a lot less access to valued resources. And what my colleagues and I for the last seven years have been doing is studying the effects of these kinds of hierarchies. What we've been finding across dozens of studies and thousands of participants across this country is that as a person's levels of wealth increase  their feelings of compassion and empathy go down  and their feelings of entitlement  of deservingness  and their ideology of self interest increases. In surveys  we found that it's actually wealthier individuals who are more likely to moralize greed being good  and that the pursuit of self interest is favorable and moral. Now what I want to do today is talk about some of the implications of this ideology self interest  talk about why we should care about those implications  and end with what might be done. Some of the first studies that we ran in this area looked at helping behavior  something social psychologists call pro social behavior. And we were really interested in who's more likely to offer help to another person  someone who's rich or someone who's poor. In one of the studies  we bring in rich and poor members of the community into the lab and give each of them the equivalent of    dollars. We told the participants that they could keep these    dollars for themselves  or they could share a portion of it  if they wanted to  with a stranger who is totally anonymous. They'll never meet that stranger and the stranger will never meet them. And we just monitor how much people give. Individuals who made        sometimes under        dollars a year  gave    percent more of their money to the stranger than did individuals making         or         dollars a year. We've had people play games to see who's more or less likely to cheat to increase their chances of winning a prize. In one of the games  we actually rigged a computer so that die rolls over a certain score were impossible. You couldn't get above    in this game  and yet  the richer you were  the more likely you were to cheat in this game to earn credits toward a     cash prize  sometimes by three to four times as much. We ran another study where we looked at whether people would be inclined to take candy from a jar of candy that we explicitly identified as being reserved for children    participating    I'm not kidding. I know it sounds like I'm making a joke. We explicitly told participants this jar of candy's for children participating in a developmental lab nearby. They're in studies. This is for them. And we just monitored how much candy participants took. Participants who felt rich took two times as much candy as participants who felt poor. We've even studied cars  not just any cars  but whether drivers of different kinds of cars are more or less inclined to break the law. In one of these studies  we looked at whether drivers would stop for a pedestrian that we had posed waiting to cross at a crosswalk. Now in California  as you all know  because I'm sure we all do this  it's the law to stop for a pedestrian who's waiting to cross. So here's an example of how we did it. That's our confederate off to the left posing as a pedestrian. He approaches as the red truck successfully stops. In typical California fashion  it's overtaken by the bus who almost runs our pedestrian over. Now here's an example of a more expensive car  a Prius  driving through  and a BMW doing the same. So we did this for hundreds of vehicles on several days  just tracking who stops and who doesn't. What we found was that as the expensiveness of a car increased  the driver's tendencies to break the law increased as well. None of the cars  none of the cars in our least expensive car category broke the law. Close to    percent of the cars in our most expensive vehicle category broke the law. We've run other studies finding that wealthier individuals are more likely to lie in negotiations  to endorse unethical behavior at work like stealing cash from the cash register  taking bribes  lying to customers. Now I don't mean to suggest that it's only wealthy people who show these patterns of behavior. Not at all. In fact  I think that we all  in our day to day  minute by minute lives  struggle with these competing motivations of when  or if  to put our own interests above the interests of other people. And that's understandable because the American dream is an idea in which we all have an equal opportunity to succeed and prosper  as long as we apply ourselves and work hard  and a piece of that means that sometimes  you need to put your own interests above the interests and well being of other people around you. But what we're finding is that  the wealthier you are  the more likely you are to pursue a vision of personal success  of achievement and accomplishment  to the detriment of others around you. Here I've plotted for you the mean household income received by each fifth and top five percent of the population over the last    years. In       the differences between the different quintiles of the population  in terms of income  are fairly egregious. It's not difficult to discern that there are differences. But over the last    years  that significant difference has become a grand canyon of sorts between those at the top and everyone else. In fact  the top    percent of our population own close to    percent of the total wealth in this country. We're at unprecedented levels of economic inequality. What that means is that wealth is not only becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a select group of individuals  but the American dream is becoming increasingly unattainable for an increasing majority of us. And if it's the case  as we've been finding  that the wealthier you are  the more entitled you feel to that wealth  and the more likely you are to prioritize your own interests above the interests of other people  and be willing to do things to serve that self interest  well then there's no reason to think that those patterns will change. In fact  there's every reason to think that they'll only get worse  and that's what it would look like if things just stayed the same  at the same linear rate  over the next    years. Now  inequality  economic inequality  is something we should all be concerned about  and not just because of those at the bottom of the social hierarchy  but because individuals and groups with lots of economic inequality do worse  not just the people at the bottom  everyone. There's a lot of really compelling research coming out from top labs all over the world showcasing the range of things that are undermined as economic inequality gets worse. Social mobility  things we really care about  physical health  social trust  all go down as inequality goes up. Similarly  negative things in social collectives and societies  things like obesity  and violence  imprisonment  and punishment  are exacerbated as economic inequality increases. Again  these are outcomes not just experienced by a few  but that resound across all strata of society. Even people at the top experience these outcomes. So what do we do  This cascade of self perpetuating  pernicious  negative effects could seem like something that's spun out of control  and there's nothing we can do about it  certainly nothing we as individuals could do. But in fact  we've been finding in our own laboratory research that small psychological interventions  small changes to people's values  small nudges in certain directions  can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy. For instance  reminding people of the benefits of cooperation  or the advantages of community  cause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian as poor people. In one study  we had people watch a brief video  just    seconds long  about childhood poverty that served as a reminder of the needs of others in the world around them  and after watching that  we looked at how willing people were to offer up their own time to a stranger presented to them in the lab who was in distress. After watching this video  an hour later  rich people became just as generous of their own time to help out this other person  a stranger  as someone who's poor  suggesting that these differences are not innate or categorical  but are so malleable to slight changes in people's values  and little nudges of compassion and bumps of empathy. And beyond the walls of our lab  we're even beginning to see  signs of change in society. Bill Gates  one of our nation's wealthiest individuals  in his Harvard commencement speech  talked about the problem facing society of inequality as being the most daunting challenge  and talked about what must be done to combat it  saying   Humanity's greatest advances are not in its discoveries  but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity.  And there's the Giving Pledge  in which more than     of our nation's wealthiest individuals are pledging half of their fortunes to charity. And there's the emergence of dozens of grassroots movements  like We are the One Percent  the Resource Generation  or Wealth for Common Good  in which the most privileged members of the population  members of the one percent and elsewhere  people who are wealthy  are using their own economic resources  adults and youth alike  that's what's most striking to me  leveraging their own privilege  their own economic resources  to combat inequality by advocating for social policies  changes in social values  and changes in people's behavior  that work against their own economic interests but that may ultimately restore the American dream. Thank you. It's the fifth time I stand on this shore  the Cuban shore  looking out at that distant horizon  believing  again  that I'm going to make it all the way across that vast  dangerous wilderness of an ocean. Not only have I tried four times  but the greatest swimmers in the world have been trying since       and it's still never been done. The team is proud of our four attempts. It's an expedition of some    people. Bonnie is my best friend and head handler  who somehow summons will  that last drop of will within me  when I think it's gone  after many  many hours and days out there. The shark experts are the best in the world    large predators below. The box jellyfish  the deadliest venom in all of the ocean  is in these waters  and I have come close to dying from them on a previous attempt. The conditions themselves  besides the sheer distance of over     miles in the open ocean    the currents and whirling eddies and the Gulf Stream itself  the most unpredictable of all of the planet Earth. And by the way  it's amusing to me that journalists and people before these attempts often ask me   Well  are you going to go with any boats or any people or anything   And I'm thinking  what are they imagining  That I'll just sort of do some celestial navigation  and carry a bowie knife in my mouth  and I'll hunt fish and skin them alive and eat them  and maybe drag a desalinization plant behind me for fresh water. Yes  I have a team.  Laughter  And the team is expert  and the team is courageous  and brimming with innovation and scientific discovery  as is true with any major expedition on the planet. And we've been on a journey. And the debate has raged  hasn't it  since the Greeks  of isn't it what it's all about  Isn't life about the journey  not really the destination  And here we've been on this journey  and the truth is  it's been thrilling. We haven't reached that other shore  and still our sense of pride and commitment  unwavering commitment. When I turned     the dream was still alive from having tried this in my   s  and dreamed it and imagined it. The most famous body of water on the Earth today  I imagine  Cuba to Florida. And it was deep. It was deep in my soul. And when I turned     it wasn't so much about the athletic accomplishment  it wasn't the ego of  I want to be the first.  That's always there and it's undeniable. But it was deeper. It was  how much life is there left  Let's face it  we're all on a one way street  aren't we  and what are we going to do  What are we going to do as we go forward to have no regrets looking back  And all this past year in training  I had that Teddy Roosevelt quote to paraphrase it  floating around in my brain  and it says   You go ahead  you go ahead and sit back in your comfortable chair and you be the critic  you be the observer  while the brave one gets in the ring and engages and gets bloody and gets dirty and fails over and over and over again  but yet isn't afraid and isn't timid and lives life in a bold way.  And so of course I want to make it across. It is the goal  and I should be so shallow to say that this year  the destination was even sweeter than the journey. But the journey itself was worthwhile taking. And at this point  by this summer  everybody    scientists  sports scientists  endurance experts  neurologists  my own team  Bonnie    said it's impossible. It just simply can't be done  and Bonnie said to me   But if you're going to take the journey  I'm going to see you through to the end of it  so I'll be there.  And now we're there. And as we're looking out  kind of a surreal moment before the first stroke  standing on the rocks at Marina Hemingway  the Cuban flag is flying above  all my team's out in their boats  hands up in the air   We're here  we're here for you   Bonnie and I look at each other  and we say  this year  the mantra is    and I've been using it in training    find a way. You have a dream and you have obstacles in front of you  as we all do. None of us ever get through this life without heartache  without turmoil  and if you believe and you have faith and you can get knocked down and get back up again and you believe in perseverance as a great human quality  you find your way  and Bonnie grabbed my shoulders  and she said   Let's find our way to Florida.  And we started  and for the next    hours  it was an intense  unforgettable life experience. The highs were high  the awe  I'm not a religious person  but I'll tell you  to be in the azure blue of the Gulf Stream as if  as you're breathing  you're looking down miles and miles and miles  to feel the majesty of this blue planet we live on  it's awe inspiring. I have a playlist of about    songs  and especially in the middle of the night  and that night  because we use no lights    lights attract jellyfish  lights attract sharks  lights attract baitfish that attract sharks  so we go in the pitch black of the night. You've never seen black this black. You can't see the front of your hand  and the people on the boat  Bonnie and my team on the boat  they just hear the slapping of the arms  and they know where I am  because there's no visual at all. And I'm out there kind of tripping out on my little playlist. I've got a tight rubber cap  so I don't hear a thing. I've got goggles and I'm turning my head    times a minute  and I'm singing    Imagine there's no heaven     doo doo doo doo doo     It's easy if you try     doo doo doo doo doo   And I can sing that song a thousand times in a row. Now there's a talent unto itself. And each time I get done with   Ooh  you may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one      .   Imagine there's no heaven   And when I get through the end of a thousand of John Lennon's  Imagine   I have swum nine hours and    minutes  exactly. And then there are the crises. Of course there are. And the vomiting starts  the seawater  you're not well  you're wearing a jellyfish mask for the ultimate protection. It's difficult to swim in. It's causing abrasions on the inside of the mouth  but the tentacles can't get you. And the hypothermia sets in. The water's    degrees  and yet you're losing weight and using calories  and as you come over toward the side of the boat  not allowed to touch it  not allowed to get out  but Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition and asks me what I'm doing  am I all right  I am seeing the Taj Mahal over here. I'm in a very different state  and I'm thinking  wow  I never thought I'd be running into the Taj Mahal out here. It's gorgeous. I mean  how long did it take them to build that  It's just    So  uh  wooo.  Laughter  And then we kind of have a cardinal rule that I'm never told  really  how far it is  because we don't know how far it is. What's going to happen to you between this point and that point  What's going to happen to the weather and the currents and  God forbid  you're stung when you don't think you could be stung in all this armor  and Bonnie made a decision coming into that third morning that I was suffering and I was hanging on by a thread and she said   Come here   and I came close to the boat  and she said   Look  look out there   and I saw light  because the day's easier than the night  and I thought we were coming into day  and I saw a stream of white light along the horizon  and I said   It's going to be morning soon.  And she said   No  those are the lights of Key West.  It was    more hours  which for most swimmers would be a long time. You have no idea how many    hour training swims I had done. So here we go  and I somehow  without a decision  went into no counting of strokes and no singing and no quoting Stephen Hawking and the parameters of the universe  I just went into thinking about this dream  and why  and how. And as I said  when I turned     it wasn't about that concrete  Can you do it   That's the everyday machinations. That's the discipline  and it's the preparation  and there's a pride in that. But I decided to think  as I went along  about  the phrase usually is reaching for the stars  and in my case  it's reaching for the horizon. And when you reach for the horizon  as I've proven  you may not get there  but what a tremendous build of character and spirit that you lay down. What a foundation you lay down in reaching for those horizons. And now the shore is coming  and there's just a little part of me that's sad. The epic journey is going to be over. So many people come up to me now and say   What's next  We love that  That little tracker that was on the computer  When are you going to do the next one  We just can't wait to follow the next one.  Well  they were just there for    hours  and I was there for years. And so there won't be another epic journey in the ocean. But the point is  and the point was that every day of our lives is epic  and I'll tell you  when I walked up onto that beach  staggered up onto that beach  and I had so many times in a very puffed up ego way  rehearsed what I would say on the beach. When Bonnie thought that the back of my throat was swelling up  and she brought the medical team over to our boat to say that she's really beginning to have trouble breathing. Another        hours in the saltwater  the whole thing    and I just thought in my hallucinatory moment  that I heard the word tracheotomy. And Bonnie said to the doctor   I'm not worried about her not breathing. If she can't talk when she gets to the shore  she's gonna be pissed off.  But the truth is  all those orations that I had practiced just to get myself through some training swims as motivation  it wasn't like that. It was a very real moment  with that crowd  with my team. We did it. I didn't do it. We did it. And we'll never forget it. It'll always be part of us. And the three things that I did sort of blurt out when we got there  was first   Never  ever give up.  I live it. What's the phrase from today from Socrates  To be is to do. So I don't stand up and say  don't ever give up. I didn't give up  and there was action behind these words. The second is   You can chase your dreams at any age  you're never too old.  Sixty four  that no one at any age  any gender  could ever do  has done it  and there's no doubt in my mind that I am at the prime of my life today. Yeah. Thank you. And the third thing I said on that beach was   It looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world  and in many ways  of course  it is  and in other ways  and the most important ways  it's a team  and if you think I'm a badass  you want to meet Bonnie.  Bonnie  where are you  Where are you  There's Bonnie Stoll.  Applause  My buddy. The Henry David Thoreau quote goes  when you achieve your dreams  it's not so much what you get as who you have become in achieving them. And yeah  I stand before you now. In the three months since that swim ended  I've sat down with Oprah and I've been in President Obama's Oval Office. I've been invited to speak in front of esteemed groups such as yourselves. I've signed a wonderful major book contract. All of that's great  and I don't denigrate it. I'm proud of it all  but the truth is  I'm walking around tall because I am that bold  fearless person  and I will be  every day  until it's time for these days to be done. Thank you very much and enjoy the conference. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Find a way   Applause  How many of you have been to Oklahoma City  Raise your hand. Yeah  How many of you have not been to Oklahoma City and have no idea who I am   Laughter  Most of you. Let me give you a little bit of background. Oklahoma City started in the most unique way imaginable. Back on a spring day in       the federal government held what they called a land run. They literally lined up the settlers along an imaginary line  and they fired off a gun  and the settlers roared across the countryside and put down a stake  and wherever they put down that stake  that was their new home. And at the end of the very first day  the population of Oklahoma City had gone from zero to         and our planning department is still paying for that. The citizens got together on that first day and elected a mayor. And then they shot him. That's not really all that funny     Laughter     but it allows me to see what type of audience I'm dealing with  so I appreciate the feedback. The   th century was fairly kind to Oklahoma City. Our economy was based on commodities  so the price of cotton or the price of wheat  and ultimately the price of oil and natural gas. And along the way  we became a city of innovation. The shopping cart was invented in Oklahoma City. The parking meter  invented in Oklahoma City. You're welcome. Having an economy  though  that relates to commodities can give you some ups and some downs  and that was certainly the case in Oklahoma City's history. In the     s  when it appeared that the price of energy would never retreat  our economy was soaring  and then in the early     s  it cratered quickly. The price of energy dropped. Our banks began to fail. Before the end of the decade      banks had failed in the state of Oklahoma. There was no bailout on the horizon. Our banking industry  our oil and gas industry  our commercial real estate industry  were all at the bottom of the economic scale. Young people were leaving Oklahoma City in droves for Washington and Dallas and Houston and New York and Tokyo  anywhere where they could  find a job that measured up to their educational attainment  because in Oklahoma City  the good jobs just weren't there. But along at the end of the '  s came an enterprising businessman who became mayor named Ron Norick. Ron Norick eventually figured out that the secret to economic development wasn't incentivizing companies up front  it was about creating a place where businesses wanted to locate  and so he pushed an initiative called MAPS that basically was a penny on the dollar sales tax to build a bunch of stuff. It built a new sports arena  a new canal downtown  it fixed up our performing arts center  a new baseball stadium downtown  a lot of things to improve the quality of life. And the economy indeed seemed to start showing some signs of life. The next mayor came along. He started MAPS for Kids  rebuilt the entire inner city school system  all    buildings either built anew or refurbished. And then  in       in this rare collective lack of judgment bordering on civil disobedience  the citizens elected me mayor. Now the city I inherited was just on the verge of coming out of its slumbering economy  and for the very first time  we started showing up on the lists. Now you know the lists I'm talking about. The media and the Internet love to rank cities. And in Oklahoma City  we'd never really been on lists before. So I thought it was kind of cool when they came out with these positive lists and we were on there. We weren't anywhere close to the top  but we were on the list  we were somebody. Best city to get a job  best city to start a business  best downtown    Oklahoma City. And then came the list of the most obese cities in the country. And there we were. Now I like to point out that we were on that list with a lot of really cool places. Dallas and Houston and New Orleans and Atlanta and Miami. You know  these are cities that  typically  you're not embarrassed to be associated with. But nonetheless  I didn't like being on the list. And about that time  I got on the scales. And I weighed     pounds. And then I went to this website sponsored by the federal government  and I typed in my height  I typed in my weight  and I pushed Enter  and it came back and said  obese.  I thought   What a stupid website.   I'm not obese. I would know if I was obese.  And then I started getting honest with myself about what had become my lifelong struggle with obesity  and I noticed this pattern  that I was gaining about two or three pounds a year  and then about every    years  I'd drop    or    pounds. And then I'd do it again. And I had this huge closet full of clothes  and I could only wear a third of it at any one time  and only I knew which part of the closet I could wear. But it all seemed fairly normal  going through it. Well  I finally decided I needed to lose weight  and I knew I could because I'd done it so many times before  so I simply stopped eating as much. I had always exercised. That really wasn't the part of the equation that I needed to work on. But I had been eating       calories a day  and I cut it to       calories a day  and the weight came off. I lost about a pound a week for about    weeks. Along the way  though  I started examining my city  its culture  its infrastructure  trying to figure out why our specific city seemed to have a problem with obesity. And I came to the conclusion that we had built an incredible quality of life if you happen to be a car. But if you happen to be a person  you are combatting the car seemingly at every turn. Our city is very spread out. We have a great intersection of highways  I mean  literally no traffic congestion in Oklahoma City to speak of. And so people live far  far away. Our city limits are enormous      square miles  but    miles is less than    minutes. You literally can get a speeding ticket during rush hour in Oklahoma City. And as a result  people tend to spread out. Land's cheap. We had also not required developers to build sidewalks on new developments  for a long  long time. We had fixed that  but it had been relatively recently  and there were literally         or more homes into our inventory in neighborhoods that had  virtually no level of walkability. And as I tried to examine how we might deal with obesity  and was taking all of these elements into my mind  I decided that the first thing we need to do was have a conversation. You see  in Oklahoma City  we weren't talking about obesity. And so  on New Year's Eve of       I went to the zoo  and I stood in front of the elephants  and I said   This city is going on a diet  and we're going to lose a million pounds.  Well  that's when all hell broke loose. The national media gravitated toward this story immediately  and they really could have  gone with it one of two ways. They could have said   This city is so fat that the mayor had to put them on a diet.  But fortunately  the consensus was   Look  this is a problem in a lot of places. This is a city that's wanting to do something about it.  And so they started helping us drive traffic to the website. Now  the web address was thiscityisgoingonadiet.com. And I appeared on  The Ellen DeGeneres Show  one weekday morning to talk about the initiative  and on that day          visits were placed to our website. People were signing up  and so the pounds started to add up  and the conversation that I thought was so important to have was starting to take place. It was taking place inside the homes  mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids. It was taking place in churches. Churches were starting their own running groups and their own support groups for people who were dealing with obesity. Suddenly  it was a topic worth discussing at schools and in the workplace. And the large companies  they typically have wonderful wellness programs  but the medium sized companies that typically fall between the cracks on issues like this  they started to get engaged and used our program as a model for their own employees to try and have contests to see who might be able to deal with their obesity situation in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others. And then came the next stage of the equation. It was time to push what I called MAPS  . Now MAPS    like the other two programs  had had an economic development motive behind it  but along with the traditional economic development tasks like building a new convention center  we added some health related infrastructure to the process. We added a new central park     acres in size  to be right downtown in Oklahoma City. We're building a downtown streetcar to try and help the walkability formula for people who choose to live in the inner city and help us create the density there. We're building senior health and wellness centers throughout the community. We put some investments on the river that had originally been invested upon in the original MAPS  and now we are currently in the final stages of developing the finest venue in the world for the sports of canoe  kayak and rowing. We hosted the Olympic trials last spring. We have Olympic caliber events coming to Oklahoma City  and athletes from all over the world moving in  along with inner city programs to get kids more engaged in these types of recreational activities that are a little bit nontraditional. We also  with another initiative that was passed  are building hundreds of miles of new sidewalks throughout the metro area. We're even going back into some inner city situations where we had built neighborhoods and we had built schools but we had not connected the two. We had built libraries and we had built neighborhoods  but we had never really connected the two with any sort of walkability. Through yet another funding source  we're redesigning all of our inner city streets to be more pedestrian friendly. Our streets were really wide  and you'd push the button to allow you to walk across  and you had to run in order to get there in time. But now we've narrowed the streets  highly landscaped them  making them more pedestrian friendly  really a redesign  rethinking the way we build our infrastructure  designing a city around people and not cars. We're completing our bicycle trail master plan. We'll have over     miles when we're through building it out. And so you see this culture starting to shift in Oklahoma City. And lo and behold  the demographic changes that are coming with it are very inspiring. Highly educated twentysomethings are moving to Oklahoma City from all over the region and  indeed  even from further away  in California. When we reached a million pounds  in January of       I flew to New York with some our participants who had lost over     pounds  whose lives had been changed  and we appeared on the Rachael Ray show  and then that afternoon  I did a round of media in New York pushing the same messages that you're accustomed to hearing about obesity and the dangers of it. And I went into the lobby of Men's Fitness magazine  the same magazine that had put us on that list five years before. And as I'm sitting in the lobby waiting to talk to the reporter  I notice there's a magazine copy of the current issue right there on the table  and I pick it up  and I look at the headline across the top  and it says   America's Fattest Cities  Do You Live in One   Well  I knew I did  so I picked up the magazine and I began to look  and we weren't on it. Then I looked on the list of fittest cities  and we were on that list. We were on the list as the   nd fittest city in the United States. Our state health statistics are doing better. Granted  we have a long way to go. Health is still not something that we should be proud of in Oklahoma City  but we seem to have turned the cultural shift of making health a greater priority. And we love the idea of the demographics of highly educated twentysomethings  people with choices  choosing Oklahoma City in large numbers. We have the lowest unemployment in the United States  probably the strongest economy in the United States. And if you're like me  at some point in your educational career  you were asked to read a book called  The Grapes of Wrath.  Oklahomans leaving for California in large numbers for a better future. When we look at the demographic shifts of people coming from the west  it appears that what we're seeing now is the wrath of grapes. The grandchildren are coming home. You've been a great audience and very attentive. Thank you very much for having me here. Hello  TEDWomen  what's up. Not good enough. Hello  TEDWomen  what is up  My name is Maysoon Zayid  and I am not drunk  but the doctor who delivered me was. He cut my mom six different times in six different directions  suffocating poor little me in the process. As a result  I have cerebral palsy  which means I shake all the time. Look. It's exhausting. I'm like Shakira  Shakira meets Muhammad Ali. CP is not genetic. It's not a birth defect. You can't catch it. No one put a curse on my mother's uterus  and I didn't get it because my parents are first cousins  which they are. It only happens from accidents  like what happened to me on my birth day. Now  I must warn you  I'm not inspirational. And I don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me  because at some point in your life  you have dreamt of being disabled. Come on a journey with me. It's Christmas Eve  you're at the mall  you're driving around in circles looking for parking  and what do you see  Sixteen empty handicapped spaces. And you're like   God  can't I just be a little disabled   Also  I've got to tell you  I've got    problems  and palsy is just one. If there was an Oppression Olympics  I would win the gold medal. I'm Palestinian  Muslim  I'm female  I'm disabled  and I live in New Jersey. If you don't feel better about yourself  maybe you should. Cliffside Park  New Jersey is my hometown. I have always loved the fact that my hood and my affliction share the same initials. I also love the fact that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City  I could. A lot of people with CP don't walk  but my parents didn't believe in  can't.  My father's mantra was   You can do it  yes you can can.  So  if my three older sisters were mopping  I was mopping. If my three older sisters went to public school  my parents would sue the school system and guarantee that I went too  and if we didn't all get A's  we all got my mother's slipper. My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking. Another tactic that he used is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it. My inner stripper was very strong. Yeah. No  by the first day of kindergarten  I was walking like a champ who had been punched one too many times. Growing up  there were only six Arabs in my town  and they were all my family. Now there are    Arabs in town  and they are still all my family. I don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian. This was before      and before politicians thought it was appropriate to use  I hate Muslims  as a campaign slogan. The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith. They did  however  seem very concerned that I would starve to death during Ramadan. I would explain to them that I have enough fat to live off of for three whole months  so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake. I have tap danced on Broadway. Yeah  on Broadway. It's crazy. My parents couldn't afford physical therapy  so they sent me to dancing school. I learned how to dance in heels  which means I can walk in heels. And I'm from Jersey  and we are really concerned with being chic  so if my friends wore heels  so did I. And when my friends went and spent their summer vacations on the Jersey Shore  I did not. I spent my summers in a war zone  because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine every single summer  we'd grow up to be Madonna. Summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me  so I drank deer's milk  I had hot cups on my back  I was dunked in the Dead Sea  and I remember the water burning my eyes and thinking   It's working  It's working   But one miracle cure we did find was yoga. I have to tell you  it's very boring  but before I did yoga  I was a stand up comedian who can't stand up. And now I can stand on my head. My parents reinforced this notion that I could do anything  that no dream was impossible  and my dream was to be on the daytime soap opera  General Hospital.  I went to college during affirmative action and got a sweet scholarship to ASU  Arizona State University  because I fit every single quota. I was like the pet lemur of the theater department. Everybody loved me. I did all the less than intelligent kids' homework  I got A's in all of my classes  A's in all of their classes. Every time I did a scene from  The Glass Menagerie   my professors would weep. But I never got cast. Finally  my senior year  ASU decided to do a show called  They Dance Real Slow in Jackson.  It's a play about a girl with CP. I was a girl with CP. So I start shouting from the rooftops   I'm finally going to get a part  I have cerebral palsy  Free at last  Free at last  Thank God almighty  I'm free at last   I didn't get the part. Sherry Brown got the part. I went racing to the head of the theater department crying hysterically  like someone shot my cat  to ask her why  and she said it was because they didn't think I could do the stunts. I said   Excuse me  if I can't do the stunts  neither can the character.  This was a part that I was literally born to play they gave it to a non palsy actress. College was imitating life. Hollywood has a sordid history of casting able bodied actors to play disabled onscreen. Upon graduating  I moved back home  and my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera. My dream was coming true. And I knew that I would be promoted from  Diner Diner  to  Wacky Best Friend  in no time. But instead  I remained a glorified piece of furniture that you could only recognize from the back of my head  and it became clear to me that casting directors didn't hire fluffy  ethnic  disabled actors. They only hired perfect people. But there were exceptions to the rule. I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg  Roseanne Barr  Ellen  and all of these women had one thing in common  they were comedians. So I became a comic. My first gig was driving famous comics from New York City to shows in New Jersey  and I'll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove when he realized that he was speeding down the New Jersey Turnpike with a chick with CP driving him. I've performed in clubs all over America  and I've also performed in Arabic in the Middle East  uncensored and uncovered. Some people say I'm the first stand up comic in the Arab world. I never like to claim first  but I do know that they never heard that nasty little rumor that women aren't funny  and they find us hysterical. In       my brother from another mother and father Dean Obeidallah and I started the New York Arab American Comedy Festival  now in its   th year. Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab Americans in media  while also reminding casting directors that South Asian and Arab are not synonymous. Mainstreaming Arabs was much  much easier than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability. My big break came in     . I was invited to be a guest on the cable news show  Countdown with Keith Olbermann.  I walked in looking like I was going to the prom  and they shuffle me into a studio and seat me on a spinning  rolling chair. So I looked at the stage manager and I'm like   Excuse me  can I have another chair   And she looked at me and she went   Five  four  three  two ...  And we were live  right  So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk so that I wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment  and when the interview was over  I was livid. I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it  and I knew I would never get invited back. But not only did Mr. Olbermann invite me back  he made me a full time contributor  and he taped down my chair. One fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Olbermann was that humans on the Internet are scumbags. People say children are cruel  but I was never made fun of as a child or an adult. Suddenly  my disability on the world wide web is fair game. I would look at clips online and see comments like   Yo  why's she tweakin'    Yo  is she retarded   And my favorite   Poor Gumby mouth terrorist. What does she suffer from  We should really pray for her.  One commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits  screenwriter  comedian  palsy. Disability is as visual as race. If a wheelchair user can't play Beyonc   then Beyonc  can't play a wheelchair user. The disabled are the largest   Yeah  clap for that  man. Come on. People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world  and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment. The doctors said that I wouldn't walk  but I am here in front of you. However  if I grew up with social media  I don't think I would be. I hope that together  we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life. Perhaps if there were more positive images  it would foster less hate on the Internet. Or maybe not. Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well. My crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places. I got to walk the red carpet flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci and the iconic Loreen Arbus. I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler and work with my idol  the amazing Dave Matthews. I toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild. I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey at the      DNC. And I founded Maysoon's Kids  a charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children a sliver of the chance my parents gave me. But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got    before this moment    But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got to perform for the man who floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee  has Parkinson's and shakes just like me  Muhammad Ali. It was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live  and I dedicate this talk to his memory. and if I can can  you can can. Good morning  Are you awake  They took my name tag  but I wanted to ask you  did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic  Anyone  No one  All right  no problem. Once upon a time  not long ago  I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend  ordering food. So I looked at the waiter and said   Do you have a menu  Arabic    He looked at me strangely  thinking that he misheard. He said   Sorry   English .  I said   The menu  Arabic   please.  He replied   Don't you know what they call it    I do.  He said   No  It's called  menu   English   or  menu   French .  Is the French pronunciation correct   Come  come  take care of this one   said the waiter. He was disgusted when talking to me  as if he was saying to himself   If this was the last girl on Earth  I wouldn't look at her   What's the meaning of saying  menu  in Arabic  Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant. How could she speak that way  At that moment  I started thinking. It made me mad. It definitely hurts  I'm denied the right to speak my own language in my own country  Where could this happen  How did we get here  Well  while we are here  there are many people like me  who would reach a stage in their lives  where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past  just so they can say that they're modern and civilized. Should I forget all my culture  thoughts  intellect and all my memories  Childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war  Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic  just to conform  To be one of them  Where's the logic in that  Despite all that  I tried to understand him. I didn't want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me. The Arabic language doesn't satisfy today's needs. It's not a language for science  research  a language we're used to in universities  a language we use in the workplace  a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project  and it definitely isn't a language we use at the airport. If we did so  they'd strip us of our clothes. Where can I use it  then  We could all ask this question  So  you want us to use Arabic. Where are we to do so  This is one reality. But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about. Arabic is the mother tongue. Research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue. Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages. How  Gibran Khalil Gibran  when he first started writing  he used Arabic. All his ideas  imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up  smelling a specific smell  hearing a specific voice  and thinking a specific thought. So  when he started writing in English  he had enough baggage. Even when he wrote in English  when you read his writings in English  you smell the same smell  sense the same feeling. You can imagine that that's him writing in English  the same boy who came from the mountain. From a village on Mount Lebanon. So  this is an example no one can argue with. Second  it's often said that if you want to kill a nation  the only way to kill a nation  is to kill its language. This is a reality that developed societies are aware of. The Germans  French  Japanese and Chinese  all these nations are aware of this. That's why they legislate to protect their language. They make it sacred. That's why they use it in production  they pay a lot of money to develop it. Do we know better than them  All right  we aren't from the developed world  this advanced thinking hasn't reached us yet  and we would like to catch up with the civilized world. Countries that were once like us  but decided to strive for development  do research  and catch up with those countries  such as Turkey  Malaysia and others  they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder  protected it like a diamond. They kept it close to them. Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it's not labeled in Turkish  then it isn't a local product. You wouldn't believe it's a local product. They'd go back to being consumers  clueless consumers  like we are most of the time. So  in order for them to innovate and produce  they had to protect their language. If I say   Freedom  sovereignty  independence  Arabic    what does this remind you of  It doesn't ring a bell  does it  Regardless of the who  how and why. Language isn't just for conversing  just words coming out of our mouths. Language represents specific stages in our lives  and terminology that is linked to our emotions. So when we say   Freedom  sovereignty  independence   each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind  there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period. Language isn't one  two or three words or letters put together. It's an idea inside that relates to how we think  and how we see each other and how others see us. What is our intellect  How do you say whether this guy understands or not  So  if I say   Freedom  sovereignty  independence  English    or if your son came up to you and said   Dad  have you lived through the period of the freedom  English  slogan   How would you feel  If you don't see a problem  then I'd better leave  and stop talking in vain. The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing. I have a francophone friend who's married to a French man. I asked her once how things were going. She said   Everything is fine  but once  I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word 'toqborni' for him.  The poor woman had mistakenly told him  toqborni   and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him. He was puzzled by the thought   How could anyone be this cruel  Does she want to commit suicide  'Bury me '  English   This is one of the few examples. It made us feel that she's unable to tell that word to her husband  since he won't understand  and he's right not to  his way of thinking is different. She said to me   He listens to Fairuz with me  and one night  I tried to translate for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz.  The poor woman tried to translate this for him   From them I extended my hands and stole you     And here's the pickle   And because you belong to them  I returned my hands and left you.  Translate that for me. So  what have we done to protect the Arabic language  We turned this into a concern of the civil society  and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language. Even though many people told me   Why do you bother  Forget about this headache and go have fun.  No problem  The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says   I talk to you from the East  but you reply from the West.  We didn't say   No  We do not accept this or that.  We didn't adopt this style because that way  we wouldn't be understood. And when someone talks to me that way  I hate the Arabic language. We say   We want to change our reality  and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams  aspirations and day to day life. In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do. So   I talk to you from the East  but you reply from the West  has hit the spot. Something very easy  yet creative and persuasive. After that  we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground. You've seen an example of it outside  a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with  Don't kill your language   written on it. Why  Seriously  don't kill your language. We really shouldn't kill our language. If we were to kill the language  we'd have to find an identity. We'd have to find an existence. We'd go back to the beginning. This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized. After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter. Photos of  cool  guys and girls. We are very cool  And to whoever might say   Ha  You used an English word   I say   No  I adopt the word 'cool.'  Let them object however they want  but give me a word that's nicer and matches the reality better. I will keep on saying  Internet  I wouldn't say   I'm going to the world wide web  Because it doesn't fit  We shouldn't kid ourselves. But to reach this point  we all have to be convinced that we shouldn't allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language  to control us or make us think and feel what they want. Creativity is the idea. So  if we can't reach space or build a rocket and so on  we can be creative. At this moment  every one of you is a creative project. Creativity in your mother tongue is the path. Let's start from this moment. Let's write a novel or produce a short film. A single novel could make us global again. It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one. So  it's not true that there's no solution  there is a solution  But we have to know that  and be convinced that a solution exists  that we have a duty to be part of that solution. In conclusion  what can you do today  Now  tweets  who's tweeting  Please  I beg of you  even though my time has finished  either Arabic  English  French or Chinese. But don't write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers  It's a disaster  That's not a language. You'd be entering a virtual world with a virtual language. It's not easy to come back from such a place and rise. That's the first thing we can do. Second  there are many other things that we can do. We're not here today to convince each other. We're here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language. Now I will tell you a secret. A baby first identifies its father through language. When my daughter is born  I'll tell her   This is your father  honey  Arabic .  I wouldn't say   This is your dad  honey  English .  And in the supermarket  I promise my daughter Noor  that if she says to me   Thanks  Arabic    I won't say   Dis  'Merci  Maman '  and hope no one has heard her. Let's get rid of this cultural cringe. So this is a picture of my dad and me at the beach in Far Rockaway  or actually Rockaway Park. I'm the one with the blond hair. My dad's the guy with the cigarette. It was the '  s. A lot of people smoked back then. In the summer of       my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer. Cancer is one of those things that actually touches everybody. If you're a man in the United States of the America  you've got about a one in two chance of being diagnosed with cancer during your lifetime. If you're a woman  you've got about a one in three chance of being diagnosed with cancer. Everybody knows somebody who's been diagnosed with cancer. Now  my dad's doing better today  and part of the reason for that is that he was able to participate in the trial of an experimental new drug that happened to be specially formulated and very good for his particular kind of cancer. There are over     kinds of cancer. And what I want to talk about today is how we can help more people like my dad  because we have to change the way we think about raising money to fund cancer research. So a while after my dad was diagnosed  I was having coffee with my friend Andrew Lo. He's the head of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at MIT  where I also have a position  and we were talking about cancer. And Andrew had been doing his own bits of research  and one of the things that he had been told and that he'd learned from studying the literature was that there's actually a big bottleneck. It's very difficult to develop new drugs  and the reason it's difficult to develop new drugs is because in the early stages of drug development  the drugs are very risky  and they're very expensive. So Andrew asked me if I'd want to maybe work with him a bit  work on some of the math and the analytics and see if we could figure out something we could do. Now I'm not a scientist. You know  I don't know how to build a drug. And none of my coauthors  Andrew Lo or Jose Maria Fernandez or David Fagnan    none of those guys    are scientists either. We don't know the first thing about how to make a cancer drug. But we know a little bit about risk mitigation and a little bit about financial engineering  and so we started thinking  what could we do  What I'm going to tell you about is some work we've been doing over the last couple years that we think could fundamentally change the way research for cancer and lots of other things gets done. We want to let the research drive the funding  not the other way around. So in order to get started  let me tell you how you get a drug financed. Imagine that you're in your lab    you're a scientist  you're not like me    you're a scientist  and you've developed a new compound that you think might be therapeutic for somebody with cancer. Well  what you do is  you test in animals  you test in test tubes  but there's this notion of going from the bench to the bedside  and in order to get from the bench  the lab  to the bedside  to the patients  you've got to get the drug tested. And the way the drug gets tested is through a series of  basically  experiments  through these large  they're called trials  that they do to determine whether the drug is safe and whether it works and all these things. So the FDA has a very specific protocol. In the first phase of this testing  which is called testing for toxicity  it's called Phase I. In the first phase  you give the drug to healthy people and you see if it actually makes them sick. In other words  are the side effects just so severe that no matter how much good it does  it's not going to be worth it  Does it cause heart attacks  kill people  liver failure  this kind of thing  And it turns out  that's a pretty high hurdle. About a third of all drugs drop out at that point. In the next phase  you test to see if the drug's effective  and what you do there is you give it to people with cancer and you see if it actually makes them better. And that's also a higher hurdle. People drop out. And in the third phase  you actually test it on a very large sample  and what you're trying to determine is what the right dose is  and also  is it better than what's available today  If not  then why build it  When you're done with all that  what you have is a very small percentage of drugs that start the process actually come out the other side. So those blue bottles  those blue bottles save lives  and they're also worth billions  sometimes billions a year. So now here's a question  if I were to ask you  for example  to make a one time investment of  say      million dollars to buy one of those bottles  so     million dollars up front  one time  to buy one of those bottles  I won't tell you which one it is  and in    years  I'll tell you whether you have one of the blue ones. Does that sound like a good deal for anybody  No. No  right  And of course  it's a very  very risky trial position  and that's why it's very hard to get funding  but to a first approximation  that's actually the proposal. You have to fund these things from the early stages on. It takes a long time. So Andrew said to me  he said   What if we stop thinking about these as drugs  What if we start thinking about them as financial assets   They've got really weird payoff structures and all that  but let's throw everything we know about financial engineering at them. Let's see if we can use all the tricks of the trade to figure out how to make these drugs work as financial assets  Let's create a giant fund. In finance  we know what to do with assets that are risky. You put them in a portfolio and you try to smooth out the returns. So we did some math  and it turned out you could make this work  but in order to make it work  you need about    to     drugs. Now the good news is  there's plenty of drugs that are waiting to be tested. We've been told that there's a backlog of about    years of drugs that are waiting to be tested but can't be funded. In fact  that early stage of the funding process  that Phase I and pre clinical stuff  that's actually  in the industry   called the Valley of Death because it's where drugs go to die. It's very hard to for them to get through there  and of course  if you can't get through there  you can't get to the later stages. So we did this math  and we figured out  okay  well  you know  you need about    to  say       or something like that  drugs. And then we did a little more math  and we said  okay  well that's a fund of about three to    billion dollars. So we kind of created a new problem by solving the old one. We were able to get rid of the risk  but now we need a lot of capital  and there's only one place to get that kind of capital  the capital markets. Venture capitalists don't have it. Philanthropies don't have it. But we have to figure out how we can get people in the capital markets  who traditionally don't invest in this stuff  to want to invest in this stuff. So again  financial engineering was helpful here. Imagine the megafund actually starts empty  and what it does is it issues some debt and some equity  and that generates cash flow. That cash flow is used  then  to buy that big portfolio of drugs that you need  and those drugs start working their way through that approval process  and each time they go through a next phase of approval  they gain value. And most of them don't make it  but a few of them do  and with the ones that gain value  you can sell some  and when you sell them  you have money to pay the interest on those bonds  but you also have money to fund the next round of trials. It's almost self funding. You do that for the course of the transaction  and when you're done  you liquidate the portfolio  pay back the bonds  and you can give the equity holders a nice return. So that was the theory  and we talked about it for a bit  we did a bunch of experiments  and then we said  let's really try to test it. We spent the next two years doing research. We talked to hundreds of experts in drug financing and venture capital. We talked to people who have developed drugs. We talked to pharmaceutical companies. We actually looked at the data for drugs  over       drugs that had been approved or denied or withdrawn  and we also ran millions of simulations. And all that actually took a lot of time. But when we were done  what we found was something that was sort of surprising. It was actually feasible to structure that fund such that when you were done structuring it  you could actually produce low risk bonds that would be attractive to bond holders  that would give you yields of about five to eight percent  and you could produce equity that would give equity holders about a    percent return. Now those returns aren't going to be attractive to a venture capitalist. Venture capitalists are those guys who want to make those big bets and get those billion dollar payoffs. But it turns out  there are lots of other folks that would be interested in that. That's right in the investment sweet spot of pension funds and     k  plans and all this other stuff. So we published some articles in the academic press. We published articles in medical journals. We published articles in finance journals. But it wasn't until we actually got the popular press interested in this that we began to get some traction. We wanted to do something more than just make people aware of it  though. We wanted people to get involved. So what we did was  we actually took all of our computer code and made that available online under an open source license to anybody that wanted it. And you guys can download it today if you want to run your own experiments to see if this would work. And that was really effective  because people that didn't believe our assumptions could try their own assumptions and see how it would work. Now there's an obvious problem  which is  is there enough money in the world to fund this stuff  I've told you there's enough drugs  but is there enough money  There's     trillion dollars of capital currently invested in fixed income securities. That's a hundred thousand billion. There's plenty of money. But what we realized was that it's more than just money that's required. We had to get people motivated  people to get involved  and people had to understand this. And so we started thinking about all  the different things that could go wrong. What are all the challenges to doing  this that might get in the way  And we had a long list  and so what we did was we assigned a bunch of people  including ourselves  different pieces of this problem  and we said  could you start a work stream on credit risk  Could you start a work stream on the regulatory aspects  Could you start a work stream on how you would actually manage so many projects  And we had all these experts get together and do these different work streams  and then we held a conference. The conference was held over the summer  this past summer. It was an invitation only conference. It was sponsored by the American Cancer Society and done in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute. And we had experts from every field that we thought would be important  including the government  including people that run research centers and so on  and for two days they sat around and heard the reports from those five work streams  and they talked about it. It was the first time that the people who could actually make this happen sat across the table from each other and had these conversations. Now these conferences  it's typical to have a dinner  and at that dinner  you kind of get to know each other  sort of like what we're doing here. I happened to look out the window  and hand on my heart  I looked out the window on the night of this conference    it was the summertime    and that's what I saw  it was a double rainbow. So I'd like to think it was a good sign. Since the conference  we've got people working between Paris and San Francisco  lots of different folks working on this to try to see if we can really make it happen. We're not looking to start a fund  but we want somebody else to do this. Because  again  I'm not a scientist. I can't build a drug. I'm never going to have enough money to fund even one of those trials. But all of us together  with our     k 's  with our     plans  with our pension plans  all of us together can actually fund hundreds of trials and get paid well for doing it and save millions of lives like my dad. Thank you. Three and a half years ago  I made one of the best decisions of my life. As my New Year's resolution  I gave up dieting  stopped worrying about my weight  and learned to eat mindfully. Now I eat whenever I'm hungry  and I've lost    pounds. This was me at age     when I started my first diet. I look at that picture now  and I think  you did not need a diet  you needed a fashion consult. But I thought I needed to lose weight  and when I gained it back  of course I blamed myself. And for the next three decades  I was on and off various diets. No matter what I tried  the weight I'd lost always came back. I'm sure many of you know the feeling. As a neuroscientist  I wondered  why is this so hard  Obviously  how much you weigh depends on how much you eat and how much energy you burn. What most people don't realize is that hunger and energy use are controlled by the brain  mostly without your awareness. Your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes  and that is a good thing  because your conscious mind    how do we put this politely     it's easily distracted. It's good that you don't have to remember to breathe when you get caught up in a movie. You don't forget how to walk because you're thinking about what to have for dinner. Your brain also has its own sense of what you should weigh  no matter what you consciously believe. This is called your set point  but that's a misleading term  because it's actually a range of about    or    pounds. You can use lifestyle choices to move your weight up and down within that range  but it's much  much harder to stay outside of it. The hypothalamus  the part of the brain that regulates body weight  there are more than a dozen chemical signals in the brain that tell your body to gain weight  more than another dozen that tell your body to lose it  and the system works like a thermostat  responding to signals from the body by adjusting hunger  activity and metabolism  to keep your weight stable as conditions change. That's what a thermostat does  right  It keeps the temperature in your house the same as the weather changes outside. Now you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter  but that's not going to change the setting on the thermostat  which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up. Your brain works exactly the same way  responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal. If you lose a lot of weight  your brain reacts as if you were starving  and whether you started out fat or thin  your brain's response is exactly the same. We would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to lose weight or not  but it can't. If you do lose a lot of weight  you become hungry  and your muscles burn less energy. Dr. Rudy Leibel of Columbia University has found that people who have lost    percent of their body weight burn     to     calories less because their metabolism is suppressed. That's a lot of food. This means that a successful dieter must eat this much less forever than someone of the same weight who has always been thin. From an evolutionary perspective  your body's resistance to weight loss makes sense. When food was scarce  our ancestors' survival depended on conserving energy  and regaining the weight when food was available would have protected them against the next shortage. Over the course of human history  starvation has been a much bigger problem than overeating. This may explain a very sad fact  Set points can go up  but they rarely go down. Now  if your mother ever mentioned that life is not fair  this is the kind of thing she was talking about. Successful dieting doesn't lower your set point. Even after you've kept the weight off for as long as seven years  your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back. If that weight loss had been due to a long famine  that would be a sensible response. In our modern world of drive thru burgers  it's not working out so well for many of us. That difference between our ancestral past and our abundant present is the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff of the University of Ottawa would like to take some of his patients back to a time when food was less available  and it's also the reason that changing the food environment is really going to be the most effective solution to obesity. Sadly  a temporary weight gain can become permanent. If you stay at a high weight for too long  probably a matter of years for most of us  your brain may decide that that's the new normal. Psychologists classify eaters into two groups  those who rely on their hunger and those who try to control their eating through willpower  like most dieters. Let's call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters. The interesting thing is that intuitive eaters are less likely to be overweight  and they spend less time thinking about food. Controlled eaters are more vulnerable to overeating in response to advertising  super sizing  and the all you can eat buffet. And a small indulgence  like eating one scoop of ice cream  is more likely to lead to a food binge in controlled eaters. Children are especially vulnerable to this cycle of dieting and then binging. Several long term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early teenage years are three times more likely to become overweight five years later  even if they started at a normal weight  and all of these studies found that the same factors that predicted weight gain also predicted the development of eating disorders. The other factor  by the way  those of you who are parents  was being teased by family members about their weight. So don't do that. I left almost all my graphs at home  but I couldn't resist throwing in just this one  because I'm a geek  and that's how I roll. This is a study that looked at the risk of death over a    year period based on four healthy habits  eating enough fruits and vegetables  exercise three times a week  not smoking  and drinking in moderation. Let's start by looking at the normal weight people in the study. The height of the bars is the risk of death  and those zero  one  two  three  four numbers on the horizontal axis are the number of those healthy habits that a given person had. And as you'd expect  the healthier the lifestyle  the less likely people were to die during the study. Now let's look at what happens in overweight people. The ones that had no healthy habits had a higher risk of death. Adding just one healthy habit pulls overweight people back into the normal range. For obese people with no healthy habits  the risk is very high  seven times higher than the healthiest groups in the study. But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too. In fact  if you look only at the group with all four healthy habits  you can see that weight makes very little difference. You can take control of your health by taking control of your lifestyle  even If you can't lose weight and keep it off. Diets don't have very much reliability. Five years after a diet  most people have regained the weight. Forty percent of them have gained even more. If you think about this  the typical outcome of dieting is that you're more likely to gain weight in the long run than to lose it. If I've convinced you that dieting might be a problem  the next question is  what do you do about it  And my answer  in a word  is mindfulness. I'm not saying you need to learn to meditate or take up yoga. I'm talking about mindful eating  learning to understand your body's signals so that you eat when you're hungry and stop when you're full  because a lot of weight gain boils down to eating when you're not hungry. How do you do it  Give yourself permission to eat as much as you want  and then work on figuring out what makes your body feel good. Sit down to regular meals without distractions. Think about how your body feels when you start to eat and when you stop  and let your hunger decide when you should be done. It took about a year for me to learn this  but it's really been worth it. I am so much more relaxed around food than I have ever been in my life. I often don't think about it. I forget we have chocolate in the house. It's like aliens have taken over my brain. It's just completely different. I should say that this approach to eating probably won't make you lose weight unless you often eat when you're not hungry  but doctors don't know of any approach that makes significant weight loss in a lot of people  and that is why a lot of people are now focusing on preventing weight gain instead of promoting weight loss. Let's face it  If diets worked  we'd all be thin already. Why do we keep doing the same thing and expecting different results  Diets may seem harmless  but they actually do a lot of collateral damage. At worst  they ruin lives  Weight obsession leads to eating disorders  especially in young kids. In the U.S.  we have    percent of    year old girls say they've been on a diet. Our daughters have learned to measure their worth by the wrong scale. Even at its best  dieting is a waste of time and energy. It takes willpower which you could be using to help your kids with their homework or to finish that important work project  and because willpower is limited  any strategy that relies on its consistent application is pretty much guaranteed to eventually fail you when your attention moves on to something else. Let me leave you with one last thought. What if we told all those dieting girls that it's okay to eat when they're hungry  What if we taught them to work with their appetite instead of fearing it  I think most of them would be happier and healthier  and as adults  many of them would probably be thinner. I wish someone had told me that back when I was   . Thanks. This is an image of the planet Earth. It looks very much like the Apollo pictures that are very well known. There is something different  you can click on it  and if you click on it  you can zoom in on almost any place on the Earth. For instance  this is a bird's eye view of the EPFL campus. In many cases  you can also see how a building looks from a nearby street. This is pretty amazing. But there's something missing in this wonderful tour  It's time. i'm not really sure when this picture was taken. I'm not even sure it was taken at the same moment as the bird's eye view. In my lab  we develop tools to travel not only in space but also through time. The kind of question we're asking is Is it possible to build something like Google Maps of the past  Can I add a slider on top of Google Maps and just change the year  seeing how it was     years before        years before  Is that possible  Can I reconstruct social networks of the past  Can I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages  So  can I build time machines  Maybe we can just say   No  it's not possible.  Or  maybe  we can think of it from an information point of view. This is what I call the information mushroom. Vertically  you have the time. and horizontally  the amount of digital information available. Obviously  in the last    years  we have much information. And obviously the more we go in the past  the less information we have. If we want to build something like Google Maps of the past  or Facebook of the past  we need to enlarge this space  we need to make that like a rectangle. How do we do that  One way is digitization. There's a lot of material available    newspaper  printed books  thousands of printed books. I can digitize all these. I can extract information from these. Of course  the more you go in the past  the less information you will have. So  it might not be enough. So  I can do what historians do. I can extrapolate. This is what we call  in computer science  simulation. If I take a log book  I can consider  it's not just a log book of a Venetian captain going to a particular journey. I can consider it is actually a log book which is representative of many journeys of that period. I'm extrapolating. If I have a painting of a facade  I can consider it's not just that particular building  but probably it also shares the same grammar of buildings where we lost any information. So if we want to construct a time machine  we need two things. We need very large archives  and we need excellent specialists. The Venice Time Machine  the project I'm going to talk to you about  is a joint project between the EPFL and the University of Venice Ca'Foscari. There's something very peculiar about Venice  that its administration has been very  very bureaucratic. They've been keeping track of everything  almost like Google today. At the Archivio di Stato  you have    kilometers of archives documenting every aspect of the life of Venice over more than       years. You have every boat that goes out  every boat that comes in. You have every change that was made in the city. This is all there. We are setting up a    year digitization program which has the objective of transforming this immense archive into a giant information system. The type of objective we want to reach is     books a day that can be digitized. Of course  when you digitize  that's not enough  because these documents  most of them are in Latin  in Tuscan  in Venetian dialect  so you need to transcribe them  to translate them in some cases  to index them  and this is obviously not easy. In particular  traditional optical character recognition method that can be used for printed manuscripts  they do not work well on the handwritten document. So the solution is actually to take inspiration from another domain  speech recognition. This is a domain of something  that seems impossible  which can actually be done  simply by putting additional constraints. If you have a very good model of a language which is used  if you have a very good model of a document  how well they are structured. And these are administrative documents. They are well structured in many cases. If you divide this huge archive into smaller subsets where a smaller subset actually shares similar features  then there's a chance of success. If we reach that stage  then there's something else  we can extract from this document events. Actually probably    billion events can be extracted from this archive. And this giant information system can be searched in many ways. You can ask questions like   Who lived in this palazzo in         How much cost a sea bream at the Realto market in         What was the salary of a glass maker in Murano maybe over a decade   You can ask even bigger questions because it will be semantically coded. And then what you can do is put that in space  because much of this information is spatial. And from that  you can do things like reconstructing this extraordinary journey of that city that managed to have a sustainable development over a thousand years  managing to have all the time a form of equilibrium with its environment. You can reconstruct that journey  visualize it in many different ways. But of course  you cannot understand  Venice if you just look at the city. You have to put it in a larger European context. So the idea is also to document all the things that worked at the European level. We can reconstruct also the journey of the Venetian maritime empire  how it progressively controlled the Adriatic Sea  how it became the most powerful medieval empire of its time  controlling most of the sea routes from the east to the south. But you can even do other things  because in these maritime routes  there are regular patterns. You can go one step beyond and actually create a simulation system  create a Mediterranean simulator which is capable actually of reconstructing even the information we are missing  which would enable us to have  questions you could ask like if you were using a route planner.  If I am in Corfu in June      and want to go to Constantinople  where can I take a boat   Probably we can answer this question with one or two or three days' precision.  How much will it cost    What are the chance of encountering pirates   Of course  you understand  the central scientific challenge of a project like this one is qualifying  quantifying and representing uncertainty and inconsistency at each step of this process. There are errors everywhere  errors in the document  it's the wrong name of the captain  some of the boats never actually took to sea. There are errors in translation  interpretative biases  and on top of that  if you add algorithmic processes  you're going to have errors in recognition  errors in extraction  so you have very  very uncertain data. So how can we detect and correct these inconsistencies  How can we represent that form of uncertainty  It's difficult. One thing you can do is document each step of the process  not only coding the historical information but what we call the meta historical information  how is historical knowledge constructed  documenting each step. That will not guarantee that we actually converge toward a single story of Venice  but probably we can actually reconstruct a fully documented potential story of Venice. Maybe there's not a single map. Maybe there are several maps. The system should allow for that  because we have to deal with a new form of uncertainty  which is really new for this type of giant databases. And how should we communicate this new research to a large audience  Again  Venice is extraordinary for that. With the millions of visitors that come every year  it's actually one of the best places to try to invent the museum of the future. Imagine  horizontally you see the reconstructed map of a given year  and vertically  you see the document that served the reconstruction  paintings  for instance. Imagine an immersive system that permits to go and dive and reconstruct the Venice of a given year  some experience you could share within a group. On the contrary  imagine actually that you start from a document  a Venetian manuscript  and you show  actually  what you can construct out of it  how it is decoded  how the context of that document can be recreated. This is an image from an exhibit which is currently conducted in Geneva with that type of system. So to conclude  we can say that research in the humanities is about to undergo an evolution which is maybe similar to what happened to life sciences    years ago. It's really a question of scale. We see projects which are much beyond any single research team can do  and this is really new for the humanities  which very often take the habit of working in small groups or only with a couple of researchers. When you visit the Archivio di Stato  you feel this is beyond what any single team can do  and that should be a joint and common effort. So what we must do for this paradigm shift is actually foster a new generation of  digital humanists  that are going to be ready for this shift. I thank you very much. For any of you who have visited or lived in New York City  these shots might start to look familiar. This is Central Park  one of the most beautifully designed public spaces in America. But to anyone who hasn't visited  these images can't really fully convey. To really understand Central Park  you have to physically be there. Well  the same is true of the music  which my brother and I composed and mapped specifically for Central Park. I'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother Hays and I are doing    That's us there. That's both of us actually   specifically about a concept that we've been developing over the last few years  this idea of location aware music. Now  my brother and I  we're musicians and music producers. We've been working together since  well  since we were kids  really. But recently  we've become more and more interested in projects where art and technology intersect  from creating sight specific audio and video installation to engineering interactive concerts. But today I want to focus on this concept of composition for physical space. But before I go too much further into that  let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea. My brother and I were living in New York City when the artists Christo and Jeanne Claude did their temporary installation  The Gates  in Central Park. Hundreds of these brightly colored sculptures decorated the park for a number of weeks  and unlike work that's exhibited in a more neutral space  like on the walls of a gallery or a museum  this was work that was really in dialogue with this place  and in a lot of ways  The Gates was really a celebration of Frederick Olmsted's incredible design. This was an experience that stayed with us for a long time  and years later  my brother and I moved back to Washington  D.C.  and we started to ask the question  would it be possible  in the same way that The Gates responded to the physical layout of the park  to compose music for a landscape  Which brought us to this. On Memorial Day  we released  The National Mall   a location aware album released exclusively as a mobile app that uses the device's built in GPS functionality to sonically map the entire park in our hometown of Washington  D.C. Hundreds of musical segments are geo tagged throughout the entire park so that as a listener traverses the landscape  a musical score is actually unfolding around them. So this is not a playlist or a list of songs intended for the park  but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms that fit together like pieces of a puzzle and blend seamlessly based on a listener's chosen trajectory. So think of this as a choose your own adventure of an album. Let's take a closer look. Let's look at one example here. So using the app  as you make your way towards the grounds surrounding the Washington Monument  you hear the sounds of instruments warming up  which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron spelling out a very simple melody. This is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins. Keep walking  and a full choir joins in  until you finally reach the top of the hill and you're hearing the sound of drums and fireworks and all sorts of musical craziness  as if all of these sounds are radiating out from this giant obelisk that punctuates the center of the park. But were you to walk in the opposite direction  this entire sequence happens in reverse. And were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park  the music would fade to silence  and the play button would disappear. We're sometimes contacted by  people in other parts of the world who can't travel to the United States  but would like to hear this record. Well  unlike a normal album  we haven't been able to accommodate this request. When they ask for a C.D. or an MP  version  we just can't make that happen  and the reason is because this isn't a promotional app or a game to promote or accompany the release of a traditional record. In this case  the app is the work itself  and the architecture of the landscape is intrinsic to the listening experience. Six months later  we did a location aware album for Central Park  a park that is over two times the size of the National Mall  with music spanning from the Sheep's Meadow to the Ramble to the Reservoir. Currently  my brother and I are working on projects all over the country  but last spring we started a project  here actually at Stanford's Experimental Media Art Department  where we're creating our largest location aware album to date  one that will span the entirety of Highway   here on the Pacific Coast. But what we're doing  integrating GPS with music  is really just one idea. But it speaks to a larger vision for a music industry that's sometimes struggled to find its footing in this digital age  that they begin to see these new technologies not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles to an existing model  but to dream up entirely new ways for people to interact with and experience music. Thank you. The entire model of capitalism and the economic model that you and I did business in  and  in fact  continue to do business in  was built around what probably Milton Friedman put more succinctly. And Adam Smith  of course   the father of modern economics actually said many  many years ago  the invisible hand  which is   If you continue to operate in your own self interest you will do the best good for society.  Now  capitalism has done a lot of good things and I've talked about a lot of good  things that have happened  but equally  it has not been able to meet up with some of the challenges that we've seen in society. The model that at least I was brought up in and a lot of us doing business were brought up in was one which talked about what I call the three G's of growth  growth that is consistent  quarter on quarter  growth that is competitive  better than the other person  and growth that is profitable  so you continue to make more and more shareholder value. And I'm afraid this is not going to be good enough and we have to move from this  G model to a model of what I call the fourth G  the G of growth that is responsible. And it is this that has to become a very important part of creating value. Of not just creating economic value but creating social value. And companies that will thrive are those that will actually embrace the fourth G. And the model of  G is quite simple  Companies cannot afford  to be just innocent bystanders in what's happening around in society. They have to begin to play their role in terms of serving the communities which actually sustain them. And we have to move to a model of an and and model which is how do we make money and do good  How do we make sure that we have a great business but we also have a great environment around us  And that model is all about doing well and doing good. But the question is easier said than done. But how do we actually get that done  And I do believe that the answer to that is going to be leadership. It is going to be to redefine the new business models which understand that the only license to operate is to combine these things. And for that you need businesses that can actually define their role in society in terms of a much larger purpose than the products and brands that they sell. And companies that actually define a true north  things that are nonnegotiable whether times are good  bad  ugly    doesn't matter. There are things that you stand for. Values and purpose are going to be the two drivers of software that are going to create the companies of tomorrow. And I'm going to now shift to talking a little bit about my own experiences. I joined Unilever in      as a management trainee in India. And on my first day of work I walked in and my boss tells me   Do you know why you're here   I said   I'm here to sell a lot of soap.  And he said    No  you're here to change lives.  You're here to change lives. You know  I thought it was rather facetious. We are a company that sells soap and soup. What are we doing about changing lives  And it's then I realized that simple acts like selling a bar of soap can save more lives than pharmaceutical companies. I don't know how many of you know that five million children don't reach the age of five because of simple infections that can be prevented by an act of washing their hands with soap. We run the largest hand washing program in the world. We are running a program on hygiene and health that now touches half a billion people. It's not about selling soap  there is a larger purpose out there. And brands indeed can be at the forefront of social change. And the reason for that is  when two billion people use your brands that's the amplifier. Small actions can make a big difference. Take another example  I was walking around in  one of our villages in India. Now those of you who have done this will realize that this is no walk in the park. And we had this lady who was one of our small distributors    beautiful  very  very modest  her home    and she was out there  dressed nicely  her husband in the back  her mother in law behind and her sister in law behind her. The social order was changing because this lady is part of our Project Shakti that is actually teaching women how to do small business and how to carry the message of nutrition and hygiene. We have        such women now in India. It's not about selling soap  it's about making sure that in the process of doing so you can change people's lives. Small actions  big difference. Our R D folks are not only working to give us  some fantastic detergents  but they're working to make sure we use less water. A product that we've just launched recently  One Rinse product that allows you to save water every time you wash your clothes. And if we can convert all our users to using this  that's     billion liters of water. By the way  that's equivalent to one month of water for a whole huge continent. So just think about it. There are small actions that  can make a big difference. And I can go on and on. Our food chain  our brilliant products    and I'm sorry I'm giving you  a word from the sponsors    Knorr  Hellman's and all those wonderful products. We are committed to making sure that all our agricultural raw materials are sourced from sustainable sources      percent sustainable sources. We were the first to say we are going to buy all of our palm oil from sustainable sources. I don't know how many of you know that palm oil  and not buying it from sustainable sources  can create deforestation that is responsible for    percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world. We were the first to embrace that  and it's all because we market soap and soup. And the point I'm making here is that companies like yours  companies like mine have to define a purpose which embraces responsibility and understands that we have to play our part in the communities in which we operate. We introduced something called The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan  which said   Our purpose is to make  sustainable living commonplace  and we are gong to change the lives of one billion people over     .  Now the question here is  where do we go from here  And the answer to that is very simple  We're not going to change the world alone. There are plenty of you and plenty of us who understand this. The question is  we need partnerships  we need coalitions and importantly  we need that leadership that will allow us to take this from here and to be the change that we want to see around us. Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here in Edinburgh  Scotland  the birthplace of the needle and syringe. Less than a mile from here in this direction  in      a Scotsman filed his very first patent on the needle and syringe. His name was Alexander Wood  and it was at the Royal College of Physicians. This is the patent. What blows my mind when I look at it even today is that it looks almost identical to the needle in use today. Yet  it's     years old. So we turn to the field of vaccines. Most vaccines are delivered with the needle and syringe   this     year old technology. And credit where it's due    on many levels  vaccines are a successful technology. After clean water and sanitation  vaccines are the one technology that has increased our life span the most. That's a pretty hard act to beat. But just like any other technology  vaccines have their shortcomings  and the needle and syringe is a key part within that narrative    this old technology. So let's start with the obvious  Many of us don't like the needle and syringe. I share that view. However     percent of the population have a thing called needle phobia. That's more than disliking the needle  that is actively avoiding being vaccinated because of needle phobia. And that's problematic in terms  of the rollout of vaccines. Now  related to this is another key issue  which is needlestick injuries. And the WHO has figures that suggest about  .  million deaths per year take place due to cross contamination with needlestick injuries. These are early deaths that take place. Now  these are two things that  you probably may have heard of  but there are two other shortcomings of the needle and syringe you  may not have heard about. One is it could be holding back the next generation of vaccines in terms of their immune responses. And the second is that it could be responsible for the problem of the cold chain that I'll tell you about as well. I'm going to tell you about some work that my team and I are doing in Australia at the University of Queensland on a technology designed to  tackle those four problems. And that technology is called the Nanopatch. Now  this is a specimen of the Nanopatch. To the naked eye it just looks like a square smaller than a postage stamp  but under a microscope what you see are thousands of tiny projections that are invisible to the human eye. And there's about       projections on this particular square compared to the needle. And I've designed those projections to serve a key role  which is to  work with the skin's immune system. So that's a very important function tied in with the Nanopatch. Now we make the Nanopatch with a technique called deep reactive ion etching. And this particular technique  is one that's been borrowed from the semiconductor industry  and therefore is low cost and can be rolled out in large numbers. Now we dry coat vaccines to  the projections of the Nanopatch and apply it to the skin. Now  the simplest form of application is using our finger  but our finger has some limitations  so we've devised an applicator. And it's a very simple device    you could call it a sophisticated finger. It's a spring operated device. What we do is when we apply  the Nanopatch to the skin as so    immediately a few things happen. So firstly  the projections on the Nanopatch breach through the tough outer layer and the vaccine is very quickly released    within less than a minute  in fact. Then we can take the Nanopatch off and discard it. And indeed we can make  a reuse of the applicator itself. So that gives you an idea of the Nanopatch  and immediately you can see some key advantages. We've talked about it being needle free    these are projections that you can't even see    and  of course  we get around the needle phobia issue as well. Now  if we take a step back and think about these other two really important advantages  One is improved immune  responses through delivery  and the second is getting rid of the cold chain. So let's start with the first one   this immunogenicity idea. It takes a little while to get our heads around  but I'll try to explain it in simple terms. So I'll take a step back and explain to you how vaccines work in a simple way. So vaccines work by introducing into our body a thing called an antigen which is a safe form of a germ. Now that safe germ  that antigen  tricks our body into mounting an immune response  learning and remembering  how to deal with intruders. When the real intruder comes along the body quickly mounts an immune response to deal with that vaccine and neutralizes the infection. So it does that well. Now  the way it's done today  with the needle and syringe  most vaccines are delivered that way    with this old technology and the needle. But it could be argued that the needle  is holding back our immune responses  it's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin. To describe this idea  we need to take a journey through the skin  starting with one of those projections and applying the Nanopatch to the skin. And we see this kind of data. Now  this is real data    that thing that we can see there is one projection from the Nanopatch that's been applied to the skin and those colors are different layers. Now  to give you an idea of scale  if the needle was shown here  it would be too big. It would be    times bigger than the size of that screen  going    times deeper as well. It's off the grid entirely. You can see immediately that we  have those projections in the skin. That red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin  but the brown layer and the magenta layer are jammed full of immune cells. As one example  in the brown layer there's a certain type of cell  called a Langerhans cell    every square millimeter of our body is jammed full of those Langerhans cells  those immune cells  and  there's others shown as well that we haven't stained in this image. But you can immediately see that the Nanopatch achieves that penetration indeed. We target thousands upon thousands  of these particular cells just residing within a hair's width of the surface of the skin. Now  as the guy that's invented this thing and designed it to do that  I found that exciting. But so what  So what if you've targeted cells  In the world of vaccines  what does that mean  The world of vaccines is getting better. It's getting more systematic. However  you still don't really know if a vaccine is going to work until you roll your sleeves up and vaccinate and wait. It's a gambler's game even today. So  we had to do that gamble. We obtained an influenza vaccine  we applied it to our Nanopatches and we applied the Nanopatches to the skin  and we waited    and this is in the live animal. We waited a month  and this is what we found out. This is a data slide showing the immune responses that we've generated with a Nanopatch compared to the needle and syringe into muscle. So on the horizontal axis we have  the dose shown in nanograms. On the vertical axis we have  the immune response generated  and that dashed line indicates  the protection threshold. If we're above that line it's considered protective  if we're below that line it's not. So the red line is mostly below that curve and indeed there's only one point that  is achieved with the needle that's protective  and that's with a high dose of       nanograms. But notice immediately the distinctly different curve that we achieve with the blue line. That's what's achieved with the Nanopatch  the delivered dose of the Nanopatch is a completely different immunogenicity curve. That's a real fresh opportunity. Suddenly we have a brand new lever in the world of vaccines. We can push it one way  where we can take a vaccine  that works but is too expensive and can get protection with a hundredth of the dose  compared to the needle. That can take a vaccine that's suddenly     dollars down to    cents  and that's particularly important  within the developing world. But there's another angle to this as well    you can take vaccines that currently don't work and get them over that line and get them protective. And certainly in the world of vaccines that can be important. Let's consider the big three  HIV  malaria  tuberculosis. They're responsible for about    million deaths per year  and there is no adequate vaccination  method for any of those. So potentially  with this new lever  that we have with the Nanopatch  we can help make that happen. We can push that lever to help get those  candidate vaccines over the line. Now  of course  we've worked within my lab with many other vaccines that have attained similar responses and similar curves to this  what we've achieved with influenza. I'd like to now switch to talk about another key shortcoming of today's vaccines  and that is the need to maintain the cold chain. As the name suggests    the cold chain    it's the requirements of keeping  a vaccine right from production all the way through to when the vaccine is applied  to keep it refrigerated. Now  that presents some logistical challenges but we have ways to do it. This is a slightly extreme case in point but it helps illustrate the logistical challenges  in particular in resource poor settings  of what's required to get vaccines refrigerated and maintain the cold chain. If the vaccine is too warm the vaccine breaks down  but interestingly it can be too cold and the vaccine can break down as well. Now  the stakes are very high. The WHO estimates that within Africa  up to half the vaccines used there are considered to not be working properly because at some point the  cold chain has fallen over. So it's a big problem  and it's tied  in with the needle and syringe because it's a liquid form vaccine  and  when it's liquid it needs the refrigeration. A key attribute of our Nanopatch is that the vaccine is dry  and when it's dry it doesn't need refrigeration. Within my lab we've shown that we can keep the vaccine stored at    degrees Celsius for more than a year without  any loss in activity at all. That's an important improvement. We're delighted about it as well. And the thing about it is that we have well and truly proven the Nanopatch within the laboratory setting. And as a scientist  I love that and I love science. However  as an engineer  as a biomedical engineer and also as a human being  I'm not going to be satisfied until we've rolled this thing  out  taken it out of the lab and got it to people in large numbers and particularly the people that need it the most. So we've commenced this particular journey  and we've commenced this  journey in an unusual way. We've started with Papua New Guinea. Now  Papua New Guinea is an example  of a developing world country. It's about the same size as France  but it suffers from many of the key barriers existing within the world of today's vaccines. There's the logistics  Within this country there are only      refrigerators to keep vaccines chilled. Many of them are old  like this one in Port Moresby  many of them are breaking down and many are not in the Highlands  where they are required. That's a challenge. But also  Papua New Guinea has the  world's highest incidence of HPV  human papillomavirus  the  cervical cancer  risk factor . Yet  that vaccine is not available in large numbers because it's too expensive. So for those two reasons  with  the attributes of the Nanopatch  we've got into the field and  worked with the Nanopatch  and taken it to Papua New Guinea and we'll be following that up shortly. Now  doing this kind of work is not easy. It's challenging  but there's nothing else in  the world I'd rather be doing. And as we look ahead I'd like to share with you a thought  It's the thought of a future where the    million deaths per year that we currently have due to infectious disease is a historical footnote. And it's a historical footnote that has been achieved by improved  radically improved vaccines. Now standing here today in front of you at the birthplace of the needle and syringe  a device that's     years old  I'm presenting to you an alternative approach that could really help make that happen    and it's the Nanopatch with its attributes  of being needle free  pain free  the ability for removing the cold chain and improving the immunogenicity. Thank you. Pat Mitchell  Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage. Sheryl Sandberg  First time back. Nice to see everyone. It's always so nice to look out and see so many women. It's so not my regular experience   as I know anyone else's. PM  So when we first started talking about  maybe the subject wouldn't be social media  which we assumed it would be  but  that you had very much on your mind the missing leadership positions  particularly  in the sector of technology and social media. But how did that evolve for you as a thought  and end up being the TED Talk that you gave  SS  So I was really scared to get on  this stage and talk about women  because I grew up in the business  world  as I think so many of us did. You never talk about being a woman  because  someone might notice that you're a woman  right  They might notice. Or worse  if you say  woman    people on the other end of the table think you're asking for special  treatment  or complaining. Or worse  about to sue them.  And so I went through     Laughter  Right  I went through my entire business career  and never spoke about being a woman   never spoke about it publicly. But I also had noticed that it wasn't working. I came out of college over     years ago  and I thought that all of my peers were men and women   all the people above me were all men  but that would change  because your generation had done such  an amazing job fighting for equality  equality was now ours for the taking. And it wasn't. Because year after year  I was one of fewer and fewer  and now  often the only woman in a room. And I talked to a bunch of people about  should I give a speech at TEDWomen  about women  and they said  oh no  no. It will end your business career. You  cannot be a serious business executive and speak about being a woman.  You'll never be taken seriously again. But fortunately  there were the few  the proud    like you    who told me I should give the speech  and I asked myself the question  Mark Zuckerberg might    the founder of Facebook and my boss    asks all of us  which is  what  would I do if I wasn't afraid  And the answer to what would I do if I wasn't  afraid is I would get on the TED stage  and talk about women  and leadership.  And I did  and survived.  Applause  PM  I would say  not only survived.  I'm thinking of that moment  Sheryl  when you and I were standing backstage  together  and you turned to me  and you told me a story. And I said    very last minute    you know   you really should share that story. SS  Oh  yeah. PM  What was that story  SS  Well  it's an important part of the  journey. So I had    TEDWomen    the original one was in D.C.    so I live here   so I had gotten on a plane the day before  and my daughter was three  she was  clinging to my leg   Mommy  don't go.  And Pat's a friend  and so  not related  to the speech I was planning on giving  which was chock full of facts and  figures  and nothing personal  I told Pat the story. I said  well   I'm having a hard day. Yesterday my daughter was clinging  to my leg  and  Don't go.  And you looked at me and said   you have to tell that story. I said  on the TED stage  Are you kidding  I'm going to get on a stage and admit  my daughter was clinging to my leg  And you said yes  because if you want to talk  about getting more women into leadership roles  you have to be honest about how hard it is. And I did. And I think that's a really  important part of the journey. The same thing happened when I wrote my book.  I started writing the book. I wrote a first chapter  I thought it was fabulous. It was  chock full of data and figures  I had three pages on matrilineal Maasai  tribes  and their sociological patterns. My husband read it and he was like  this  is like eating your Wheaties.  Laughter  No one    and I apologize to Wheaties if there's  someone    no one  no one will read this book. And I realized through the process that I  had to be more honest and more open  and I had to tell my stories. My stories of still  not feeling as self confident as I should  in many situations. My first and  failed marriage. Crying at work. Felling like I didn't belong there   feeling guilty to this day. And part of my journey  starting on this stage   going to  Lean In   going to the foundation  is all about being more open and  honest about those challenges  so that other women can be more open and honest  and all of us can work together towards real equality. PM  I think that one of the most  striking parts about the book  and in my opinion  one of the reasons it's hit such  a nerve and is resonating around the world  is that you are personal in the book   and that you do make it clear that  while you've observed some things that are  very important for other women to know  that you've had the same challenges  that many others of us have  as you faced the hurdles and the barriers and  possibly the people who don't believe the same. So talk about that process  deciding  you'd go public with the private part  and then you would also put yourself in  the position of something of an expert on how to resolve those challenges. SS  After I did the TED Talk  what happened was    you know  I never really expected to write  a book  I'm not an author  I'm not a writer  and it was viewed a lot  and it really  started impacting people's lives. I got this great     one of the first  letters I got was from a woman who said that she was offered a really big  promotion at work  and she turned it down  and she told her best friend she turned  it down  and her best friend said  you really need to watch this TED Talk. And so she watched this TED Talk  and she  went back the next day  she took the job  she went home  and she handed her  husband the grocery list.  Laughter  And she said  I can do this. And what really mattered to me    it wasn't  only women in the corporate world  even though I did hear from a lot of  them  and it did impact a lot of them  it was also people of all different circumstances. There was a doctor I met who was an  attending physician at Johns Hopkins  and he said that until he saw my TED  Talk  it never really occurred to him that even though half the students in  his med school classes were women  they weren't speaking as much as  the men as he did his rounds. So he started paying attention  and as he waited for  raised hands  he realized the men's hands were up. So he started encouraging the  women to raise their hands more  and it still didn't work. So he told everyone  no more  hand raising  I'm cold calling. So he could call evenly on men and women.  And what he proved to himself was that the women knew the answers just as well or better  and he was able to go back  to them and tell them that. And then there was the woman  stay at home  mom  lives in a really difficult neighborhood  with not a great school  she said that TED  Talk    she's never had a corporate job  but that TED Talk inspired her to go to her school  and fight for a better teacher for her child. And I guess it was part of was finding my own voice. And I realized that other women and  men could find their voice through it  which is why I went from the talk to the book. PM  And in the book  you not only found your  voice  which is clear and strong in the book  but you also share what you've learned    the experiences of other people in the lessons. And that's what I'm thinking about  in terms of putting yourself in a    you became a sort of expert in how you lean in. So what did that feel like  and  become like in your life  To launch not just a book  not just  a best selling  best viewed talk  but a movement  where people began to  literally describe their actions at work as  I'm leaning in. SS  I mean  I'm grateful  I'm honored   I'm happy  and it's the very beginning. So I don't know if I'm an expert  or if anyone is  an expert. I certainly have done a lot of research. I have read every study  I have  pored over the materials  and the lessons are very clear.  Because here's what we know  What we know is that stereotypes are holding women  back from leadership roles all over the world. It's so striking.  Lean In  is very global   I've been all over the world  talking about it  and    cultures are so different. Even within our own country  to Japan   to Korea  to China  to Asia  Europe  they're so different. Except for one thing  gender. All over the world  no matter what our cultures are  we think men should be strong   assertive  aggressive  have voice  we think women should speak  when spoken to  help others. Now we have  all over the world  women are called  bossy.   There is a word for  bossy   for little girls  in every language there's one. It's a word that's pretty much not used for little boys  because if a little boy leads   there's no negative word for it  it's expected. But if a little girl leads  she's bossy. Now I know there aren't a lot of  men here  but bear with me. If you're a man  you'll have  to represent your gender. Please raise your hand if you've been  told you're too aggressive at work. If you're a woman  please raise your hand if you've  ever been told you're too aggressive at work. and it's deeply supported by the data. Now  do we think women are more  aggressive than men  Of course not. It's just that we judge them through a different lens  and a lot of the character traits that you must  exhibit to perform at work  to get results  to lead  are ones that we think  in a man  he's a boss  and in a woman  she's bossy. And the good news about this is that we  can change this by acknowledging it. One of the happiest moments  I had in this whole journey is  after the book came out  I stood on a stage  with John Chambers  the CEO of Cisco. He read the book. He stood on a stage with me  he  invited me in front of his whole management team  men and women  and he said  I thought we  were good at this. I thought I was good at this. And then I read this book  and I  realized that we    my company    we have called all of our  senior women too aggressive  and I'm standing on this stage  and I'm sorry. And I want you to know we're  never going to do it again. PM  Can we send that to a lot of other  people that we know   Applause  SS  And so John is doing that because  he believes it's good for his company  and so this kind of acknowledgement  of these biases can change it. And so next time you all see  someone call a little girl  bossy   you walk right up to that person   big smile  and you say   That little girl's not bossy. That little girl has  executive leadership skills.   Laughter  PM  I know that's what you're telling your daughter.  SS  Absolutely. PM  And you did focus in the book    and  the reason  as you said  in writing it  was to create a dialogue about this. I mean  let's just put it out there   face the fact that women are    in a time when we have more open  doors  and more opportunities    are still not getting to the leadership positions. So in the months that have come since the book  in which  Lean In  focused on that and said  here are some of the challenges that remain  and  many of them we have to own within ourselves and look at ourselves. What has changed  Have you seen changes  SS  Well  there's certainly more  dialogue  which is great. But what really matters to me   and I think all of us  is action. So everywhere I go  CEOs   they're mostly men  say to me  you're costing me so much money because all the women want to  be paid as much as the men. And to them I say  I'm not sorry at all.  Laughter  At all. I mean  the women should  be paid as much as the men. Everywhere I go  women tell me they ask for raises. Everywhere I go  women say they're getting  better relationships with their spouses  asking for more help at home  asking for the  promotions they should be getting at work  and importantly  believing it  themselves. Even little things. One of the governors of one of the states told me  that he didn't realize that more women were  in fact  literally sitting on the side  of the room  which they are  and now he made a rule that all the women  on his staff need to sit at the table. The foundation I started along  with the book  Lean In  helps women  or men  start circles    small groups  it can be     it can be however many  you want  which meet once a month. I would have hoped that by now  we'd have  about     circles. That would've been great. You know      times roughly   . There are over        circles  in    countries in the world. PM  Wow  that's amazing. SS  And these are people who  are meeting every single month. I met one of them  I was in Beijing. A group of women  they're all about    or      they started the first Lean In circle in Beijing  several of them grew up in very poor  rural China. These women are     they are told by  their society that they are  left over   because they are not yet married  and the process of coming together  once a month at a meeting is helping them define who they are for themselves. What they want in their careers. The  kind of partners they want  if at all. I looked at them  we went around  and introduced ourselves  and they all said their names  and where they're from  and I said  I'm Sheryl Sandberg   and this was my dream. And I kind of just started crying. Right  which  I admit  I do. Right   I've talked about it before. But the fact that a woman so far away out in  the world  who grew up in a rural village  who's being told to marry someone  she doesn't want to marry  can now go meet once a month with  a group of people and refuse that  and find life on her own terms. That's the kind of change we have to hope for. PM  Have you been surprised by  the global nature of the message  Because I think when the book first  came out  many people thought  well  this is a really important handbook  for young women on their way up. They need to look at this  anticipate  the barriers  and recognize them  put them out in the open  have the dialogue about it  but that it's really for women who are that.  Doing that. Pursuing the corporate world. And yet the book is being read  as you  say  in rural and developing countries. What part of that has surprised you  and  perhaps led to a new perspective on your part  SS  The book is about self confidence   and about equality. And it turns out  everywhere in the world   women need more self confidence  because the world tells us we're not equal to men. Everywhere in the world  we live in  a world where the men get  and   and women get  or.  I've never met a man who's been  asked how he does it all.  Laughter  Again  I'm going to turn to the men in the audience  Please raise your hand if you've  been asked  how do you do it all  Men only. Women  women. Please raise your hand  if you've been asked how you do it all  We assume men can do it all   slash    have jobs and children. We assume women can't  and that's ridiculous  because the great majority of women everywhere  in the world  including the United States  work full time and have children. And I think people don't fully understand  how broad the message is. There is a circle that's been started  for rescued sex workers in Miami. They're using  Lean In  to help  people make the transition back to what would be a fair life  really rescuing  them from their pimps  and using it. There are dress for success groups  in Texas which are using the book  for women who have never been to college. And we know there are groups  all the way to Ethiopia. And so these messages of equality    of how women  are told they can't have what men can have    how we assume that leadership is for men   how we assume that voice is for men  these affect all of us  and I  think they are very universal. And it's part of what TEDWomen does. It unites all of us in a cause we have to believe in  which is more women  more voice  more equality. PM  If you were invited now to  make another TEDWomen talk  what would you say that is a result  of this experience  for you personally  and what you've learned about women  and men  as you've made this journey  SS  I think I would say    I tried to say this strongly  but I think I can say it more strongly    I want to say that the status quo is not enough. That it's not good enough  that it's  not changing quickly enough. Since I gave my TED Talk and published my book   another year of data came out from the U.S. Census. And you know what we found  No movement in the wage gap  for women in the United States. Seventy seven cents to the dollar. If you are a black woman     cents. If you are a Latina  we're at    cents. Do you know when the last  time those numbers went up      . We are stagnating  we are  stagnating in so many ways. And I think we are not really being honest about that  for so many reasons. It's so  hard to talk about gender. We shy away from the word  feminist    a word I really think we need to embrace. We have to get rid of the  word bossy and bring back    I think I would say in a louder voice   we need to get rid of the word  bossy  and bring back the word  feminist    because we need it. PM  And we all need to do a lot more leaning in. SS  A lot more leaning in. PM  Thank you  Sheryl. Thanks for leaning in and saying yes. SS  Thank you. Two years ago  I have to say there was no problem. Two years ago  I knew exactly  what an icon looked like. It looks like this. Everybody's icon  but also the default position of a curator of Italian Renaissance  paintings  which I was then. And in a way  this is also another default selection. Leonardo da Vinci's exquisitely soulful image of the  Lady with an Ermine.  And I use that word  soulful  deliberately. Or then there's this  or rather these  the two versions of Leonardo's  Virgin of the Rocks  that were about to come together  in London for the very first time. In the exhibition that I was then in  the absolute throes of organizing. I was literally up to my eyes in Leonardo  and I had been for three years. So  he was occupying every part of my brain. Leonardo had taught me  during that three years  about what a picture can do. About taking you from your own  material world into a spiritual world. He said  actually  that he believed  the job of the painter was to paint everything that was visible  and invisible in the universe. That's a huge task. And yet   somehow he achieves it. He shows us  I think  the human soul. He shows us the capacity of ourselves to move into a spiritual realm. To see a vision of the universe that's  more perfect than our own. To see God's own plan  in some sense. So this  in a sense  was really  what I believed an icon was. At about that time  I started talking to Tom Campbell  director here of the Metropolitan Museum  about what my next move might be. The move  in fact  back to an earlier life  one I'd begun at the British Museum  back to the world of three dimensions    of sculpture and of decorative arts    to take over the department of European sculpture  and decorative arts  here at the Met. But it was an incredibly busy time. All the conversations were done  at very peculiar times of the day    over the phone. In the end  I accepted the job without actually having been here. Again  I'd been there a couple of years before  but on that particular visit. So  it was just before the time that  the Leonardo show was due to open when I finally made it back to the Met  to New York  to see my new domain. To see what European sculpture  and decorative arts looked like  beyond those Renaissance collections  with which I was so already familiar. And I thought  on that very first day   I better tour the galleries. Fifty seven of these galleries    like    varieties of baked beans  I believe. I walked through and I started in my comfort zone in the Italian Renaissance. And then I moved gradually around  feeling a little lost sometimes. My head  also still full of the Leonardo exhibition that was about to open  and I came across this. And I thought to myself  What the hell have I done  There was absolutely no connection in my mind at all and  in fact  if there was any emotion going on  it was a kind of repulsion. This object felt utterly and completely alien. Silly at a level that I hadn't yet  understood silliness to be. And then it was made worse    there were two of them. So  I started thinking about why it was  in fact  that I disliked this object so much. What was the anatomy of my distaste  Well  so much gold  so vulgar. You know  so nouveau riche  frankly. Leonardo himself had preached  against the use of gold  so it was absolutely anathema at that moment. And then there's little pretty sprigs  of flowers everywhere.  Laughter  And finally  that pink. That damned pink. It's such an extraordinarily artificial color. I mean  it's a color that I can't think of  anything that you actually see in nature  that looks that shade. The object even has its own tutu.  Laughter  This little flouncy  spangly  bottomy bit that sits at the bottom of the vase. It reminded me  in an odd kind of way  of my niece's fifth birthday party. Where all the little girls would come  either as a princess or a fairy. There was one who would come as a fairy princess. You should have seen the looks. And I realize that this object was in my mind  born from the same mind  from the same womb  practically  as Barbie Ballerina.  Laughter  And then there's the elephants.  Laughter  Those extraordinary elephants with their little  sort of strange  sinister expressions and Greta Garbo eyelashes  with  these golden tusks and so on. I realized this was an elephant that had absolutely nothing to do with a majestic  march across the Serengeti. It was a Dumbo nightmare.  Laughter  But something more profound  was happening as well. These objects  it seemed to me  were quintessentially the kind that I  and my liberal left friends in London had always seen as summing up something deplorable about the French aristocracy in the   th century. The label had told me that these pieces were made by the S vres Manufactory  made of porcelain in the late     s  and designed by a designer called  Jean Claude Duplessis  actually somebody of extraordinary distinction as I later learned. But for me  they summed up a kind of  that sort of sheer uselessness of the aristocracy in the   th century. I and my colleagues had always thought that these objects  in way  summed up the idea of  you know    no wonder there was a revolution. Or  indeed  thank God there was a revolution. There was a sort of idea really  that  if you owned a vase like this  then there was really only one fate possible. So  there I was    in a sort of paroxysm of horror. But I took the job and I went  on looking at these vases. I sort of had to because they're  on a through route in the Met. So  almost anywhere I went  there they were. They had this kind of odd sort of fascination  like a car accident. Where I couldn't stop looking. And as I did so  I started thinking  Well  what are we actually looking at here  And what I started with was understanding this as really a supreme piece of design. It took me a little time. But  that tutu for example    actually  this is a piece that  does dance in its own way. It has an extraordinary lightness and yet  it is also amazing balanced. It has these kinds of sculptural ingredients. And then the play between    actually really quite carefully disposed  color and gilding  and the sculptural surface  is really rather remarkable. And then I realized that this piece went into the kiln four times  at least four times  in order to arrive at this. How many moments for accident can you think of that could have happened to this piece  And then remember  not just one  but two. So he's having to arrive at two exactly matched vases of this kind. And then this question of uselessness. Well actually  the end of the trunks  were originally candle holders. So what you would have had  were candles on either side. Imagine that effect of candlelight on that surface. On the slightly uneven pink  on the beautiful gold. It would have glittered in an interior  a little like a little firework. And at that point  actually   a firework went off in my brain. Somebody reminded me that  that word 'fancy'    which in a sense for me  encapsulated this object    actually comes from the same  root as the word 'fantasy.' And that what this object was just as much in a way  in its own way  as a Leonardo da Vinci painting  is a portal to somewhere else. This is an object of the imagination. If you think about the mad   th century  operas of the time    set in the Orient. If you think about divans and perhaps even  opium induced visions of pink elephants  then at that point  this object starts to make sense. This is an object which is all about escapism. It's about an escapism that happens    that the aristocracy in France sought very deliberately to distinguish themselves from ordinary people. It's not an escapism that we feel particularly happy with today  however. And again  going on thinking about this  I realize that in a way we're all victims of a certain kind of tyranny of the triumph of modernism whereby form and function in an object have to follow one another  or are deemed to do so. And the extraneous ornament is seen as really  essentially  criminal. It's a triumph  in a way  of bourgeois values rather than aristocratic ones. And that seems fine. Except for the fact that it becomes a kind of  sequestration of imagination. So just as in the   th century  so many people had the idea that their faith took place on the Sabbath day  and the rest of their lives    their lives of washing machines and orthodontics    took place on another day. Then  I think we've started doing the same. We've allowed ourselves to lead our fantasy lives in front of screens. In the dark of the cinema  with the television in the corner of the room. We've eliminated  in a sense  that constant of the imagination that these vases  represented in people's lives. So maybe it's time we got this back a little. I think it's beginning to happen. In London  for example  with these extraordinary buildings that have been appearing over the last few years. Redolent  in a sense  of science fiction  turning London into a kind of fantasy playground. It's actually amazing to look out of  a high building nowadays there. But even then  there's a resistance. London has called these buildings the  Gherkin  the Shard  the Walkie Talkie    bringing these soaring buildings down to Earth. There's an idea that we don't want these anxious making  imaginative journeys  to happen in our daily lives. I feel lucky in a way  I've encountered this object. I found him on the Internet when  I was looking up a reference. And there he was. And unlike the pink elephant vase  this was a kind of love at first sight. In fact  reader  I married him. I bought him. And he now adorns my office. He's a Staffordshire figure made  in the middle of the   th century. He represents the actor  Edmund Kean   playing Shakespeare's Richard III. And it's based  actually  on a more  elevated piece of porcelain. So I loved  on an art historical level  I loved that layered quality that he has. But more than that  I love him. In a way that I think would have been impossible without the pink S vres vase in my Leonardo days. I love his orange and pink breeches. I love the fact that he seems to be going off to war  having just finished the washing up.  Laughter  He seems also to have forgotten his sword. I love his pink little cheeks  his munchkin energy. In a way  he's become my sort of alter ego. He's  I hope  a little bit dignified  but mostly rather vulgar.  Laughter  And energetic  I hope  too. I let him into my life because the S vres pink elephant vase allowed me to do so. And before that Leonardo  I understood that this object could become  part of a journey for me every day  sitting in my office. I really hope that others  all of you  visiting objects in the museum  and taking them home and  finding them for yourselves  will allow those objects to flourish  in your imaginative lives. Thank you very much. My job is to design  build and study robots that communicate with people. But this story doesn't start with robotics at all  it starts with animation. When I first saw Pixar's  Luxo Jr.   I was amazed by how much emotion they could put into something as trivial as a desk lamp. I mean  look at them    at the end of this movie  you actually feel something for two pieces of furniture. And I said  I have to learn how to do this. So I made a really bad career decision. And that's what my mom was like when I did it. I left a very cozy tech job in Israel at a nice software company and I moved to New York to study animation. And there I lived in a collapsing apartment building in Harlem with roommates. I'm not using this phrase metaphorically    the ceiling actually collapsed one day in our living room. Whenever they did news stories about building violations in New York  they would put the report in front of our building  as kind of  like  a backdrop to show how bad things are. Anyway  during the day  I went to school and at night I would sit and draw frame by frame of pencil animation. And I learned two surprising lessons. One of them was that when you want to arouse emotions  it doesn't matter so much how something looks  it's all in the motion  in the timing of how the thing moves. And the second was something one of our teachers told us. He actually did the weasel in  Ice Age.  And he said   As an animator  you're not a director    you're an actor.  So  if you want to find the right motion for a character  don't think about it    go use your body to find it. Stand in front of a mirror  act it out in front of a camera    whatever you need    and then put it back in your character. A year later I found myself at MIT in the Robotic Life Group. It was one of the first groups researching the relationships between humans and robots. And I still had this dream to make an actual  physical Luxo Jr. lamp. But I found that robots didn't move at all in this engaging way that I was used to from my animation studies. Instead  they were all    how should I put it    they were all kind of robotic. And I thought  what if I took whatever I learned in animation school  and used that to design my robotic desk lamp. So I went and designed frame by frame to try to make this robot as graceful and engaging as possible. And here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop    and I'm actually redesigning the robot  so  unbeknownst to itself  it's kind of digging its own grave by helping me. I wanted it to be less of a mechanical structure giving me light  and more of a helpful  kind of quiet apprentice that's always there when you need it and doesn't really interfere. And when  for example  I'm looking for a battery that I can't find  in a subtle way  it'll show me where the battery is. So you can see my confusion here. I'm not an actor. And I want you to notice how the same mechanical structure can  at one point  just by the way it moves  seem gentle and caring and in the other case  seem violent and confrontational. And it's the same structure  just the motion is different. Actor   You want to know something  Well  you want to know something  He was already dead  Just laying there  eyes glazed over   But  moving in a graceful way is just one building block of this whole structure called human robot interaction. I was  at the time  doing my PhD  I was working on human robot teamwork  teams of humans and robots working together. I was studying the engineering  the psychology  the philosophy of teamwork  and at the same time  I found myself in my own kind of teamwork situation  with a good friend of mine  who's actually here. And in that situation  we can easily imagine robots in the near future being there with us. It was after a Passover Seder. We were folding up a lot of folding chairs  and I was amazed at how quickly we found our own rhythm. Everybody did their own part  we didn't have to divide our tasks. We didn't have to communicate verbally about this    it all just happened. And I thought  humans and robots don't look at all like this. When humans and robots interact  it's much more like a chess game  the human does a thing  the robot analyzes whatever the human did  the robot decides what to do next  plans it and does it. Then the human waits  until it's their turn again. So it's much more like a chess game  and that makes sense  because chess is great for mathematicians and computer scientists. It's all about information  analysis  decision making and planning. But I wanted my robot to be less of a chess player  and more like a doer that just clicks and works together. So I made my second horrible career choice  I decided to study acting for a semester. I took off from the PhD  I went to acting classes. I actually participated in a play    I hope there s no video of that around still. And I got every book I could find about acting  including one from the   th century that I got from the library. And I was really amazed  because my name was the second name on the list    the previous name was in     . And this book was kind of waiting for     years to be rediscovered for robotics. And this book shows actors how to move every muscle in the body to match every kind of emotion that they want to express. But the real revelation was when I learned about method acting. It became very popular in the   th century. And method acting said you don't have to plan every muscle in your body  instead  you have to use your body to find the right movement. You have to use your sense memory to reconstruct the emotions and kind of think with your body to find the right expression    improvise  play off your scene partner. And this came at the same time as I was reading about this trend in cognitive psychology  called embodied cognition  which also talks about the same ideas. We use our bodies to think  we don't just think with our brains and use our bodies to move  but our bodies feed back into our brain to generate the way that we behave. And it was like a lightning bolt. I went back to my office  I wrote this paper  which I never really published  called  Acting Lessons for Artificial Intelligence.  And I even took another month to do what was then the first theater play with a human and a robot acting together. That's what you saw before with the actors. And I thought  How can we make an artificial intelligence model    a computer  computational model    that will model some of these ideas of improvisation  of taking risks  of taking chances  even of making mistakes  Maybe it can make for better robotic teammates. So I worked for quite a long time on these models and I implemented them on a number of robots. Here you can see a very early example with the robots trying to use this embodied artificial intelligence to try to match my movements as closely as possible. It's sort of like a game. Let's look at it. You can see when I psych it out  it gets fooled. And it's a little bit like what you might see actors do when they try to mirror each other to find the right synchrony between them. And then  I did another experiment  and I got people off the street to use the robotic desk lamp  and try out this idea of embodied artificial intelligence. So  I actually used two kinds of brains for the same robot. The robot is the same lamp that you saw  and I put two brains in it. For one half of the people  I put in a brain that's kind of the traditional  calculated robotic brain. It waits for its turn  it analyzes everything  it plans. Let's call it the calculated brain. The other got more the stage actor  risk taker brain. Let's call it the adventurous brain. It sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know. It sometimes makes mistakes and corrects them. And I had them do this very tedious task that took almost    minutes  and they had to work together  somehow simulating  like  a factory job of repetitively doing the same thing. What I found is that people actually loved the adventurous robot. They thought it was more intelligent  more committed  a better member of the team  contributed to the success of the team more. They even called it  he  and  she   whereas people with the calculated brain called it  it   and nobody ever called it  he  or  she.  When they talked about it after the task  with the adventurous brain  they said   By the end  we were good friends and high fived mentally.  Whatever that means. Sounds painful. Whereas the people with the calculated brain said it was just like a lazy apprentice. It only did what it was supposed to do and nothing more  which is almost what people expect robots to do  so I was surprised that people had higher expectations of robots than what anybody in robotics thought robots should be doing. And in a way  I thought  maybe it's time    just like method acting changed the way people thought about acting in the   th century  from going from the very calculated  planned way of behaving  to a more intuitive  risk taking  embodied way of behaving    maybe it's time for robots to have the same kind of revolution. A few years later  I was at my next research job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta  and I was working in a group dealing with robotic musicians. And I thought  music  that's the perfect place to look at teamwork  coordination  timing  improvisation    and we just got this robot playing marimba. And the marimba  for everybody like me  it was this huge  wooden xylophone. And when I was looking at this  I looked at other works in human robot improvisation    yes  there are other works in human robot improvisation    and they were also a little bit like a chess game. The human would play  the robot analyzed what was played  and would improvise their own part. So  this is what musicians called a call and response interaction  and it also fits very well robots and artificial intelligence. But I thought  if I use the same ideas I used in the theater play and in the teamwork studies  maybe I can make the robots jam together like a band. Everybody's riffing off each other  nobody is stopping for a moment. And so I tried to do the same things  this time with music  where the robot doesn't really know what it's about to play  it just sort of moves its body and uses opportunities to play  and does what my jazz teacher when I was    taught me. She said  when you improvise  sometimes you don't know what you're doing  and you still do it. So I tried to make a robot that doesn't actually know what it's doing  but is still doing it. So let's look at a few seconds from this performance  where the robot listens to the human musician and improvises. And then  look how the human musician also responds to what the robot is doing and picking up from its behavior  and at some point can even be surprised by what the robot came up with. Being a musician is not just about making notes  otherwise nobody would ever go see a live show. Musicians also communicate with their bodies  with other band members  with the audience  they use their bodies to express the music. And I thought  we already have a robot musician on stage  why not make it be a full fledged musician  And I started designing a socially expressive head for the robot. The head doesn t actually touch the marimba  it just expresses what the music is like. These are some napkin sketches from a bar in Atlanta that was dangerously located exactly halfway between my lab and my home. So I spent  I would say  on average  three to four hours a day there. I think. And I went back to my animation tools and tried to figure out not just what a robotic musician would look like  but especially what a robotic musician would move like  to sort of show that it doesn't like what the other person is playing    and maybe show whatever beat it's feeling at the moment. So we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot  which was nice. I'm going to show you now the same kind of performance  this time with a socially expressive head. And notice one thing    how the robot is really showing us the beat it's picking up from the human  while also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it's doing. And also how it changes the way it moves as soon as it starts its own solo. Now it's looking at me  showing that it's listening. Now look at the final chord of the piece again. And this time the robot communicates with its body when it's busy doing its own thing  and when it's ready to coordinate the final chord with me. Thanks. I hope you see how much this part of the body that doesn't touch the instrument actually helps with the musical performance. And at some point    we are in Atlanta  so obviously some rapper will come into our lab at some point    and we had this rapper come in and do a little jam with the robot. Here you can see the robot basically responding to the beat. Notice two things  one  how irresistible it is to join the robot while it's moving its head. You kind of want to move your own head when it does it. And second  even though the rapper is really focused on his iPhone  as soon as the robot turns to him  he turns back. So even though it's just in the periphery of his vision  in the corner of his eye  it's very powerful. And the reason is that we can't ignore physical things moving in our environment. We are wired for that. So if you have a problem    maybe your partner is looking at their iPhone or smartphone too much    you might want to have a robot there to get their attention. Just to introduce the last robot that we've worked on  it came out of something surprising that we found  Some point people didn't care about the robot being intelligent  able to improvise and listen  and do all these embodied intelligence things that I spent years developing. They really liked that the robot was enjoying the music. And they didn't say the robot was moving to the music  they said  enjoying  the music. And we thought  why don't we take this idea  and I designed a new piece of furniture. This time it wasn't a desk lamp  it was a speaker dock  one of those things you plug your smartphone in. And I thought  what would happen if your speaker dock didn't just play the music for you  but would actually enjoy it  too  And so again  here are some animation tests from an early stage. And this is what the final product looked like. So  a lot of bobbing heads. A lot of bobbing heads in the audience  so we can still see robots influence people. And it's not just fun and games. I think one of the reasons I care so much about robots that use their body to communicate and use their body to move is    I'm going to let you in on a little secret we roboticists are hiding    is that every one of you is going to be living with a robot at some point in your life. Somewhere in your future  there will be a robot in your life. If not in yours  your children's lives. And I want these robots to be more fluent  more engaging  more graceful than currently they seem to be. And for that I think maybe robots need to be less like chess players and more like stage actors and more like musicians. Maybe they should be able to take chances and improvise. Maybe they should be able to anticipate what you're about to do. Maybe they even need to be able to make mistakes and correct them  because in the end  we are human. And maybe as humans  robots that are a little less than perfect are just perfect for us. Thank you. So when I was in Morocco  in Casablanca  not so long ago  I met a young unmarried mother called Faiza. Faiza showed me photos of her infant son and she told me the story of his conception  pregnancy  and delivery. It was a remarkable tale  but Faiza saved the best for last.  You know  I am a virgin   she told me.  I have two medical certificates to prove it.  This is the modern Middle East  where two millennia after the coming of Christ  virgin births are still a fact of life. Faiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard  over the years  traveling across the Arab region talking to people about sex. Now  I know this might sound like a dream job  or possibly a highly dubious occupation  but for me  it's something else altogether. I'm half Egyptian  and I'm Muslim. But I grew up in Canada  far from my Arab roots. Like so many who straddle East and West  I've been drawn  over the years  to try to better understand my origins. That I chose to look at sex comes from  my background in HIV AIDS  as a writer and a researcher and an activist. Sex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic in the Middle East and North Africa  which is one of only two regions in the world where HIV AIDS is still on the rise. Now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens with which to study any society  because what happens in our intimate lives is reflected by forces on a bigger stage  in politics and economics  in religion and tradition   in gender and generations. As I found  if you really want to know a people  you start by looking inside their bedrooms. Now to be sure  the Arab world is vast and varied. But running across it are three red lines    these are topics you are not supposed  to challenge in word or deed. The first of these is politics. But the Arab Spring has changed all that  in uprisings which have blossomed  across the region since     . Now while those in power  old and new  continue to cling to business as usual  millions are still pushing back  and pushing forward to what they hope will be a better life. That second red line is religion. But now religion and politics are connected  with the rise of such groups as the  Muslim Brotherhood. And some people  at least  are starting  to ask questions about the role of Islam in public and private life. You know  as for that third red line   that off limits subject  what do you think it might be  Audience  Sex. Shereen El Feki  Louder  I can't hear you. Audience  Sex. SEF  Again  please don't be shy. Audience  Sex. SEF  Absolutely  that's right  it's sex.  Laughter  Across the Arab region  the only accepted context for sex is marriage    approved by your parents  sanctioned by religion and registered by the state. Marriage is your ticket to adulthood. If you don't tie the knot  you can't  move out of your parents' place  and you're not supposed to be having sex  and you're definitely not supposed  to be having children. It's a social citadel  it's an impregnable fortress which resists any assault  any alternative. And around the fortress is this vast field of taboo against premarital sex  against condoms  against abortion  against homosexuality  you name it. Faiza was living proof of this. Her virginity statement was  not a piece of wishful thinking. Although the major religions of the region extoll premarital chastity  in a patriarchy  boys will be boys. Men have sex before marriage  and people more or less turn a blind eye. Not so for women  who are expected to be virgins  on their wedding night    that is  to turn up with your hymen intact. This is not a question of individual concern  this is a matter of family honor   and in particular  men's honor. And so women and their relatives will go to great lengths to preserve  this tiny piece of anatomy    from female genital mutilation  to virginity testing  to hymen repair surgery. Faiza chose a different route  non vaginal sex. Only she became pregnant all the same. But Faiza didn't actually realize this  because there's so little  sexuality education in schools  and so little communication in the family. When her condition became hard to hide  Faiza's mother helped her flee  her father and brothers. This is because honor killings are a real threat for untold numbers of women in the Arab region. And so when Faiza eventually fetched up at  a hospital in Casablanca  the man who offered to help her  instead tried to rape her. Sadly  Faiza is not alone. In Egypt  where my research is focused  I have seen plenty of trouble  in and out of the citadel. There are legions of young men who can't afford to get married  because marriage has become  a very expensive proposition. They are expected to bear the burden of costs in married life  but they can't find jobs. This is one of the major drivers  of the recent uprisings  and it is one of the reasons for the  rising age of marriage in much of the Arab region. There are career women who want to get married  but can't find a husband  because they defy gender expectations  or as one young female doctor  in Tunisia put it to me   The women  they are becoming more and more open. But the man  he is still at the prehistoric stage.  And then there are men and women who  cross the heterosexual line  who have sex with their own sex  or who have a different gender identity. They are on the receiving end of laws which punish their activities  even their appearance. And they face a daily struggle with social stigma  with family despair  and with religious fire and brimstone. Now  it's not as if it's all rosy  in the marital bed either. Couples who are looking for greater happiness  greater sexual happiness in their married lives  but are at a loss of how to achieve it  especially wives  who are afraid  of being seen as bad women if they show some spark in the bedroom. And then there are those whose marriages are actually a veil for prostitution. They have been sold by their families  often to wealthy Arab tourists. This is just one face of a booming  sex trade across the Arab region. Now raise your hand if any of  this is sounding familiar to you  from your part of the world. Yeah. It's not as if the Arab world has a monopoly on sexual hangups. And although we don't yet have an Arab Kinsey Report to tell us exactly what's happening  inside bedrooms across the Arab region  It's pretty clear that  something is not right. Double standards for men and women  sex as a source of shame  family control limiting individual choices  and a vast gulf between appearance and reality  what people are doing and what they're willing to admit to  and a general reluctance to move  beyond private whispers to a serious and sustained public discussion. As one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me   Here  sex is the opposite of sport. Football  everybody talks about it  but hardly anyone plays. But sex  everybody is doing it  but nobody wants to talk about it.   Laughter  SEF  I want to give you a piece of advice  which if you follow it  will make you happy in life. When your husband reaches out to you  when he seizes a part of your body  sigh deeply and look at him lustily. When he penetrates you with his penis  try to talk flirtatiously and  move yourself in harmony with him. Hot stuff  And it might sound that these handy hints come from  The Joy of Sex  or YouPorn. But in fact  they come from a   th century Arabic book called  The Encyclopedia of Pleasure   which covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia  and everything in between. The Encyclopedia is just one  in a long line of Arabic erotica  much of it written by religious scholars. Going right back to the Prophet Muhammad  there is a rich tradition in Islam of talking frankly about sex  not just its problems  but also its pleasures  and not just for men  but also for women. A thousand years ago  we used to have  whole dictionaries of sex in Arabic. Words to cover every conceivable sexual feature  position and preference  a body of language that was rich enough to make up the body  of the woman you see on this page. Today  this history is largely unknown  in the Arab region. Even by educated people  who often feel more comfortable talking about sex in a foreign language than they do in their own tongue. Today's sexual landscape looks a lot like Europe and America on the brink of the sexual revolution. But while the West has opened on sex  what we found is that Arab societies appear to have been moving in the opposite direction. In Egypt and many of its neighbors  this closing down is part of a wider closing in political  social and cultural thought. And it is the product of a complex historical process  one which has gained ground with the rise  of Islamic conservatism since the late     s.  Just say no  is what conservatives  around the world say to any challenge to the sexual status quo. In the Arab region  they brand these attempts as a Western conspiracy to undermine traditional Arab and Islamic values. But what's really at stake here is one of their most powerful tools of control  sex wrapped up in religion. But history shows us that  even as recently as our fathers' and grandfathers' day  there have been times of greater pragmatism  and tolerance  and a willingness to consider other interpretations  be it abortion  or masturbation  or even  the incendiary topic of homosexuality. It is not black and white  as conservatives would have us believe. In these  as in so many other matters  Islam offers us at least    shades of gray. Over my travels  I've met men and women  across the Arab region who've been exploring that spectrum    sexologists who are trying to help couples find greater happiness in their marriages  innovators who are managing to get  sexuality education into schools  small groups of men and women  lesbian  gay  transgendered  transsexual  who are reaching out to their peers with online initiatives and real world support. Women  and increasingly men  who are starting to speak out and push back against sexual violence on the streets and in the home. Groups that are trying to help sex workers protect themselves against HIV and other occupational hazards  and NGOs that are helping unwed mothers like Faiza find a place in society  and critically  stay with their kids. Now these efforts are small   they're often underfunded  and they face formidable opposition. But I am optimistic that  in the long run  times are changing  and they and their ideas will gain ground. Social change doesn't happen in the Arab region through dramatic confrontation  beating or indeed baring of breasts  but rather through negotiation. What we're talking here is not about a  sexual revolution  but a sexual evolution   learning from other parts of the world  adapting to local conditions  forging our own path  not following one blazed by another. That path  I hope  will one day lead us  to the right to control our own bodies  and to access the information  and services we need to lead satisfying and safe sexual lives. The right to express our ideas freely  to marry whom we choose   to choose our own partners  to be sexually active or not  to decide whether to have children and when  all this without violence or force or discrimination. Now we are very far from this  across the Arab region  and so much needs to change  law  education  media  the economy  the list goes on and on  and it is the work of a generation  at least. But it begins with a journey that I myself have made  asking hard questions of received wisdoms in sexual life. And it is a journey which has only served to strengthen my faith  and my appreciation of local histories and cultures by showing me possibilities  where I once only saw absolutes. Now given the turmoil in many countries in the Arab region  talking about sex   challenging the taboos  seeking alternatives might sound like something of a luxury. But at this critical moment in history  if we do not anchor freedom and justice  dignity and equality  privacy and autonomy in our personal lives  in our sexual lives  we will find it very hard to achieve in public life. The political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows  and that is true for us all. no matter where we live and love. Thank you. Some of my most wonderful memories of childhood are of spending time with my grandmother  Mamar  in our four family home in Brooklyn  New York. Her apartment was an oasis. It was a place where I could sneak a cup of coffee  which was really warm milk  with just a touch of caffeine. She loved life. And although she worked in a factory  she saved her pennies and she traveled to Europe. And I remember poring over those pictures with her and then dancing with her to her favorite music. And then  when I was eight and she was     something changed. She no longer worked or traveled. She no longer danced. There were no more coffee times. My mother missed work and took her to doctors who couldn't make a diagnosis. And my father  who worked at night   would spend every afternoon with her  just to make sure she ate. Her care became all consuming for our family. And by the time a diagnosis was made  she was in a deep spiral. Now many of you will recognize her symptoms. My grandmother had depression. A deep  life altering depression  from which she never recovered. And back then  so little  was known about depression. But even today     years later  there's still so much more to learn. Today  we know that women  are    percent more likely to experience depression over their lifetimes compared with men. And even with this high prevalence  women are misdiagnosed between     and    percent of the time. Now we know that women are more likely to experience the symptoms  of fatigue  sleep disturbance  pain and anxiety compared with men. And these symptoms are often overlooked as symptoms of depression. And it isn't only depression in which  these sex differences occur  but they occur across so many diseases. So it's my grandmother's struggles that have really led me on a lifelong quest. And today  I lead a center in which the mission is to discover why these sex differences occur and to use that knowledge to improve the health of women. Today  we know that every cell has a sex. Now  that's a term coined  by the Institute of Medicine. And what it means is that  men and women are different down to the cellular and molecular levels. It means that we're different  across all of our organs. From our brains to our hearts  our lungs  our joints. Now  it was only    years ago that we hardly had any data on women's health beyond our reproductive functions. But then in       the NIH Revitalization Act was signed into law. And what this law did was it mandated that women and minorities  be included in clinical trials that were funded by the National Institutes of Health. And in many ways  the law has worked. Women are now routinely  included in clinical studies  and we've learned that there are major differences in the ways that women and men experience disease. But remarkably  what we have learned about these  differences is often overlooked. So  we have to ask ourselves the question  Why leave women's health to chance  And we're leaving it to chance in two ways. The first is that there is so much more to learn and we're not making the investment in fully understanding the extent  of these sex differences. And the second is that we aren't  taking what we have learned  and routinely applying it in clinical care. We are just not doing enough. So  I'm going to share with you three examples of where sex differences have  impacted the health of women  and where we need to do more. Let's start with heart disease. It's the number one killer of women  in the United States today. This is the face of heart disease. Linda is a middle aged woman  who had a stent placed in one of the arteries going to her heart. When she had recurring symptoms  she went back to her doctor. Her doctor did the gold standard test  a cardiac catheterization. It showed no blockages. Linda's symptoms continued. She had to stop working. And that's when she found us. When Linda came to us  we did  another cardiac catheterization and this time  we found clues. But we needed another test to make the diagnosis. So we did a test called an intracoronary ultrasound  where you use soundwaves to look at the artery from the inside out. And what we found was that Linda's disease didn't look like the typical male disease. The typical male disease looks like this. There's a discrete blockage or stenosis. Linda's disease  like the disease of so many women  looks like this. The plaque is laid down more evenly  more diffusely along the artery  and it's harder to see. So for Linda  and for so many women  the gold standard test wasn't gold. Now  Linda received the right treatment. She went back to her life and  fortunately  today she is doing well. But Linda was lucky. She found us  we found her disease. But for too many women  that's not the case. We have the tools. We have the technology to make the diagnosis. But it's all too often that these sex diffferences are overlooked. So what about treatment  A landmark study that was published two years ago asked the very important question  What are the most effective treatments  for heart disease in women  The authors looked at papers  written over a    year period  and hundreds had to be thrown out. And what they found out was that  of those that were tossed out     percent were excluded because even though women  were included in the studies  the analysis didn't differentiate  between women and men. What a lost opportunity. The money had been spent and we didn't learn how women fared. And these studies could not contribute one iota to the very  very important question  what are the most effective treatments for heart disease in women  I want to introduce you to  Hortense  my godmother  Hung Wei  a relative of a colleague  and somebody you may recognize    Dana  Christopher Reeve's wife. All three women have something  very important in common. All three were diagnosed with lung cancer  the number one cancer killer of women in the United States today. All three were nonsmokers. Sadly  Dana and Hung Wei died of their disease. Today  what we know is that women who are nonsmokers are three times more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men who are nonsmokers. Now interestingly  when women are  diagnosed with lung cancer  their survival tends to be better than that of men. Now  here are some clues. Our investigators have found that there are certain genes in the lung tumor  cells of both women and men. And these genes are activated mainly by estrogen. And when these genes are over expressed  it's associated with improved survival only in young women. Now this is a very early finding and we don't yet know whether it has relevance to clinical care. But it's findings like this that may provide hope and may provide an opportunity to save lives of both women and men. Now  let me share with you an example of when we do consider sex differences  it can drive the science. Several years ago a new lung cancer drug was being evaluated  and when the authors looked  at whose tumors shrank  they found that    percent were women. This led them to ask the question  Well  why  And what they found was that the genetic mutations  that the drug targeted were far more common in women. And what this has led to is a more personalized approach to the treatment of lung cancer  that also includes sex. This is what we can accomplish when we don't leave women's health to chance. We know that when you invest in research  you get results. Take a look at the death rate  from breast cancer over time. And now take a look at the death rates from lung cancer in women over time. Now let's look at the dollars  invested in breast cancer    these are the dollars invested per death    and the dollars invested in lung cancer. Now  it's clear that our investment in breast cancer has produced results. They may not be fast enough  but it has produced results. We can do the same for lung cancer and for every other disease. So let's go back to depression. Depression is the number one cause of disability in women in the world today. Our investigators have found that there are differences in the brains of women and men in the areas that are connected with mood. And when you put men and women in a functional MRI scanner    that's the kind of scanner that shows how the brain is functioning when it's activated    so you put them in the scanner  and you expose them to stress. You can actually see the difference. And it's findings like this that we believe hold some of the clues for why we see these very significant sex differences in depression. But even though we know that these differences occur     percent of the brain research that begins in animals is done in either male animals or animals in whom the sex is not identified. So  I think we have to ask again the question  Why leave women's health to chance  And this is a question that haunts those of us in science and medicine who believe that we are on the verge  of being able to dramatically improve the health of women. We know that every cell has a sex. We know that these differences  are often overlooked. And therefore we know that women  are not getting the full benefit of modern science and medicine today. We have the tools but we lack the collective will and momentum. Women's health is an equal rights issue as important as equal pay. And it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine. So imagine the momentum we could achieve in advancing the health of women if we considered whether these  sex differences were present at the very beginning of designing research. Or if we analyzed our data by sex. So  people often ask me  What can I do  And here's what I suggest  First  I suggest that you think about women's health in the same way that you think and care about other  causes that are important to you. And second  and equally as important  that as a woman  you have to ask your doctor and the doctors who are caring  for those who you love  Is this disease or treatment different in women  Now  this is a profound question  because the answer is likely yes  but your doctor may not know  the answer  at least not yet. But if you ask the question   your doctor will very likely go looking for the answer. And this is so important  not only for ourselves  but for all of those whom we love. Whether it be a mother  a daughter  a sister  a friend or a grandmother. It was my grandmother's suffering that inspired my work to improve the health of women. That's her legacy. Our legacy can be to improve the health of women for this generation and for generations to come. Thank you. I have spent the last years trying to resolve two enigmas  Why is productivity so disappointing in all the companies where I work  I have worked with more than     companies. Despite all the technological advances    computers  I.T.  communications  telecommunications  the Internet. Enigma number two  Why is there so little engagement at work  Why do people feel so miserable  even actively disengaged  Disengaging their colleagues. Acting against the interest of their company. Despite all the affiliation events  the celebration  the people initiatives  the leadership development programs to train managers on how to better motivate their teams. At the beginning  I thought there was a chicken and egg issue  Because people are less engaged   they are less productive. Or vice versa  because they are less productive  we put more pressure and they are less engaged. But as we were doing our analysis we realized that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates  in fact  to the basic  pillars of management. The way we organize is based on two pillars. The hard    structure  processes  systems. The soft    feelings  sentiments  interpersonal relationships  traits  personality. And whenever a company reorganizes  restructures  reengineers  goes through a cultural transformation program  it chooses these two pillars. Now  we try to refine them  we try to combine them. The real issue is    and this is the answer to the two enigmas    these pillars are obsolete. Everything you read in business books is based either on one or the other or their combination. They are obsolete. How do they work when you try to use these approaches in front of the new complexity of business  The hard approach  basically  is that you start from strategy  requirements  structures  processes   systems  KPIs  scorecards  committees  headquarters  hubs  clusters  you name it. I forgot all the metrics  incentives  committees   middle offices and interfaces. What happens basically on the left  you have more complexity  the  new complexity of business. We need quality  cost  reliability  speed. And every time there is a new requirement  we use the same approach. We create dedicated structure processed systems  basically to deal with the  new complexity of business. The hard approach creates just complicatedness in the organization. Let's take an example. An automotive company  the engineering division is a five dimensional matrix. If you open any cell of the matrix  you find another    dimensional matrix. You have Mr. Noise  Mr. Petrol Consumption  Mr. Anti Collision Properties. For any new requirement  you have a dedicated function in charge of aligning engineers against the new requirement. What happens when the new  requirement emerges  Some years ago  a new requirement appeared on the marketplace  the length of the warranty period. So therefore the new requirement is repairability  making cars easy to repair. Otherwise when you bring the car  to the garage to fix the light  if you have to remove the engine to access the lights  the car will have to stay one week in the garage instead of two hours  and the  warranty budget will explode. So  what was the solution using the hard approach  If repairability is the new requirement  the solution is to create a new function  Mr. Repairability. And Mr. Repairability creates  the repairability process. With a repairability scorecard   with a repairability metric and eventually repairability incentive. That came on top of    other KPIs. What percentage of these people is variable compensation  Twenty percent at most  divided by    KPIs  repairability makes a difference of  .  percent. What difference did it make in their actions  their choices to simplify  Zero. But what occurs for zero impact   Mr. Repairability  process  scorecard  evaluation  coordination  with the    other coordinators to have zero impact. Now  in front of the new complexity of business  the only solution is not drawing boxes with reporting lines. It is basically the interplay. How the parts work together. The connections  the interactions  the synapses. It is not the skeleton of boxes   it is the nervous system of adaptiveness and intelligence. You know  you could call it cooperation  basically. Whenever people cooperate  they use less resources. In everything. You know  the repairability issue is a cooperation problem. When you design cars  please take into account the needs of those who will repair the cars in the after sales garages. When we don't cooperate we need more time  more equipment  more systems  more teams. We need    When procurement  supply  chain  manufacturing don't cooperate we need more stock  more inventories   more working capital. Who will pay for that  Shareholders  Customers  No  they will refuse. So who is left   The employees  who have to compensate through their super individual efforts for the lack of cooperation. Stress  burnout  they are  overwhelmed  accidents. No wonder they disengage. How do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation  The hard  In banks  when there is a problem between the back office and the front office  they don't cooperate. What is the solution  They create a middle office. What happens one year later  Instead of one problem  between the back and the front  now I have two problems. Between the back and the middle and between the middle and the front. Plus I have to pay for the middle office. The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation. It can only add new boxes   new bones in the skeleton. The soft approach  To make people cooperate  we need  to make them like each other. Improve interpersonal feelings  the more people like each other   the more they will cooperate. It is totally wrong. It is even counterproductive. Look  at home I have two TVs. Why  Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife. Not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife. And why I try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife is precisely because I love my wife. If I didn't love my wife  one TV would be enough  You will watch my favorite football game  if you are not happy  how is the book or the door  The more we like each other  the more we avoid the real cooperation that would strain our relationships  by imposing tough tradeoffs. And we go for a second TV or we escalate the decision above for arbitration. Definitely  these approaches are obsolete. To deal with complexity  to enhance the nervous system  we have created what we call  the smart simplicity approach based on simple rules. Simple rule number one  Understand what others do. What is their real work  We need to go beyond the boxes  the job descriptions  beyond the surface of the container  to understand the real content. Me  designer  if I put a wire here  I know that it will mean that we will have to remove the engine to access the lights. Second  you need to reenforce integrators. Integrators are not middle  offices  they are managers  existing managers that you reinforce so that they have power and interest to make others cooperate. How can you reinforce your  managers as integrators  By removing layers. When there are too many layers people are too far from the action  therefore they need KPIs  metrics  they need poor proxies for reality. They don't understand reality and they add the complicatedness of metrics  KPIs. By removing rules    the bigger we are  the more we need integrators  therefore the less rules we must have  to give discretionary power to managers. And we do the opposite    the bigger we are  the more rules we create. And we end up with the Encyclopedia  Britannica of rules. You need to increase the quanitity of power so that you can empower everybody to use their judgment  their intelligence. You must give more cards to people so that they have the critical mass of cards to take the risk to cooperate  to move out of insulation. Otherwise  they will withdraw. They will disengage. These rules  they come from game theory and organizational sociology. You can increase the shadow of the future. Create feedback loops that expose people to the consequences of their actions. This is what the automotive company did when they saw that Mr. Repairability had no impact. They said to the design engineers  Now  in three years  when the new  car is launched on the market  you will move to the after sales  network  and become in charge of the warranty budget  and if the warranty budget explodes  it will explode in your face.  Laughter  Much more powerful than  .   percent variable compensation. You need also to increase reciprocity  by removing the buffers that make us self sufficient. When you remove these buffers  you hold me by the nose  I hold you by the ear. We will cooperate. Remove the second TV. There are many second TVs at work that don't create value  they just provide dysfunctional self sufficiency. You need to reward those who cooperate and blame those who don't cooperate. The CEO of The Lego Group  Jorgen Vig Knudstorp  has a great way to use it. He says  blame is not for failure  it is for failing to help or ask for help. It changes everything. Suddenly it becomes in my interest to be transparent on my real weaknesses  my real forecast  because I know I will not be blamed if I fail  but if I fail to help or ask for help. When you do this  it has a lot of implications on organizational design. You stop drawing boxes  dotted lines  full lines  you look at their interplay. It has a lot of implications on financial policies that we use. On human resource management practices. When you do that  you can manage complexity  the new complexity of business  without getting complicated. You create more value with lower cost. You simultaneously improve  performance and satisfaction at work because you have removed the common root cause that hinders both. Complicatedness  This is your  battle  business leaders. The real battle is not against competitors. This is rubbish  very abstract. When do we meet competitors to fight them  The real battle is against ourselves  against our bureaucracy  our complicatedness. Only you can fight  can do it. Thank you. Joe Kowan  I have stage fright. I've always had stage fright  and not just a little bit  it's a big bit. And it didn't even matter until I was   . That's when I started writing songs  and even then I only played them for myself. Just knowing my roommates were in the  same house made me uncomfortable. But after a couple of years   just writing songs wasn't enough. I had all these stories and ideas  and I wanted to share them with people  but physiologically  I couldn't do it. I had this irrational fear. But the more I wrote  and the more I practiced  the more I wanted to perform. So on the week of my   th birthday  I decided I was going to go to this local open mic  and put this fear behind me. Well  when I got there  it was packed. There were like    people there. And they all looked angry. But I took a deep breath  and I signed up to play  and I felt pretty good. Pretty good  until about    minutes before my turn  when my whole body rebelled  and  this wave of anxiety just washed over me. Now  when you experience fear   your sympathetic nervous system kicks in. So you have a rush of adrenaline   your heart rate increases  your breathing gets faster. Next your non essential systems start  to shut down  like digestion.  Laughter  So your mouth gets dry  and blood is routed away from your extremities  so your fingers don't work anymore. Your pupils dilate  your muscles contract  your Spidey sense tingles  basically your whole body is trigger happy.  Laughter  That condition is not conducive  to performing folk music. I mean  your nervous system is an idiot. Really  Two hundred thousand years of human evolution  and it still can't tell the difference between a saber tooth tiger and    folksingers on a Tuesday night open mic  I have never been more terrified    until now. So then it was my turn  and somehow  I get myself onto  the stage  I start my song  I open my mouth to sing the first line  and this completely horrible vibrato    you know  when your voice wavers     comes streaming out. And this is not the good kind of vibrato   like an opera singer has  this is my whole body just convulsing with fear. I mean  it's a nightmare. I'm embarrassed  the audience  is clearly uncomfortable  they're focused on my discomfort. It was so bad. But that was my first real experience  as a solo singer songwriter. And something good did happen    I had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that I was hoping for. And I wanted more. But I knew  I had to get past this nervousness. That night I promised myself   I would go back every week until I wasn't nervous anymore. And I did. I went back every single week  and sure enough  week after week  it didn't get any better. The same  thing happened every week.  Laughter  I couldn't shake it. And that's when I had an epiphany. And I remember it really well  because I  don't have a lot of epiphanies.  Laughter  All I had to do was write a song  that exploits my nervousness. That only seems authentic when I have stage fright  and the more nervous I was  the better the song would be. Easy. So I started writing a song about having stage fright. First  fessing up to the problem  the physical manifestations  how I would feel  how the listener might feel. And then accounting for things like my shaky voice  and I knew I would be singing about a  half octave higher than normal  because I was nervous. By having a song that explained  what was happening to me  while it was happening  that gave the audience permission to think about it. They didn't have to feel bad  for me because I was nervous  they could experience that with me  and we were all one big happy  nervous   uncomfortable family.  Laughter  By thinking about my audience   by embracing and exploiting my problem  I was able to take something  that was blocking my progress  and turn it into something that  was essential for my success. And having the stage fright song let  me get past that biggest issue right in the beginning of a performance. And then I could move on   and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease. And eventually  over time  I didn't  have to play the stage fright song at all. Except for when I was really  nervous  like now.  Laughter  Would it be okay if I played the  stage fright song for you  Can I have a sip of water  Thank you.   I'm not joking  you know      this stage fright is real.     And if I'm up here trembling and singing      well  you'll know how I feel.     And the mistake I'd be making      the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking.     As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me      well  you don't have to be.     Well  maybe just a little bit.     And maybe I'll try to imagine  you all without clothes.     But singing in front of all naked strangers scares me more than anyone knows.     Not to discuss this at length      but my body image was never my strength.     So frankly  I wish that you all would get dressed      I mean  you're not even really naked.     And I'm the one with the problem.     And you tell me  don't worry  so much  you'll be great.     But I'm the one living with me     and I know how I get.     Your advice is gentle but late.     If not just a bit patronizing.     And that sarcastic tone doesn't  help me when I sing.     But we shouldn't talk about  these things right now      really  I'm up on stage  and  you're in the crowd. Hi.     And I'm not making fun of  unnurtured  irrational fear      and if I wasn't ready to face this      I sure as hell wouldn't be here.     But if I belt one note out clearly      you'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely.     And maybe next week  I'll set my guitar ringin'     my voice clear as water  and everyone singin'.     But probably I'll just get up and start groovin'      my vocal cords movin'      at speeds slightly faster than sound.   I'd like to reimagine education. The last year has seen the invention of a new four letter word. It starts with an M. MOOC  massive open online courses. Many organizations are offering these online courses to students all over the world  in the millions  for free. Anybody who has an Internet connection and the will to learn can access these great courses from excellent universities and get a credential at the end of it. Now  in this discussion today  I'm going to focus on a different aspect of MOOCs. We are taking what we are learning and the technologies we are developing in the large and applying them in the small to create a blended model of education to really reinvent and reimagine what we do in the classroom. Now  our classrooms could use change. So  here's a classroom at this little three letter institute in the Northeast of America  MIT. And this was a classroom about    or    years ago  and this is a classroom today. What's changed  The seats are in color. Whoop de do. Education really hasn't changed in the past     years. The last big innovation in education was the printing press and the textbooks. Everything else has changed around us. You know  from healthcare to transportation  everything is different  but education hasn't changed. It's also been a real issue in terms of access. So what you see here is not a rock concert. And the person you see at the end of the stage is not Madonna. This is a classroom at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria. Now  we've all heard of distance education  but the students way in the back      feet away from the instructor  I think they are undergoing long distance education. Now  I really believe that we can transform education  both in quality and scale and access  through technology. For example  at edX  we are trying to transform education through online technologies. Given education has been calcified for     years  we really cannot think about reengineering it  micromanaging it. We really have to completely reimagine it. It's like going from ox carts to the airplane. Even the infrastructure has to change. Everything has to change. We need to go from lectures on the blackboard to online exercises  online videos. We have to go to interactive virtual laboratories and gamification. We have to go to completely online grading and peer interaction and discussion boards. Everything really has to change. So at edX and a number of other organizations  we are applying these technologies to education through MOOCs to really increase access to education. And you heard of this example  where  when we launched our very first course    and this was an MIT hard circuits and electronics course    about a year and a half ago          students from     countries enrolled in this course. And we had no marketing budget. Now          is a big number. This number is bigger than the total number of alumni of MIT in its     year history.       students passed the course  and this was a hard course.       is also a big number. If I were to teach at MIT two semesters every year  I would have to teach for    years before I could teach this many students. Now these large numbers are just one part of the story. So today  I want to discuss a different aspect  the other side of MOOCs  take a different perspective. We are taking what we develop and learn in the large and applying it in the small to the classroom  to create a blended model of learning. But before I go into that  let me tell you a story. When my daughter turned     became a teenager  she stopped speaking English  and she began speaking this new language. I call it teen lish. It's a digital language. It's got two sounds  a grunt and a silence.  Honey  come over for dinner.   Hmm.   Did you hear me   Silence.  Laughter   Can you listen to me    quot Hmm. quot  So we had a real issue with communicating  and we were just not communicating  until one day I had this epiphany. I texted her.  Laughter  I got an instant response. I said  no  that must have been by accident. She must have thought  you know  some friend of hers was calling her. So I texted her again. Boom  another response. I said  this is great. And so since then  our life has changed. I text her  she responds. It's just been absolutely great. So our millennial generation is built differently. Now  I'm older  and my youthful looks might belie that  but I'm not in the millennial generation. But our kids are really different. The millennial generation is completely comfortable with online technology. So why are we fighting it in the classroom  Let's not fight it. Let's embrace it. In fact  I believe    and I have two fat thumbs  I can't text very well    but I'm willing to bet that with evolution  our kids and their grandchildren will develop really  really little  itty bitty thumbs to text much better  that evolution will fix all of that stuff. But what if we embraced technology  embraced the millennial generation's natural predilections  and really think about creating these online technologies  blend them into their lives. So here's what we can do. So rather than driving our kids into a classroom  herding them out there at   o'clock in the morning    I hated going to class at   o'clock in the morning  so why are we forcing our kids to do that  So instead what you do is you have them watch videos and do interactive exercises in the comfort of their dorm rooms  in their bedroom  in the dining room  in the bathroom  wherever they're most creative. Then they come into the classroom for some in person interaction. They can have discussions amongst themselves. They can solve problems together. They can work with the professor and have the professor answer their questions. In fact  with edX  when we were teaching our first course on circuits and electronics around the world  this was happening unbeknownst to us. Two high school teachers at the Sant High School in Mongolia had flipped their classroom  and they were using our video lectures and interactive exercises  where the learners in the high school     year olds  mind you  would go and do these things in their own homes and they would come into class  and as you see from this image here  they would interact with each other and do some physical laboratory work. And the only way we discovered this was they wrote a blog and we happened to stumble upon that blog. We were also doing other pilots. So we did a pilot experimental blended courses  working with San Jose State University in California  again  with the circuits and electronics course. You'll hear that a lot. That course has become sort of like our petri dish of learning. So there  the students would  again  the instructors flipped the classroom  blended online and in person  and the results were staggering. Now don't take these results to the bank just yet. Just wait a little bit longer as we experiment with this some more  but the early results are incredible. So traditionally  semester upon semester  for the past several years  this course  again  a hard course  had a failure rate of about    to    percent every semester. With this blended class late last year  the failure rate fell to nine percent. So the results can be extremely  extremely good. Now before we go too far into this  I'd like to spend some time discussing some key ideas. What are some key ideas that makes all of this work  One idea is active learning. The idea here is  rather than have students walk into class and watch lectures  we replace this with what we call lessons. Lessons are interleaved sequences of videos and interactive exercises. So a student might watch a five   seven minute video and follow that with an interactive exercise. Think of this as the ultimate Socratization of education. You teach by asking questions. And this is a form of learning called active learning  and really promoted by a very early paper  in       by Craik and Lockhart  where they said and discovered that learning and retention really relates strongly to the depth of mental processing. Students learn much better when they are interacting with the material. The second idea is self pacing. Now  when I went to a lecture hall  and if you were like me  by the fifth minute I would lose the professor. I wasn't all that smart  and I would be scrambling  taking notes  and then I would lose the lecture for the rest of the hour. Instead  wouldn't it be nice with online technologies  we offer videos and interactive engagements to students  They can hit the pause button. They can rewind the professor. Heck  they can even mute the professor. So this form of self pacing can be very helpful to learning. The third idea that we have is instant feedback. With instant feedback  the computer grades exercises. I mean  how else do you teach         students  Your computer is grading all the exercises. And we've all submitted homeworks  and your grades come back two weeks later  you've forgotten all about it. I don't think I've still received some of my homeworks from my undergraduate days. Some are never graded. So with instant feedback  students can try to apply answers. If they get it wrong  they can get instant feedback. They can try it again and try it again  and this really becomes much more engaging. They get the instant feedback  and this little green check mark that you see here is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX. Learners are telling us that they go to bed at night dreaming of the green check mark. In fact  one of our learners who took the circuits course early last year  he then went on to take a software course from Berkeley at the end of the year  and this is what the learner had to say on our discussion board when he just started that course about the green check mark   quot Oh god  have I missed you. quot  When's the last time you've seen students posting comments like this about homework  My colleague Ed Bertschinger  who heads up the physics department at MIT  has this to say about instant feedback  He indicated that instant feedback turns teaching moments into learning outcomes. The next big idea is gamification. You know  all learners engage really well with interactive videos and so on. You know  they would sit down and shoot alien spaceships all day long until they get it. So we applied these gamification techniques to learning  and we can build these online laboratories. How do you teach creativity  How do you teach design  We can do this through online labs and use computing power to build these online labs. So as this little video shows here  you can engage students much like they design with Legos. So here  the learners are building a circuit with Lego like ease. And this can also be graded by the computer. Fifth is peer learning. So here  we use discussion forums and discussions and Facebook like interaction not as a distraction  but to really help students learn. Let me tell you a story. When we did our circuits course for the         students  I didn't sleep for three nights leading up to the launch of the course. I told my TAs  okay        we're going to be up monitoring the forum  answering questions. They had answered questions for     students. How do you do that for          So one night I'm sitting up there  at   a.m. at night  and I think there's this question from a student from Pakistan  and he asked a question  and I said  okay  let me go and type up an answer  I don't type all that fast  and I begin typing up the answer  and before I can finish  another student from Egypt popped in with an answer  not quite right  so I'm fixing the answer  and before I can finish  a student from the U.S. had popped in with a different answer. And then I sat back  fascinated. Boom  boom  boom  boom  the students were discussing and interacting with each other  and by   a.m. that night  I'm totally fascinated  having this epiphany  and by   a.m. in the morning  they had discovered the right answer. And all I had to do was go and bless it   Good answer.  So this is absolutely amazing  where students are learning from each other  and they're telling us that they are learning by teaching. Now this is all not just in the future. This is happening today. So we are applying these blended learning pilots in a number of universities and  high schools around the world  from Tsinghua in China to the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia to Berkeley in California    all over the world. And these kinds of technologies really help  the blended model can really help revolutionize education. It can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs  the business aspect. We can also license these MOOC courses to other universities  and therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs  where the university that licenses it with the professor can use these online courses like the next generation textbook. They can use as much or as little as they like  and it becomes a tool in the teacher's arsenal. Finally  I would like to have you dream with me for a little bit. I would like us to really reimagine education. We will have to move from lecture halls to e spaces. We have to move from books to tablets like the Aakash in India or the Raspberry Pi     dollars. The Aakash is    dollars. We have to move from bricks and mortar school buildings to digital dormitories. But I think at the end of the day  I think we will still need one lecture hall in our universities. Otherwise  how else do we tell our grandchildren that your grandparents sat in that room in neat little rows like cornstalks and watched this professor at the end talk about content and  you know  you didn't even have a rewind button  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  In       I became the attorney general of the state of New Jersey. Before that  I'd been a criminal prosecutor  first in the Manhattan district attorney's office  and then at the United States Department of Justice. But when I became the attorney general  two things happened that changed  the way I see criminal justice. The first is that I asked what I thought were really basic questions. I wanted to understand who we were arresting  who we were charging  and who we were putting in our nation's jails and prisons. I also wanted to understand if we were making decisions in a way that made us safer. And I couldn't get this information out. It turned out that most big criminal justice agencies like my own didn't track the things that matter. So after about a month of being incredibly frustrated  I walked down into a conference room that was filled with detectives and stacks and stacks of case files  and the detectives were sitting there with yellow legal pads taking notes. They were trying to get the information I was looking for by going through case by case for the past five years. And as you can imagine  when we finally got the results  they weren't good. It turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office in Trenton. The second thing that happened is that I spent the day in the Camden  New Jersey police department. Now  at that time  Camden  New Jersey  was the most dangerous city in America. I ran the Camden Police Department because of that. I spent the day in the police department  and I was taken into a room with senior police officials  all of whom were working hard and trying very hard to reduce crime in Camden. And what I saw in that room  as we talked about how to reduce crime  were a series of officers with a lot of little yellow sticky notes. And they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on a board. And one of them said    We had a robbery two weeks ago. We have no suspects.  And another said   We had a shooting in this neighborhood last week. We have no suspects.  We weren't using data driven policing. We were essentially trying to fight crime with yellow Post it notes. Now  both of these things made me realize fundamentally that we were failing. We didn't even know who was in our criminal justice system  we didn't have any data about the things that mattered  and we didn't share data or use analytics or tools to help us make better decisions and to reduce crime. And for the first time  I started to think about how we made decisions. When I was an assistant D.A.  and when I was a federal prosecutor  I looked at the cases in front of me  and I generally made decisions based on my instinct and my experience. When I became attorney general  I could look at the system as a whole  and what surprised me is that I found that that was exactly how we were doing it across the entire system    in police departments  in prosecutors's offices  in courts and in jails. And what I learned very quickly is that we weren't doing a good job. So I wanted to do things differently. I wanted to introduce data and analytics and rigorous statistical analysis into our work. In short  I wanted to moneyball criminal justice. Now  moneyball  as many of you know  is what the Oakland A's did  where they used smart data and statistics to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games  and they went from a system that  was based on baseball scouts who used to go out and watch players and use their instinct and experience  the scouts' instincts and experience  to pick players  from one to use smart data and rigorous statistical analysis to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games. It worked for the Oakland A's  and it worked in the state of New Jersey. We took Camden off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in America. We reduced murders there by    percent  which actually means    lives were saved. And we reduced all crime in the city by    percent. We also changed the way we did criminal prosecutions. So we went from doing low level drug crimes that were outside our building to doing cases of statewide importance  on things like reducing violence with the most violent offenders  prosecuting street gangs  gun and drug trafficking  and political corruption. And all of this matters greatly  because public safety to me is the most important function of government. If we're not safe  we can't be educated  we can't be healthy  we can't do any of the other things we want to do in our lives. And we live in a country today where we face serious criminal justice problems. We have    million arrests every single year. The vast majority of those arrests are for low level crimes  like misdemeanors     to    percent. Less than five percent of all arrests are for violent crime. Yet we spend    billion  that's b for billion  dollars a year on state and local corrections costs. Right now  today  we have  .  million people in our jails and prisons. And we face unbelievable public safety challenges because we have a situation in which two thirds of the people in our jails are there waiting for trial. They haven't yet been convicted of a crime. They're just waiting for their day in court. And    percent of people come back. Our recidivism rate is amongst  the highest in the world. Almost seven in    people who are released from prison will be rearrested in a constant cycle of crime and incarceration. So when I started my job at the Arnold Foundation  I came back to looking at a lot of these questions  and I came back to thinking about how we had used data and analytics to transform the way we did criminal justice in New Jersey. And when I look at the criminal justice system in the United States today  I feel the exact same way that I did about the state of New Jersey when I started there  which is that we absolutely have to do better  and I know that we can do better. So I decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make the most critical decision in public safety  and that decision is the determination of whether  when someone has been arrested  whether they pose a risk to public safety and should be detained  or whether they don't pose a risk to public safety and should be released. Everything that happens in criminal cases comes out of this one decision. It impacts everything. It impacts sentencing. It impacts whether someone gets drug treatment. It impacts crime and violence. And when I talk to judges around the United States  which I do all the time now  they all say the same thing  which is that we put dangerous people in jail  and we let non dangerous  nonviolent people out. They mean it and they believe it. But when you start to look at the data  which  by the way  the judges don't have  when we start to look at the data  what we find time and time again  is that this isn't the case. We find low risk offenders  which makes up    percent of our entire criminal justice population  we find that they're in jail. Take Leslie Chew  who was a Texas man who stole four blankets on a cold winter night. He was arrested  and he was kept in jail on       dollars bail  an amount that he could not afford to pay. And he stayed in jail for eight months until his case came up for trial  at a cost to taxpayers of more than       dollars. And at the other end of the spectrum  we're doing an equally terrible job. The people who we find are the highest risk offenders  the people who we think have the highest likelihood of committing a new crime if they're released  we see nationally that    percent of those people are being released. The reason for this is the way we make decisions. Judges have the best intentions when they make these decisions about risk  but they're making them subjectively. They're like the baseball scouts    years ago who were using their instinct and their experience to try to decide what risk someone poses. They're being subjective  and we know what happens with subjective decision making  which is that we are often wrong. What we need in this space are strong data and analytics. What I decided to look for was a strong data and analytic risk assessment tool  something that would let judges actually understand with a scientific and objective way what the risk was that was posed by someone in front of them. I looked all over the country  and I found that between five and    percent of all U.S. jurisdictions actually use any type of risk assessment tool  and when I looked at these tools  I quickly realized why. They were unbelievably expensive to administer  they were time consuming  they were limited to the local jurisdiction in which they'd been created. So basically  they couldn't be scaled or transferred to other places. So I went out and built a phenomenal team of data scientists and researchers and statisticians to build a universal risk assessment tool  so that every single judge in the United States of America can have an objective  scientific measure of risk. In the tool that we've built  what we did was we collected  .  million cases from all around the United States  from cities  from counties  from every single state in the country  the federal districts. And with those  .  million cases  which is the largest data set on pretrial in the United States today  we were able to basically find that there were     plus risk factors that we could look at to try to figure out what mattered most. And we found that there were nine specific things that mattered all across the country and that were the most highly predictive of risk. And so we built a universal risk assessment tool. And it looks like this. As you'll see  we put some information in  but most of it is incredibly simple  it's easy to use  it focuses on things like the defendant's prior convictions  whether they've been sentenced to incarceration  whether they've engaged in violence before  whether they've even failed to come back to court. And with this tool  we can predict three things. First  whether or not someone will commit a new crime if they're released. Second  for the first time  and I think this is incredibly important  we can predict whether someone will commit an act of violence if they're released. And that's the single most important thing that judges say when you talk to them. And third  we can predict whether someone will come back to court. And every single judge in the United States of America can use it  because it's been created on a universal data set. What judges see if they run the risk assessment tool is this    it's a dashboard. At the top  you see the New Criminal Activity Score  six of course being the highest  and then in the middle you see   Elevated risk of violence.  What that says is that this person is someone who has an elevated risk of violence that the judge should look twice at. And then  towards the bottom  you see the Failure to Appear Score  which again is the likelihood that someone will come back to court. Now I want to say something really important. It's not that I think we should be eliminating the judge's instinct and experience from this process. I don't. I actually believe the problem that we see and the reason that we have these incredible system errors  where we're incarcerating low level  nonviolent people and we're releasing high risk  dangerous people  is that we don't have an objective measure of risk. But what I believe should happen is that we should take that data driven risk assessment and combine that with the judge's instinct and experience to lead us to better decision making. The tool went statewide in Kentucky on July    and we're about to go up in a number of other U.S. jurisdictions. Our goal  quite simply  is that every single judge in the United States will use a data driven risk tool within the next five years. We're now working on risk tools for prosecutors and for police officers as well  to try to take a system that runs today in America the same way it did    years ago  based on instinct and experience  and make it into one that runs on data and analytics. Now  the great news about all this  and we have a ton of work left to do  and we have a lot of culture to change  but the great news about all of it is that we know it works. It's why Google is Google  and it's why all these baseball teams use moneyball to win games. The great news for us as well is that it's the way that we can transform the American criminal justice system. It's how we can make our streets safer  we can reduce our prison costs  and we can make our system much fairer and more just. Some people call it data science. I call it moneyballing criminal justice. Thank you. I'm McKenna Pope. I'm    years old  and when I was     I convinced one of the largest toy companies  toymakers  in the world  Hasbro  to change the way that they marketed one of their most best selling products. So allow me to tell you about it. So I have a brother  Gavin. When this whole shebang happened  he was four. He loved to cook. He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these  needless to say  uneatable concoctions  or making invisible macaroni and cheese. He wanted to be a chef really badly. And so what better gift for a kid who wanted to be a chef than an Easy Bake Oven. Right  I mean  we all had those when we were little. And he wanted one so badly. But then he started to realize something. In the commercials  and on the  boxes for the Easy Bake Ovens  Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls. And the way that they did this was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials  and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens and it would be in bright pink and purple  very gender specific colors to females  right  So it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook  boys aren't. And this discouraged my brother a lot. He thought that he wasn't supposed to want to be a chef  because that was something that girls did. Girls cooked  boys didn't  or so was the message that Hasbro was sending. And this got me thinking  God  I wish there was a way that I could change this  that could I have my voice heard by Hasbro so I could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it. And that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org. Change.org is an online petition sharing platform where you can create a petition and share it across all of these social media networks  through Facebook  through Twitter  through YouTube  through Reddit  through Tumblr  through whatever you can think of. And so I created a petition along with the YouTube video that I added to the petition basically asking Hasbro to change the way that they marketed it  in featuring boys in the commercials  on the boxes  and most of all creating them in less gender specific colors. So this petition started to take off    humongously fast  you have no idea. I was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets and press outlets  and it was amazing. In three weeks  maybe three and a half  I had        signatures on this petition. Thank you. So  needless to say  it was crazy. Eventually  Hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters so they could go and unveil their new Easy Bake Oven product to me in black  silver and blue. It was literally one of the best moments of my life. It was like  quot Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. quot  That thing was amazing. What I didn't realize at the time  however  was that I had become an activist  I could change something  that even as a kid  or maybe  even especially as a kid  my voice mattered  and your voice matters too. I want to let you know it's not going to be easy  and it wasn't easy for me  because I faced a lot of obstacles. People online  and sometimes even in real life  were disrespectful to me and my family  and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time  and it really discouraged me. And actually  I have some examples  because what's better revenge than displaying their idiocy  So  let's see. From user name Liquidsore      interesting user names we have here   quot Disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay. quot  Liquidsore    really  Really  Okay. How about from Whiteboy  AGS   People always need something to  female dog  about.  From Jeffrey Gutierrez   quot OMG  shut up. You just want money and attention. quot  So it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because I thought  people don't care  people think it's a waste of time  and people are going to be disrespectful  to me and my family. It hurt me  and it made me think  what's the point of making change in the future  But then I started to realize something. Haters gonna hate. Come on  say it with me. One  two  three  Haters gonna hate. So let your haters hate  you know what  and make your change  because I know you can. I look out into this crowd  and I see     people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change  and I know that you can  and all of you watching at home can too because you have so much that you  can do and that you believe in  and you can trade it across all these social media  through Facebook  through Twitter  through  YouTube  through Reddit  through Tumblr  through whatever else you can think of. And you can make that change. You can take what you believe in and turn it into a cause and change it. And that spark that you've been  hearing about all day today  you can use that spark that you have within you and turn it into a fire. Thank you. Science  science has allowed us to know so much about the far reaches of the universe  which is at the same time tremendously important and extremely remote  and yet much  much closer  much more directly related to us  there are many things we don't really understand. And one of them is the extraordinary social complexity of the animals around us  and today I want to tell you a few stories of animal complexity. But first  what do we call complexity  What is complex  Well  complex is not complicated. Something complicated comprises many small parts  all different  and each of them has its own precise role in the machinery. On the opposite  a complex system is made of many  many similar parts  and it is their interaction that produces a globally coherent behavior. Complex systems have many interacting parts which behave according to simple  individual rules  and this results in emergent properties. The behavior of the system as a whole cannot be predicted from the individual rules only. As Aristotle wrote  the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. But from Aristotle  let's move onto a more concrete example of complex systems. These are Scottish terriers. In the beginning  the system is disorganized. Then comes a perturbation  milk. Every individual starts pushing in one direction and this is what happens. The pinwheel is an emergent property of the interactions between puppies whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk and therefore to push in a random direction. So it's all about finding the simple rules from which complexity emerges. I call this simplifying complexity  and it's what we do at the chair of systems design at ETH Zurich. We collect data on animal populations  analyze complex patterns  try to explain them. It requires physicists who work with biologists  with mathematicians and computer scientists  and it is their interaction that produces cross boundary competence to solve these problems. So again  the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. In a way  collaboration is another example of a complex system. And you may be asking yourself which side I'm on  biology or physics  In fact  it's a little different  and to explain  I need to tell you a short story about myself. When I was a child  I loved to build stuff  to create complicated machines. So I set out to study electrical engineering and robotics  and my end of studies project was about building a robot called ER      it looked like this  that would collect information from its environment and proceed to follow a white line on the ground. It was very  very complicated  but it worked beautifully in our test room  and on demo day  professors had  assembled to grade the project. So we took ER   to the evaluation room. It turned out  the light in that room was slightly different. The robot's vision system got confused. At the first bend in the line  it left its course  and crashed into a wall. We had spent weeks building it  and all it took to destroy it was a subtle change in the color of the light in the room. That's when I realized that the more complicated you make a machine  the more likely that it will fail due to something absolutely unexpected. And I decided that  in fact  I didn't really want to create complicated stuff. I wanted to understand complexity  the complexity of the world around us and especially in the animal kingdom. Which brings us to bats. Bechstein's bats are a common species of European bats. They are very social animals. Mostly they roost  or sleep  together. And they live in maternity colonies  which means that every spring  the females meet after the winter hibernation  and they stay together for about six months to rear their young  and they all carry a very small chip  which means that every time one of them enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes  we know where she is  and more importantly  we know with whom she is. So I study roosting associations in bats  and this is what it looks like. During the day  the bats roost in a number of sub groups in different boxes. It could be that on one day  the colony is split between two boxes  but on another day  it could be together in a single box  or split between three or more boxes  and that all seems rather erratic  really. It's called fission fusion dynamics  the property for an animal group of regularly splitting and merging into different subgroups. So what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them together to extract a long term association pattern by applying techniques with network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony. Okay  So that's what this picture looks like. In this network  all the circles are nodes  individual bats  and the lines between them are social bonds  associations between individuals. It turns out this is a very interesting picture. This bat colony is organized in two different communities which cannot be predicted from the daily fission fusion dynamics. We call them cryptic social units. Even more interesting  in fact  Every year  around October  the colony splits up  and all bats hibernate separately  but year after year  when the bats come together again in the spring  the communities stay the same. So these bats remember their friends for a really long time. With a brain the size of a peanut  they maintain individualized  long term social bonds  We didn't know that was possible. We knew that primates and elephants and dolphins could do that  but compared to bats  they have huge brains. So how could it be that the bats maintain this complex  stable social structure with such limited cognitive abilities  And this is where complexity brings an answer. To understand this system  we built a computer model of roosting  based on simple  individual rules  and simulated thousands and thousands of days in the virtual bat colony. It's a mathematical model  but it's not complicated. What the model told us is that  in a nutshell  each bat knows a few other colony members as her friends  and is just slightly more likely to roost in a box with them. Simple  individual rules. This is all it takes to explain the social complexity of these bats. But it gets better. Between      and       the colony lost more than two thirds of its members  probably due to the very cold winter. The next spring  it didn't form two communities like every year  which may have led the whole colony to die because it had become too small. Instead  it formed a single  cohesive social unit  which allowed the colony to survive that season and thrive again in the next two years. What we know is that the bats are not aware that their colony is doing this. All they do is follow simple association rules  and from this simplicity emerges social complexity which allows the colony to be resilient against dramatic changes in the population structure. And I find this incredible. Now I want to tell you another story  but for this we have to travel from Europe to the Kalahari Desert in South Africa. This is where meerkats live. I'm sure you know meerkats. They're fascinating creatures. They live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy. There is one dominant pair  and many subordinates  some acting as sentinels  some acting as babysitters  some teaching pups  and so on. What we do is put very small GPS collars on these animals to study how they move together  and what this has to do with their social structure. And there's a very interesting example of collective movement in meerkats. In the middle of the reserve which they live in lies a road. On this road there are cars  so it's dangerous. But the meerkats have to cross it to get from one feeding place to another. So we asked  how exactly do they do this  We found that the dominant female is mostly the one who leads the group to the road  but when it comes to crossing it  crossing the road  she gives way to the subordinates  a manner of saying   Go ahead  tell me if it's safe.  What I didn't know  in fact  was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow for this change at the edge of the group to happen and if simple rules were sufficient to explain it. So I built a model  a model of simulated meerkats crossing a simulated road. It's a simplistic model. Moving meerkats are like random particles whose unique rule is one of alignment. They simply move together. When these particles get to the road  they sense some kind of obstacle  and they bounce against it. The only difference between the dominant female  here in red  and the other individuals  is that for her  the height of the obstacle  which is in fact the risk perceived from the road  is just slightly higher  and this tiny difference in the individual's rule of movement is sufficient to explain what we observe  that the dominant female leads her group to the road and then gives way to the others for them to cross first. George Box  who was an English statistician  once wrote   All models are false  but some models are useful.  And in fact  this model is obviously false  because in reality  meerkats are anything but random particles. But it's also useful  because it tells us that extreme simplicity in movement rules at the individual level can result in a great deal of complexity at the level of the group. So again  that's simplifying complexity. I would like to conclude on what this means for the whole species. When the dominant female gives way to a subordinate  it's not out of courtesy. In fact  the dominant female is extremely important for the cohesion of the group. If she dies on the road  the whole group is at risk. So this behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response. These meerkats are replicating an evolved tactic that is thousands of generations old  and they're adapting it to a modern risk  in this case a road built by humans. They adapt very simple rules  and the resulting complex behavior allows them to resist human encroachment into their natural habitat. In the end  it may be bats which change their social structure in response to a population crash  or it may be meerkats who show a novel adaptation to a human road  or it may be another species. My message here    and it's not a complicated one  but a simple one of wonder and hope    my message here is that animals show extraordinary social complexity  and this allows them to adapt and respond to changes in their environment. In three words  in the animal kingdom  simplicity leads to complexity which leads to resilience. Thank you. Dania Gerhardt  Thank you very much  Nicolas  for this great start. Little bit nervous  Nicolas Perony  I'm okay  thanks. DG  Okay  great. I'm sure a  lot of people in the audience somehow tried to make associations between the animals you were talking about    the bats  meerkats    and humans. You brought some examples  The females are the social ones  the females are the dominant ones  I'm not sure who thinks how. But is it okay to do these associations  Are there stereotypes you can confirm in this regard that can be valid across all species  NP  Well  I would say there are also counter examples to these stereotypes. For examples  in sea horses or in koalas  in fact  it is the males who take care of the young always. And the lesson is that it's often difficult  and sometimes even a bit dangerous  to draw parallels between humans and animals. So that's it. DG  Okay. Thank you very much for this great start.

Maya Penn  I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon  and I've been making animated flip books since I was three years old. At that age  I also learned about what an animator was. There was a program on TV about jobs most kids don't know about. When I understood that an animator makes the cartoons I saw on TV  I immediately said   That's what I want to be.  I don't know if I said it mentally or out loud  but that was a greatly defining moment in my life. Animation and art has always been my first love. It was my love for technology that sparked the idea for  Malicious Dishes.  There was a virus on my computer  and I was trying to get rid of it  and all of a sudden  I just thought  what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer  Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things  And thus   Malicious Dishes  was born. At four years old  my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again. That started my love for technology. I built my first website myself in HTML  and I'm learning JavaScript and Python. I'm also working on an animated series called  The Pollinators.  It's about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why they're so important. If plants aren't pollinated by the pollinators  then all creatures  including ourselves  that depend on these plants  would starve. So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team. Pollinator  Deforestsaurus  I should have known  I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators  Thank you.  Applause  All of my animations start with ideas  but what are ideas  Ideas can spark a movement. Ideas are opportunities and innovation. Ideas truly are what make the world go round. If it wasn't for ideas  we wouldn't be where we are now with technology  medicine  art  culture  and how we even live our lives. At eight years old  I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya's Ideas  and my nonprofit  Maya's Ideas for the Planet. And I make eco friendly clothing and accessories. I'm    now  and although I started my business in       my artistic journey started way before then. I was greatly influenced by art  and I wanted to incorporate it in everything I did  even my business. I would find different fabrics around the house  and say   quot This could be a scarf or a hat  quot  and I had all these ideas for designs. I noticed when I wore my creations  people would stop me and say   Wow  that's really cute. Where can I get one   And I thought  I can start my own business. Now I didn't have any business plans at only eight years old. I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back. My mom taught me how to sew  and on my back porch  I would sit and make little headbands out of ribbon  and I would write down the names and the price of each item. I started making more items like hats  scarves and bags. Soon  my items began selling all over the world  and I had customers in Denmark  Italy  Australia  Canada and more. Now  I had a lot to learn about my business  like branding and marketing  staying engaged with my customers  and seeing what sold the most and the least. Soon  my business really started to take off. Then one day  Forbes magazine  contacted me when I was    years old. They wanted to feature me and my company in their article. Now a lot of people ask me  why is your business eco friendly  I've had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since I was little. My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment. I heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet  so I started doing my own research  and I discovered that even after dyeing has being completed  there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment. For example  the grinding of materials  or the dumping of dried powder materials. These actions can pollute the air  making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it. So when I started my business  I knew two things  All of my items had to be eco friendly  and    to    percent of the profits I made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations. I feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business  but also a sustainable future. I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow. We live in a big  diverse and beautiful world  and that makes me even more passionate to save it. But it's never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world. It takes to get it through your hearts  because when you get it through your heart  that is when movements are sparked. That is when opportunities and innovation are created  and that is why ideas come to life. Thank you  and peace and blessings. Thank you.  Applause  Pat Mitchell  So  you heard Maya talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredible woman. Where are they  Please  Mr. and Mrs. Penn. Would you just    Ah  I want you to imagine what a breakthrough this was for women who were victims of violence in the     s. They would come into the emergency room with what the police would call  a lovers' quarrel   and I would see a woman who was beaten  I would see a broken nose and a fractured wrist and swollen eyes. And as activists  we would take our Polaroid camera  we would take her picture  we would wait    seconds  and we would give her the photograph. And she would then have the evidence she needed to go to court. We were making what was invisible visible. I've been doing this for    years. I've been part of a social movement that has been working on ending violence against women and children. And for all those years  I've had an absolutely passionate and sometimes not popular belief that this violence is not inevitable  that it is learned  and if it's learned  it can be un learned  and it can be prevented. Why do I believe this  Because it's true. It is absolutely true. Between      and       domestic violence among adult women in the United States has gone down by    percent  and that is great news. Sixty four percent. Now  how did we get there  Our eyes were wide open. Thirty years ago  women were beaten  they were stalked  they were raped  and no one talked about it. There was no justice. And as an activist  that was not good enough. And so step one on this journey is we organized  and we created this extraordinary underground network of amazing women who opened shelters  and if they didn't open a shelter  they opened their home so that women and children could be safe. And you know what else we did  We had bake sales  we had car washes  and we did everything we could do to fundraise  and then at one point we said  you know  it's time that we went to the federal government and asked them to pay for these extraordinary services that are saving people's lives. Right   Applause  And so  step number two  we knew we needed to change the laws. And so we went to Washington  and we lobbied for the first piece of legislation. And I remember walking through the halls of the U.S. Capitol  and I was in my   s  and my life had purpose  and I couldn't imagine that anybody would ever challenge this important piece of legislation. I was probably    and naive. But I heard about a congressman who had a very  very different point of view. Do you know what he called this important piece of legislation  He called it the Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act. The Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act. Ladies and gentlemen  that was in      in the United States  and I wish I had Twitter. Ten years later  after lots of hard work  we finally passed the Violence Against Women Act  which is a life changing act that has saved so many lives.  Applause  Thank you. I was proud to be part of that work  and it changed the laws and it put millions of dollars into local communities. And you know what else it did  It collected data. And I have to tell you  I'm passionate about data. In fact  I am a data nerd. I'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here. I am a data nerd  and the reason for that is I want to make sure that if we spend a dollar  that the program works  and if it doesn't work  we should change the plan. And I also want to say one other thing  We are not going to solve this problem by building more jails or by even building more shelters. It is about economic empowerment for women  it is about healing kids who are hurt  and it is about prevention with a capital P. And so  step number three on this journey  We know  if we're going to keep making this progress  we're going to have to turn up the volume  we're going to have to increase the visibility  and we're going to have to engage the public. And so knowing that  we went to the Advertising Council  and we asked them to help us build a public education campaign. And we looked around the world to Canada and Australia and Brazil and parts of Africa  and we took this knowledge and we built the first national public education campaign called There's No Excuse for Domestic Violence. Take a look at one of our spots. Woman  Well  I thought you'd be home a couple hours ago  and I put everything away  so  Man  What is this  Pizza. Woman  If you had just called me  I would have known  Man  Dinner  Dinner ready is a pizza  Woman  Honey  please don't be so loud. Please don't Let go of me  Man  Get in the kitchen  Woman  No  Help  Man  You want to see what hurts   Slaps woman  That's what hurts  That's what hurts   Breaking glass  Woman  Help me    Children have to sit by and watch. What's your excuse    Esta Soler  As we were in the process of releasing this campaign  O.J. Simpson was arrested for the murder of his wife and her friend. We learned that he had a long history of domestic violence. The media became fixated. The story of domestic violence went from the back page  but actually from the no page  to the front page. Our ads blanketed the airwaves  and women  for the first time  started to tell their stories. Movements are about moments  and we seized this moment. And let me just put this in context. Before       do you have any idea how many articles were in The New York Times on domestic violence  I'll tell you     . And in the     s  over      . We were obviously making a difference. But we were still missing a critical element. So  step four  We needed to engage men. We couldn't solve this problem with    percent of the population on the sidelines. And I already told you I'm a data nerd. National polling told us that men felt indicted and not invited into this conversation. So we wondered  how can we include men  How can we get men to talk about violence against women and girls  And a male friend of mine pulled me aside and he said   You want men to talk about violence against women and girls. Men don't talk.  I apologize to the men in the audience. I know you do. But he said   Do you know what they do do  They do talk to their kids. They talk to their kids as parents  as coaches.  And that's what we did. We met men where they were at and we built a program. And then we had this one event that stays in my heart forever where a basketball coach was talking to a room filled with male athletes and men from all walks of life. And he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving men the tools to have healthy relationships. And all of a sudden  he looked at the back of the room  and he saw his daughter  and he called out his daughter's name  Michaela  and he said   Michaela  come up here.  And she's nine years old  and she was kind of shy  and she got up there  and he said   Sit down next to me.  She sat right down next to him. He gave her this big hug  and he said   People ask me why I do this work. I do this work because I'm her dad  and I don't want anyone ever to hurt her.  And as a parent  I get it. I get it  knowing that there are so many sexual assaults on college campuses that are so widespread and so under reported. We've done a lot for adult women. We've got to do a better job for our kids. We just do. We have to.  Applause  We've come a long way since the days of the Polaroid. Technology has been our friend. The mobile phone is a global game changer for the empowerment of women  and Facebook and Twitter and Google and YouTube and all the social media helps us organize and tell our story in a powerful way. And so those of you in this audience who have helped build those applications and those platforms  as an organizer  I say  thank you very much. Really. I clap for you. I'm the daughter of a man who joined one club in his life  the Optimist Club. You can't make that one up. And it is his spirit and his optimism that is in my DNA. I have been doing this work for over    years  and I am convinced  now more than ever  in the capacity of human beings to change. I believe we can bend the arc of human history toward compassion and equality  and I also fundamentally believe and passionately believe that this violence does not have to be part of the human condition. And I ask you  stand with us as we create futures without violence for women and girls and men and boys everywhere. Thank you very much. Five years ago  I was a Ph.D. student living two lives. In one  I used NASA supercomputers to design next generation spacecraft  and in the other I was a data scientist looking for potential smugglers of sensitive nuclear technologies. As a data scientist  I did a lot of analyses  mostly of facilities  industrial facilities around the world. And I was always looking for a better canvas to tie these all together. And one day  I was thinking about how all data has a location  and I realized that the answer had been staring me in the face. Although I was a satellite engineer  I hadn't thought about using satellite imagery in my work. Now  like most of us  I'd been online  I'd see my house  so I thought  I'll hop in there and I'll start looking up some of these facilities. And what I found really surprised me. The pictures that I was finding were years out of date  and because of that  it had relatively little relevance to the work that I was doing today. But I was intrigued. I mean  satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff. There are millions and millions of sensors surrounding us today  but there's still so much we don't know on a daily basis. How much oil is stored in all of China  How much corn is being produced  How many ships are in all of our world's ports  Now  in theory  all of these questions could be answered by imagery  but not if it's old. And if this data was so valuable  then how come I couldn't get my hands on more recent pictures  So the story begins over    years ago with the launch of the first generation of U.S. government photo reconnaissance satellites. And today  there's a handful of the great  great grandchildren of these early Cold War machines which are now operated by private companies and from which the vast majority of satellite imagery that you and I see on a daily basis comes. During this period  launching things into space  just the rocket to get the satellite up there  has cost hundreds of millions of dollars each  and that's created tremendous pressure to launch things infrequently and to make sure that when you do  you cram as much functionality in there as possible. All of this has only made satellites bigger and bigger and bigger and more expensive  now nearly a billion  with a b  dollars per copy. Because they are so expensive  there aren't very many of them. Because there aren't very many of them  the pictures that we see on a daily basis tend to be old. I think a lot of people actually understand this anecdotally  but in order to visualize just how sparsely our planet is collected  some friends and I put together a dataset of the    million pictures that have been gathered by these satellites between      and     . As you can see in blue  huge areas of our world are barely seen  less than once a year  and even the areas that are seen most frequently  those in red  are seen at best once a quarter. Now as aerospace engineering grad students  this chart cried out to us as a challenge. Why do these things have to be so expensive  Does a single satellite really have to cost the equivalent of three     jumbo jets  Wasn't there a way to build a smaller  simpler  new satellite design that could enable more timely imaging  I realize that it does sound a little bit crazy that we were going to go out and just begin designing satellites  but fortunately we had help. In the late     s  a couple of professors proposed a concept for radically reducing the price of putting things in space. This was hitchhiking small satellites alongside much larger satellites. This dropped the cost of putting objects up there by over a factor of      and suddenly we could afford to experiment  to take a little bit of risk  and to realize a lot of innovation. And a new generation of engineers and scientists  mostly out of universities  began launching these very small  breadbox sized satellites called CubeSats. And these were built with electronics obtained from RadioShack instead of Lockheed Martin. Now it was using the lessons learned from these early missions that my friends and I began a series of sketches of our own satellite design. And I can't remember a specific day where we made a conscious decision that we were actually going to go out and build these things  but once we got that idea in our minds of the world as a dataset  of being able to capture millions of data points on a daily basis describing the global economy  of being able to unearth billions of connections between them that had never before been found  it just seemed boring to go work on anything else. And so we moved into a cramped  windowless office in Palo Alto  and began working to take our design from the drawing board into the lab. The first major question we had to tackle was just how big to build this thing. In space  size drives cost  and we had worked with these very small  breadbox sized satellites in school  but as we began to better understand the laws of physics  we found that the quality of pictures those satellites could take was very limited  because the laws of physics dictate that the best picture you can take through a telescope is a function of the diameter of that telescope  and these satellites had a very small  very constrained volume. And we found that the best picture we would have been able to get looked something like this. Although this was the low cost option  quite frankly it was just too blurry to see the things that make satellite imagery valuable. So about three or four weeks later  we met a group of engineers randomly who had worked on the first private imaging satellite ever developed  and they told us that back in the     s  the U.S. government had found a powerful optimal tradeoff    that in taking pictures at right about one meter resolution  being able to see objects one meter in size  they had found that they could not just get very high quality images  but get a lot of them at an affordable price. From our own computer simulations  we quickly found that one meter really was the minimum viable product to be able to see the drivers of our global economy  for the first time  being able to count the ships and cars and shipping containers and trucks that move around our world on a daily basis  while conveniently still not being able to see individuals. We had found our compromise. We would have to build something larger than the original breadbox  now more like a mini fridge  but we still wouldn't have to build a pickup truck. So now we had our constraint. The laws of physics dictated the absolute minimum sized telescope that we could build. What came next was making the rest of the satellite as small and as simple as possible  basically a flying telescope with four walls and a set of electronics smaller than a phone book that used less power than a     watt lightbulb. The big challenge became actually taking the pictures through that telescope. Traditional imaging satellites use a line scanner  similar to a Xerox machine  and as they traverse the Earth  they take pictures  scanning row by row by row to build the complete image. Now people use these because they get a lot of light  which means less of the noise you see in a low cost cell phone image. The problem with them is they require very sophisticated pointing. You have to stay focused on a    centimeter target from over     miles away while moving at more than seven kilometers a second  which requires an awesome degree of complexity. So instead  we turned to a new generation of video sensors  originally created for use in night vision goggles. Instead of taking a single  high quality image  we could take a videostream of individually noisier frames  but then we could recombine all of those frames together into very high quality images using sophisticated pixel processing techniques here on the ground  at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system. And we applied this technique to many of the other systems on the satellite as well  and day by day  our design evolved from CAD to prototypes to production units. A few short weeks ago  we packed up SkySat    put our signatures on it  and waved goodbye for the last time on Earth. Today  it's sitting in its final launch configuration ready to blast off in a few short weeks. And soon  we'll turn our attention to launching a constellation of    or more of these satellites and beginning to build the scalable analytics that will allow us to unearth the insights in the petabytes of data we will collect. So why do all of this  Why build these satellites  Well  it turns out imaging satellites have a unique ability to provide global transparency  and providing that transparency on a timely basis is simply an idea whose time has come. We see ourselves as pioneers of a new frontier  and beyond economic data  unlocking the human story  moment by moment. For a data scientist that just happened to go to space camp as a kid  it just doesn't get much better than that. Thank you. The urban explosion of the last years of economic boom also produced dramatic marginalization  resulting in the explosion of slums in many parts of the world. This polarization of enclaves of mega wealth surrounded by sectors of poverty and the socioeconomic inequalities they have engendered is really at the center of today's urban crisis. But I want to begin tonight by suggesting that this urban crisis is not only economic or environmental. It's particularly a cultural crisis  a crisis of the institutions unable to reimagine the stupid ways which we have been growing  unable to challenge the oil hungry  selfish urbanization that have perpetuated cities based on consumption  from southern California to New York to Dubai. So I just really want to share with you a reflection that the future of cities today depends less on buildings and  in fact  depends more on the fundamental reorganization of socioeconomic relations  that the best ideas in the shaping of the city in the future will not come from enclaves of economic power and abundance  but in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity from which an urgent imagination can really inspire us to rethink urban growth today. And let me illustrate what I mean by understanding or engaging sites of conflict as harboring creativity  as I briefly introduce you to the Tijuana San Diego border region  which has been the laboratory to rethink my practice as an architect. This is the wall  the border wall  that separates San Diego and Tijuana  Latin America and the United States  a physical emblem of exclusionary planning policies that have perpetuated the division of communities  jurisdictions and resources across the world. In this border region  we find some of the wealthiest real estate  as I once found in the edges of San Diego  barely    minutes away from some of the poorest  settlements in Latin America. And while these two cities have the same population  San Diego has grown six times larger than Tijuana in the last decades  immediately thrusting us to confront the tensions and conflicts between sprawl and density  which are at the center of today's discussion about environmental sustainability. So I've been arguing in the last years that  in fact  the slums of Tijuana can teach a lot to the sprawls of San Diego when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability  that we should pay attention and learn from the many migrant communities on both sides of this border wall so that we can translate their informal processes of urbanization. What do I mean by the informal in this case  I'm really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to transgress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization. I'm talking simply about the creative intelligence of the bottom up  whether manifested in the slums of Tijuana that build themselves  in fact  with the waste of San Diego  or the many migrant neighborhoods in Southern California that have begun to be retrofitted with difference in the last decades. So I've been interested as an artist in the measuring  the observation  of many of the trans border informal flows across this border  in one direction  from south to north  the flow of immigrants into the United States  and from north to south the flow of waste from southern California into Tijuana. I'm referring to the recycling of these old post war bungalows that Mexican contractors bring to the border as American developers are disposing of them in the process of building a more inflated version of suburbia in the last decades. So these are houses waiting to cross the border. Not only people cross the border here  but entire chunks of one city move to the next  and when these houses are placed on top of these steel frames  they leave the first floor to become the second to be in filled with more house  with a small business. This layering of spaces and economies is very interesting to notice. But not only houses  also small debris from one city  from San Diego  to Tijuana. Probably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires that are used in the slums to build retaining walls. But look at what people have done here in conditions of socioeconomic emergency. They have figured out how to peel off the tire  how to thread it and interlock it to construct a more efficient retaining wall. Or the garage doors that are brought from San Diego in trucks to become the new skin of emergency housing in many of these slums surrounding the edges of Tijuana. So while  as an architect  this is a very compelling thing to witness  this creative intelligence  I also want to keep myself in check. I don't want to romanticize poverty. I just want to suggest that this informal urbanization is not just the image of precariousness  that informality here  the informal  is really a set of socioeconomic and political procedures that we could translate as artists  that this is about a bottom up urbanization that performs. See here  buildings are not important just for their looks  but  in fact  they are important for what they can do. They truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate the spaces and boundaries and resources. So while waste flows southbound  people go north in search of dollars  and most of my research has had to do with the impact of immigration in the alteration of the homogeneity of many neighborhoods in the United States  particularly in San Diego. And I'm talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of Southern California depends on the retrofitting of the large urbanization    I mean  on steroids    with the small programs  social and economic. I'm referring to how immigrants  when they come to these neighborhoods  they begin to alter the one dimensionality of parcels and properties into more socially and economically complex systems  as they begin to plug an informal economy into a garage  or as they build an illegal granny flat to support an extended family. This socioeconomic entrepreneurship on the ground within these neighborhoods really begins to suggest ways of translating that into new  inclusive and more equitable land use policies. So many stories emerge from these dynamics of alteration of space  such as  quot the informal Buddha  quot  which tells the story of a small house that saved itself  it did not travel to Mexico  but it was retrofitted in the end into a Buddhist temple  and in so doing  this small house transforms or mutates from a singular dwelling into a small  or a micro  socioeconomic and cultural infrastructure inside a neighborhood. So these action neighborhoods  as I call them  really become the inspiration to imagine other interpretations of citizenship that have less to do  in fact  with belonging to the nation state  and more with upholding the notion of citizenship as a creative act that reorganizes institutional protocols in the spaces of the city. As an artist  I've been interested  in fact  in the visualization of citizenship  the gathering of many anecdotes  urban stories  in order to narrativize the relationship between social processes and spaces. This is a story of a group of teenagers that one night  a few months ago  decided to invade this space under the freeway to begin constructing their own skateboard park. With shovels in hand  they started to dig. Two weeks later  the police stopped them. They barricaded the place  and the teenagers were evicted  and the teenagers decided to fight back  not with bank cards or slogans but with constructing a critical process. The first thing they did was to recognize the specificity of political jurisdiction inscribed in that empty space. They found out that they had been lucky because they had not begun to dig under Caltrans territoy. Caltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway  so it would have been very difficult to negotiate with them. They were lucky  they said  because they began to dig under an arm of the freeway that belongs to the local municipality. They were also lucky  they said  because they began to dig in a sort of Bermuda Triangle of jurisdiction  between port authority  airport authority  two city districts  and a review board. All these red lines are the invisible political institutions that were inscribed in that leftover empty space. With this knowledge  these teenagers as skaters confronted the city. They came to the city attorney's office. The city attorney told them that in order to continue the negotiation they had to become an NGO  and of course they didn't know what an NGO was. They had to talk to their friends in Seattle who had gone through the same experience. And they began to realize the necessity to organize themselves even deeper and began to fundraise  to organize budgets  to really be aware of all the knowledge embedded in the urban code in San Diego so that they could begin to redefine the very meaning of public space in the city  expanding it to other categories. At the end  the teenagers won the case with that evidence  and they were able to construct their skateboard park under that freeway. Now for many of you  this story might seem trivial or naive. For me as an architect  it has become a fundamental narrative  because it begins to teach me that this micro community not only designed another category of public space but they also designed the socioeconomic protocols that were necessary to be inscribed in that space for its long term sustainability. They also taught me that similar to the migrant communities on both sides of the border  they engaged conflict itself as a creative tool  because they had to produce a process that enabled them to reorganize resources and the politics of the city. In that act  that informal  bottom up act of transgression  really began to trickle up to transform top down policy. Now this journey from the bottom up to the transformation of the top down is where I find hope today. And I'm thinking of how these modest alterations with space and with policy in many cities in the world  in primarily the urgency of a collective imagination as these communities reimagine their own forms of governance  social organization  and infrastructure  really is at the center of the new formation of democratic politics of the urban. It is  in fact  this that could become the framework for producing new social and economic justice in the city. I want to say this and emphasize it  because this is the only way I see that can enable us to move from urbanizations of consumption to neighborhoods of production today. Thank you. Intelligence    what is it  If we take a look back at the history of how intelligence has been viewed  one seminal example has been Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that  the question of whether a machine can think is about as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim.  Now  Edsger Dijkstra  when he wrote this  intended it as a criticism of the early pioneers of computer science  like Alan Turing. However  if you take a look back and think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build artificial machines that swim and artificial machines that  fly   you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming and flight that we were able to build these machines. And so  several years ago  I undertook a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence. Let's take a step back. Let's first begin with a thought experiment. Pretend that you're an alien race that doesn't know anything about Earth biology or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence  but you have amazing telescopes and you're able to watch the Earth  and you have amazingly long lives  so you're able to watch the Earth over millions  even billions of years. And you observe a really strange effect. You observe that  over the course of the millennia  Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids up until a point  and that at some point  corresponding roughly to our year       AD  asteroids that are on a collision course with the Earth that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get deflected or they detonate before they can hit the Earth. Now of course  as earthlings  we know the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves. We're trying to prevent an impact. But if you're an alien race who doesn't know any of this  doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence  you'd be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how  up until a certain point in time  asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet mysteriously stop doing that. And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence. So in this program that I undertook several years ago  I looked at a variety of different threads across science  across a variety of disciplines  that were pointing  I think  towards a single  underlying mechanism for intelligence. In cosmology  for example  there have been a variety of different threads of evidence that our universe appears to be finely tuned for the development of intelligence  and  in particular  for the development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible futures. In game play  for example  in Go    everyone remembers in      when IBM's Deep Blue beat  Garry Kasparov at chess    fewer people are aware that in the past    years or so  the game of Go  arguably a much more challenging game because it has a much higher branching factor  has also started to succumb to computer game players for the same reason  the best techniques right now for computers playing Go are techniques that try to maximize future options during game play. Finally  in robotic motion planning  there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to take advantage of abilities of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to accomplish complex tasks. And so  taking all of these different threads and putting them together  I asked  starting several years ago  is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different threads  Is there a single equation for intelligence  And the answer  I believe  is yes.   F   T   S    What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an E   mc  for intelligence that I've seen. So what you're seeing here is a statement of correspondence that intelligence is a force  F  that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action. It acts to maximize future freedom of action  or keep options open  with some strength T  with the diversity of possible accessible futures  S  up to some future time horizon  tau. In short  intelligence doesn't like to get trapped. Intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action and keep options open. And so  given this one equation  it's natural to ask  so what can you do with this  How predictive is it  Does it predict human level intelligence  Does it predict artificial intelligence  So I'm going to show you now a video that will  I think  demonstrate some of the amazing applications of just this single equation. has suggested that universes that produce more disorder  or  entropy   over their lifetimes should tend to have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings such as ourselves. But what if that tentative cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence hints at a deeper relationship  What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate with the production of long term entropy  but actually emerges directly from it  To find out  we developed a software engine called Entropica  designed to maximize the production of long term entropy of any system that it finds itself in. Amazingly  Entropica was able to pass multiple animal intelligence tests  play human games  and even earn money trading stocks  all without being instructed to do so. Here are some examples of Entropica in action. Just like a human standing upright without falling over  here we see Entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart. This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave Entropica a goal. It simply decided on its own to balance the pole. This balancing ability will have appliactions for humanoid robotics and human assistive technologies. Just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into narrow spaces  here we see that Entropica  again on its own initiative  was able to move a large disk representing an animal around so as to cause a small disk  representing a tool  to reach into a confined space holding a third disk and release the third disk from its initially fixed position. This tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing and agriculture. In addition  just as some other animals are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release food  here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish a model version of that task. This cooperative ability has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields. Entropica is broadly applicable to a variety of domains. For example  here we see it successfully playing a game of pong against itself  illustrating its potential for gaming. Here we see Entropica orchestrating new connections on a social network where friends are constantly falling out of touch and successfully keeping the network well connected. This same network orchestration ability also has applications in health care  energy  and intelligence. Here we see Entropica directing the paths of a fleet of ships  successfully discovering and utilizing the Panama Canal to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific. By the same token  Entropica is broadly applicable to problems in autonomous defense  logistics and transportation. Finally  here we see Entropica spontaneously discovering and executing a buy low  sell high strategy on a simulated range traded stock  successfully growing assets under management exponentially. This risk management ability will have broad applications in finance and insurance. Alex Wissner Gross  So what you've just seen is that a variety of signature human intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tool use and walking upright and social cooperation all follow from a single equation  which drives a system to maximize its future freedom of action. Now  there's a profound irony here. Going back to the beginning of the usage of the term robot  the play  RUR   there was always a concept that if we developed machine intelligence  there would be a cybernetic revolt. The machines would rise up against us. One major consequence of this work is that maybe all of these decades  we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt in reverse. It's not that machines first become intelligent and then megalomaniacal and try to take over the world. It's quite the opposite  that the urge to take control of all possible futures is a more fundamental principle than that of intelligence  that general intelligence may in fact emerge directly from this sort of control grabbing  rather than vice versa. Another important consequence is goal seeking. I'm often asked  how does the ability to seek goals follow from this sort of framework  And the answer is  the ability to seek goals will follow directly from this in the following sense  just like you would travel through a tunnel  a bottleneck in your future path space  in order to achieve many other diverse objectives later on  or just like you would invest in a financial security  reducing your short term liquidity in order to increase your wealth over the long term  goal seeking emerges directly from a long term drive to increase future freedom of action. Finally  Richard Feynman  famous physicist  once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed and you could pass only a single concept on to our descendants to help them rebuild civilization  that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attract each other when they're far apart but repel each other when they're close together. My equivalent of that statement to pass on to descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence  is the following  Intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future. Thank you very much. Hi. So today  I'd like to share some works in progress. Since we are still realizing these works  we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery  still. So I'm going to try and describe some of the experiences that we're looking for through each of the works. So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes. A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room  and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall. Within seconds  as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer  they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry. So this is the sketch of the two states. One is total chaos. The other is absolute order. And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state. This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions. One is the altar tablets of the   th century  and the other is about     years ago  Malevich's abstract compositions. So I'm just going to take you to a video. To give you a sense of scale  the largest panel is about two meters high. That's about this much.  And the smallest one is an A . So a viewer enters the space  and they snap to attention. And after a while  if the viewer continues to remain in the space  the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again  until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement  when they will again snap to attention. So here it appears as if it's the viewer that's sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels  but it could also be the other way around  that the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant. So this brings me to a quieter  small work called Handheld. The viewer sees a piece of paper that's mounted on the far end of the wall  but when you go closer  you see that it's a blank A   or a letter sized piece of paper  that's held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood. The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly  as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time  and somehow are not managing to. So this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera. So here I'm going to show you two tandem clips. One is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera. And you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view. So we've just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel. So here's a video. You have to imagine the other hand. It's not there yet. But to us  we're sort of trying to evoke a self effacing gesture  as if there's a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper. That sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them. The next work is Decoy. This is a cardboard model  so the object is about as tall as I am. It has a rounded body  two arms  and a very tall  head like antenna  and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself. So when a viewer passes by  it sort of tilts from side to side  and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer. So here is the first test scenario. You see the two movements integrated  and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation. But the idea is that once it's got the person's attention  it's no longer interested  and it looks for the next person whose attention to get. So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy. It appears to be mass manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines. Because we are always working from a very personal space  we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance  at least. And so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention  but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help. The next work is an object  that's also a kind of sound instrument. In the shape of an amphitheater that's scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage. So from where I'm standing  each of you appears to be this big  and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision. Seated in this audience are     small figures. They're mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will. This means that each of them can decide if and when they want to clap  how hard  for how long  how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others  and if they want to contribute to innovation. So when the viewer steps in front of the audience  there will be a response. It could be a few claps or a strong applause  and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage  and again the audience will respond. It could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience  or it could be a very loud ovation. So to us  I think we're really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that's also got a sort of musical like quality to it  an instrument. So the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied  nuanced musical or sound patterns  but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response. So there's a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved. It also has an alluring and trap like quality to it. So here if you see we're quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands. So here's a small visual animation  as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension. And here is a prototype. So we can't wait to be engulfed by     of them. Okay  this is the last work. It's called the Framerunners. It comes out of the idea of a window. This is an actual window in our studio  and as you can see  it's made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections. So we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid that's suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides. This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures. They're also made up of three different sizes  as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain. Each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks. So in contrast to this very tight grid  we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick like quality  as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path. So we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along like they're oblivious and carefree and happy go lucky and content  until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fastest wall. So to us  this work also presents its own contradiction. These figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid  which is like a prison  but also a fortress  because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world. So all these real life qualities that I talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration  and we were very lucky to collaborate with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype. So you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head bobbing movement and the back and forth movement. So it's really quite small. You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand. So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio  and here it is. Thank you. I'd like to start  if I may  with the story of the Paisley snail. On the evening of the   th of August        May Donoghue took a train from Glasgow to the town of Paisley  seven miles east of the city  and there at the Wellmeadow Caf   she had a Scots ice cream float  a mix of ice cream and ginger beer bought for her by a friend. The ginger beer came in a brown  opaque bottle labeled  D. Stevenson  Glen Lane  Paisley.  She drank some of the ice cream float  but as the remaining ginger beer was poured into her tumbler  a decomposed snail floated to the surface of her glass. Three days later  she was admitted to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary and diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis and shock. The case of Donoghue vs. Stevenson that followed set a very important legal precedent  Stevenson  the manufacturer of the ginger beer  was held to have a clear duty of care towards May Donoghue  even though there was no contract between them  and  indeed  she hadn't even bought the drink. One of the judges  Lord Atkin  described it like this  You must take care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbor. Indeed  one wonders that without a duty of care  how many people would have had to suffer from gastroenteritis before Stevenson eventually went out of business. Now please hang on to that Paisley snail story  because it's an important principle. Last year  the Hansard Society  a nonpartisan charity which seeks to strengthen parliamentary democracy and encourage greater public involvement in politics published  alongside their annual audit of political engagement  an additional section devoted entirely to politics and the media. Here are a couple of rather depressing observations from that survey. Tabloid newspapers do not appear to advance the political citizenship of their readers  relative even to those who read no newspapers whatsoever. Tabloid only readers are twice as likely to agree with a negative view of politics than readers of no newspapers. They're not just less politically engaged. They are consuming media that reinforces their negative evaluation of politics  thereby contributing to a fatalistic and cynical attitude to democracy and their own role within it. Little wonder that the report concluded that in this respect  the press  particularly the tabloids  appear not to be living up to the importance of their role in our democracy. Now I doubt if anyone in this room would seriously challenge that view. But if Hansard are right  and they usually are  then we've got a very serious problem on our hands  and it's one that I'd like to spend the next    minutes focusing upon. Since the Paisley snail  and especially over the past decade or so  a great deal of thinking has been developed around the notion of a duty of care as it relates to a number of aspects of civil society. Generally a duty of care arises when one individual or a group of individuals undertakes an activity which has the potential to cause harm to another  either physically  mentally or economically. This is principally focused on obvious areas  such as our empathetic response to children and young people  to our service personnel  and to the elderly and infirm. It is seldom  if ever  extended to equally important arguments around the fragility of our present system of government  to the notion that honesty  accuracy and impartiality are fundamental to the process of building and embedding an informed  participatory democracy. And the more you think about it  the stranger that is. A couple of years ago  I had the pleasure of opening a brand new school in the northeast of England. It had been renamed by its pupils as Academy    . As I walked through their impressive  glass covered atrium  in front of me  emblazoned on the wall in letters of fire was Marcus Aurelius's famous injunction  If it's not true  don't say it  if it's not right  don't do it. The head teacher saw me staring at it  and he said   Oh  that's our school motto.  On the train back to London  I couldn't get it out of my mind. I kept thinking  can it really have taken us over       years to come to terms with that simple notion as being our minimum expectation of each other  Isn't it time that we develop this concept of a duty of care and extended it to include a care for our shared but increasingly endangered democratic values  After all  the absence of a duty of care within many professions can all too easily amount to accusations of negligence  and that being the case  can we be really comfortable with the thought that we're in effect being negligent in respect of the health of our own societies and the values that necessarily underpin them  Could anyone honestly suggest  on the evidence  that the same media which Hansard so roundly condemned have taken sufficient care to avoid behaving in ways which they could reasonably have foreseen would be likely to undermine or even damage our inherently fragile democratic settlement. Now there will be those who will argue that this could all too easily drift into a form of censorship  albeit self censorship  but I don't buy that argument. It has to be possible to balance freedom of expression with wider moral and social responsibilities. Let me explain why by taking the example from my own career as a filmmaker. Throughout that career  I never accepted that a filmmaker should set about putting their own work outside or above what he or she believed to be a decent set of values for their own life  their own family  and the future of the society in which we all live. I'd go further. A responsible filmmaker should never devalue their work to a point at which it becomes less than true to the world they themselves wish to inhabit. As I see it  filmmakers  journalists  even bloggers are all required to face up to the social expectations that come with combining the intrinsic power of their medium with their well honed professional skills. Obviously this is not a mandated duty  but for the gifted filmmaker and the responsible journalist or even blogger  it strikes me as being utterly inescapable. We should always remember that our notion of individual freedom and its partner  creative freedom  is comparatively new in the history of Western ideas  and for that reason  it's often undervalued and can be very quickly undermined. It's a prize easily lost  and once lost  once surrendered  it can prove very  very hard to reclaim. And its first line of defense has to be our own standards  not those enforced on us by a censor or legislation  our own standards and our own integrity. Our integrity as we deal with those with whom we work and our own standards as we operate within society. And these standards of ours need to be all of a piece with a sustainable social agenda. They're part of a collective responsibility  the responsibility of the artist or the journalist to deal with the world as it really is  and this  in turn  must go hand in hand with the responsibility of those governing society to also face up to that world  and not to be tempted to misappropriate the causes of its ills. Yet  as has become strikingly clear over the last couple of years  such responsibility has to a very great extent been abrogated by large sections of the media. And as a consequence  across the Western world  the over simplistic policies of the parties of protest and their appeal to a largely disillusioned  older demographic  along with the apathy and obsession with the trivial that typifies at least some of the young  taken together  these and other similarly contemporary aberrations are threatening to squeeze the life out of active  informed debate and engagement  and I stress active. The most ardent of libertarians might argue that Donoghue v. Stevenson should have been thrown out of court and that Stevenson would eventually have gone out of business if he'd continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it. But most of us  I think  accept some small role for the state to enforce a duty of care  and the key word here is reasonable. Judges must ask  did they take reasonable care and could they have reasonably foreseen the consequences of their actions  Far from signifying overbearing state power  it's that small common sense test of reasonableness that I'd like us to apply to those in the media who  after all  set the tone and the content for much of our democratic discourse. Democracy  in order to work  requires that reasonable men and women take the time to understand and debate difficult  sometimes complex issues  and they do so in an atmosphere which strives for the type of understanding that leads to  if not agreement  then at least a productive and workable compromise. Politics is about choices  and within those choices  politics is about priorities. It's about reconciling conflicting preferences wherever and whenever possibly based on fact. But if the facts themselves are distorted  the resolutions are likely only to create further conflict  with all the stresses and strains on society that inevitably follow. The media have to decide  Do they see their role as being to inflame or to inform  Because in the end  it comes down to a combination of trust and leadership. Fifty years ago this week  President John F. Kennedy made two epoch making speeches  the first on disarmament and the second on civil rights. The first led almost immediately to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty  and the second led to the      Civil Rights Act  both of which represented giant leaps forward. Democracy  well led and well informed  can achieve very great things  but there's a precondition. We have to trust that those making those decisions are acting in the best interest not of themselves but of the whole of the people. We need factually based options  clearly laid out  not those of a few powerful and potentially manipulative corporations pursuing their own frequently narrow agendas  but accurate  unprejudiced information with which to make our own judgments. If we want to provide decent  fulfilling lives for our children and our children's children  we need to exercise to the very greatest degree possible that duty of care for a vibrant  and hopefully a lasting  democracy. Thank you very much for listening to me. So imagine  you're in the supermarket  you're buying some groceries  and you get given the option for a plastic or a paper shopping bag. Which one do you choose if you want to do the right thing by the environment  Most people do pick the paper. Okay  let's think of why. It's brown to start with. Therefore  it must be good for the environment. It's biodegradable. It's reusable. In some cases  it's recyclable. So when people are looking at the plastic bag  it's likely they're thinking of something like this  which we all know is absolutely terrible  and we should be avoiding at all expenses these kinds of environmental damages. But people are often not thinking of something like this  which is the other end of the spectrum. When we produce materials  we need to extract them from the environment  and we need a whole bunch of environmental impacts. You see  what happens is  when we need to make complex choices  us humans like really simple solutions  and so we often ask for simple solutions. And I work in design. I advise designers and innovators around sustainability  and everyone always says to me   Oh Leyla  I just want the eco materials.  And I say   Well  that's very complex  and we'll have to spend four hours talking about what exactly an eco material means  because everything at some point comes from nature  and it's how you use the material that dictates the environmental impact. So what happens is  we have to rely on some sort of intuitive framework when we make decisions. So I like to call that intuitive framework our environmental folklore. It's either the little voice at the back of your head  or it's that gut feeling you get when you've done the right thing  so when you've picked the paper bag or when you've bought a fuel efficient car. And environmental folklore is a really important thing because we're trying to do the right thing. But how do we know if we're actually reducing the net environmental impacts that our actions as individuals and as professionals and as a society are actually having on the natural environment  So the thing about environmental folklore is it tends to be based on our experiences  the things we've heard from other people. It doesn't tend to be based on any scientific framework. And this is really hard  because we live in incredibly complex systems. We have the human systems of how we communicate and interrelate and have our whole constructed society  We have the industrial systems  which is essentially the entire economy  and then all of that has to operate within the biggest system  and  I would argue  the most important  the ecosystem. And you see  the choices that we make as an individual  but the choices that we make in every single job that we have  no matter how high or low you are in the pecking order  has an impact on all of these systems. And the thing is that we have to find ways if we're actually going to address sustainability of interlocking those complex systems and making better choices that result in net environmental gains. What we need to do is we need to learn to do more with less. We have an increasing population  and everybody likes their mobile phones  especially in this situation here. So we need to find innovative ways of solving some of these problems that we face. And that's where this process called life cycle thinking comes in. So essentially  everything that is created goes through a series of life cycle stages  and we use this scientific process called life cycle assessment  or in America  you guys say life cycle analysis  in order to have a clearer picture of how everything that we do in the technical part of those systems affects the natural environment. So we go all the way back to the extraction of raw materials  and then we look at manufacturing  we look at packaging and transportation  use  and end of life  and at every single one of these stages  the things that we do have an interaction with the natural environment  and we can monitor how that interaction is actually affecting the systems and services that make life on Earth possible. And through doing this  we've learned some absolutely fascinating things. And we've busted a bunch of myths. So to start with  there's a word that's used a lot. It's used a lot in marketing  and it's used a lot  I think  in our conversation when we're talking about sustainability  and that's the word biodegradability. Now biodegradability is a material property  it is not a definition of environmental benefits. Allow me to explain. When something natural  something that's made from a cellulose fiber like a piece of bread  even  or any food waste  or even a piece of paper  when something natural ends up in the natural environment  it degrades normally. Its little carbon molecules that it stored up as it was growing are naturally released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide  but this is a net situation. Most natural things don't actually end up in nature. Most of the things  the waste that  we produce  end up in landfill. Landfill is a different environment. In landfill  those same carbon molecules degrade in a different way  because a landfill is anaerobic. It's got no oxygen. It's tightly compacted and hot. Those same molecules  they become methane  and methane is a    times more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. So our old lettuces and products that we have thrown out that are made out of biodegradable materials  if they end up in landfill  contribute to climate change. You see  there are facilities now that can actually capture that methane and generate power  displacing the need for fossil fuel power  but we need to be smart about this. We need to identify how we can start to leverage these types of things that are already happening and start to design systems and services that alleviate these problems. Because right now  what people do is they turn around and they say   Let's ban plastic bags. We'll give people paper because that is better for the environment.  But if you're throwing it in the bin  and your local landfill facility is just a normal one  then we're having what's called a double negative. I'm a product designer by trade. I then did social science. And so I'm absolutely fascinated by consumer goods and how the consumer goods that we have kind of become immune to that fill our lives have an impact on the natural environment. And these guys are  like  serial offenders  and I'm pretty sure everyone in this room has a refrigerator. Now America has this amazing ability to keep growing refrigerators. In the last few years  they've grown one cubic foot on average  the standard size of a refrigerator. And the problem is  they're so big now  it's easier for us to buy more food that we can't eat or find. I mean  I have things at the back of my refrigerator that have been there for years  all right  And so what happens is  we waste more food. And as I was just explaining  food waste is a problem. In fact  here in the U.S.     percent of food purchased for the home is wasted. Half of the world's produced food is wasted. That's the latest U.N. stats. Up to half of the food. It's insane. It's  .  billion tons of food per annum. And I blame it on the refrigerator  well  especially in Western cultures  because it makes it easier. I mean  there's a lot of complex systems going on here. I don't want to make it so simplistic. But the refrigerator is a serious contributor to this  and one of the features of it is the crisper drawer. You all got crisper drawers  The drawer that you put your lettuces in  Lettuces have a habit of going soggy in the crisper drawers  don't they  Yeah  Soggy lettuces  In the U.K.  this is such a problem that there was a government report a few years ago that actually said the second biggest offender of wasted food in the U.K. is the soggy lettuce. It was called the Soggy Lettuce Report. Okay  So this is a problem  people. These poor little lettuces are getting thrown out left  right and center because the crisper drawers are not designed to actually keep things crisp. Okay. You need a tight environment. You need  like  an airless environment to prevent the degrading that would happen naturally. But the crisper drawers  they're just a drawer with a slightly better seal. Anyway  I'm clearly obsessed. Don't ever invite me over because I'll just start going through your refrigerator and looking at all sorts of things like that. But essentially  this is a big problem. Because when we lose something like the lettuce from the system  not only do we have that impact  I just explained at the end of life  but we actually have had to grow that lettuce. The life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical. We've had to clear land. We've had to plant seeds  phosphorus  fertilizers  nutrients  water  sunlight. All of the embodied impacts in that lettuce get lost from the system  which makes it a far bigger environmental impact than the loss of the energy from the fridge. So we need to design things like this far better if we're going to start addressing serious environmental problems. We could start with the crisper drawer and the size. For those of you in the room who do design fridges  that would be great. The problem is  imagine if we actually started to reconsider  how we designed things. So I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity  but we actually haven't really changed the design of them that much since the     s. A little bit  but essentially they're still big boxes  cold boxes that we store stuff in. So imagine if we actually really started to identify these problems and use that as the foundation for finding innovative and elegant design solutions that will solve those problems. This is design led system change  design dictating the way in which the system can be far more sustainable. Forty percent food waste is a major problem. Imagine if we designed fridges that halved that. Another item that I find fascinating is the electric tea kettle  which I found out that you don't do tea kettles in this country  really  do you  But that's really big in the U.K. Ninety seven percent of households in the United Kingdom own an electric tea kettle. So they're very popular. And  I mean  if I were to work with a design firm or a designer  and they were designing one of these  and they wanted to do it eco  they'd usually ask me two things. They'd say   Leyla  how do I make it technically efficient   Because obviously energy's a problem with this product. Or   How do I make it green materials  How do I make the materials green in the manufacturing   Would you ask me those questions  They seem logical  right  Yeah. Well I'd say   You're looking at the wrong problems.  Because the problem is with use. It's with how people use the product. Sixty five percent of Brits admit to over filling their kettle when they only need one cup of tea. All of this extra water that's being boiled requires energy  and it's been calculated that in one day of extra energy use from boiling kettles is enough to light all of the streetlights in England for a night. But this is the thing. This is what I call a product person failure. But we've got a product system failure going on with these little guys  and they're so ubiquitous  you  don't even notice they're there. And this guy over here  though  he does. He's named Simon. Simon works for the national electricity company in the U.K. He has a very important job of monitoring all of the electricity coming into the system to make sure there is enough so it powers everybody's homes. He's also watching television. The reason is because there's a unique phenomenon that happens in the U.K. the moment that very popular TV shows end. The minute the ad break comes on  this man has to rush to buy nuclear power from France  because everybody turns their kettles on at the same time.  .  million kettles  seriously problematic. So imagine if you designed kettles  you actually found a way to solve these system failures  because this is a huge amount of pressure on the system  just because the product hasn't thought about the problem that it's going to have when it exists in the world. Now  I looked at a number of kettles available on the market  and found the minimum fill lines  so the little piece of information that tells you how much you need to put in there  was between two and a five and a half cups of water just to make one cup of tea. So this kettle here is an example of one where it actually has two reservoirs. One's a boiling chamber  and one's the water holder. The user actually has to push that button to get their hot water boiled  which means  because we're all lazy  you only fill exactly what you need. And this is what I call behavior changing products  products  systems or services that intervene and solve these problems up front. Now  this is a technology arena  so obviously these things are quite popular  but I think if we're going to keep designing  buying and using and throwing out these kinds of products at the rate we currently do  which is astronomically high  there are seven billion people who live in the world right now. There are six billion mobile phone subscriptions as of last year. Every single year   .  billion mobile phones roll off production lines  and some companies report their production rate as being greater than the human birth rate. One hundred fifty two million phones  were thrown out in the U.S. last year  only    percent were recycled. I'm from Australia. We have a population of    million    don't laugh    and it's been reported that    million phones are in people's drawers. We need to find ways of solving the problems around this  because these things are so complicated. They have so much locked up inside them. Gold  Did you know that it's actually cheaper now to get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones than it is out of a ton of gold ore  There's a number of highly complex and valuable materials embodied inside these things  so we need to find ways of encouraging disassembly  because this is otherwise what happens. This is a community in Ghana  and e waste is reported  or electronic waste is reported by the U.N. as being up to    million tons trafficked. This is how they get the gold and the other valuable materials out. They burn the electronic waste in open spaces. These are communities  and this is happening all over the world. And because we don't see the ramifications of the choices that we make as designers  as businesspeople  as consumers  then these kinds of externalities happen  and these are people's lives. So we need to find smarter  more systems based  innovative solutions to these problems  if we're going to start to live sustainably within this world. So imagine if  when you bought your mobile phone  your new one because you replaced your old one    after    to    months is the average time that people replace their phones  by the way   so if we're going to keep this kind of expedient mobile phone replacing  then we should be looking at closing the loop on these systems. The people who produce these phones  and some of which I'm sure are in the room right now  could potentially look at doing what we call closed loop systems  or product system services  so identifying that there is a market demand and that market demand's not going to go anywhere  so you design the product to solve the problem. Design for disassembly  design for light weighting. We heard some of those kinds of strategies being used in the Tesla Motors car today. These kinds of approaches are not hard  but understanding the system and then looking for viable  market driven consumer demand alternatives is how we can start radically altering the sustainability agenda  because I hate to break it to you all  Consumption is the biggest problem. But design is one of the best solutions. These kinds of products are everywhere. By identifying alternative ways of doing things  we can actually start to innovate  and I say actually start to innovate. I'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative. But in the regards to using sustainability as a parameter  as a criteria for fueling systems based solutions  because as I've just demonstrated with these simple products  they're participating in these major problems. So we need to look across the entire life of the things that we do. If you just had paper or plastic    obviously reusable is far more beneficial    then the paper is worse  and the paper is worse because it weighs four to    times more than the plastic  and when we actually compare  from a life cycle perspective  a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper  the paper is far better  but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag to carry your groceries home is not  done with a kilo of each material. It's done with a very small amount of plastic and quite a lot more paper. Because functionality defines environmental impact  and I said earlier that the designers always ask me for the eco materials. I say  there's only a few materials that you should completely avoid. The rest of them  it's all about application  and at the end of the day  everything we design and produce in the economy or buy as consumers is done so for function. We want something  therefore we buy it. So breaking things back down and delivering smartly  elegantly  sophisticated solutions that take into consideration the entire system and the entire life of the thing  everything  all the way back to the extraction through to the end of life  we can start to actually find really innovative solutions. And I'll just leave you with one very quick thing that a designer said to me recently  who I work with  a senior designer. I said   How come you're not doing  sustainability  I know you know this.  And he said   Well  recently I pitched a sustainability project to a client  and turned and he said to me  'I know it's going to cost less  I know it's going to sell more  but we're not pioneers  because pioneers have arrows in their backs.'  I think we've got a roomful of pioneers  and I hope there are far more pioneers out there  because we need to solve these problems. Thank you. The world is changing in some really profound ways  and I worry that investors aren't paying enough attention to some of the biggest drivers of change  especially when it comes to sustainability. And by sustainability  I mean the really juicy things  like environmental and social issues and corporate governance. I think it's reckless to ignore these things  because doing so can jeopardize future long term returns. And here's something that may surprise you  the balance of power to really influence sustainability rests with institutional investors  the large investors like pension funds  foundations and endowments. I believe that sustainable investing is less complicated than you think  better performing than you believe  and more important than we can imagine. Let me remind you what we already know. We have a population that's both growing and aging  we have seven billion souls today heading to    billion at the end of the century  we consume natural resources faster than they can be replenished  and the emissions that are mainly responsible for climate change just keep increasing. Now clearly  these are environmental and social issues  but that's not all. They're economic issues  and that makes them relevant to risk and return. And they are really complex and they can seem really far off  that the temptation may be to do this  bury our heads in the sand and not think about it. Resist this  if you can. Don't do this at home. But it makes me wonder if the investment rules of today are fit for purpose tomorrow. We know that investors  when they look at a company and decide whether to invest  they look at financial data  metrics like sales growth  cash flow  market share  valuation    you know  the really sexy stuff. And these things are fundamental  of course  but they're not enough. Investors should also look at performance metrics in what we call ESG  environment  social and governance. Environment includes energy consumption  water availability  waste and pollution  just making efficient uses of resources. Social includes human capital  things like employee engagement and innovation capacity  as well as supply chain management and labor rights and human rights. And governance relates to the oversight of companies by their boards and investors. See  I told you this is the really juicy stuff. But ESG is the measure of sustainability  and sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors with financial factors into the investment process. It means limiting future risk by minimizing harm to people and planet  and it means providing capital to users who deploy it towards productive and sustainable outcomes. So if sustainability matters financially today  and all signs indicate more tomorrow  is the private sector paying attention  Well  the really cool thing is that most CEOs are. They started to see sustainability not just as important but crucial to business success. About    percent of global CEOs see sustainability as the root to growth in innovation and leading to competitive advantage in their industries. But    percent see ESG as the future  or as important to the future of their business. So the views of CEOs are clear. There's tremendous opportunity in sustainability. So how are companies actually leveraging ESG to drive hard business results  One example is near and dear to our hearts. In       State Street migrated    applications to the cloud environment  and we retired another   . We virtualized our operating system environments  and we completed numerous automation projects. Now these initiatives create a more mobile workplace  and they reduce our real estate footprint  and they yield savings of    million dollars in operating costs annually  and avoid the emissions of a         metric tons of carbon. That's the equivalent of taking        cars off the road. So awesome  right  Another example is Pentair. Pentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate  and about a decade ago  they sold their core power tools business and reinvested those proceeds in a water business. That's a really big bet. Why did they do that  Well  with apologies to the Home Improvement fans  there's more growth in water than in power tools  and this company has their sights set on what they call  the new New World.  That's four billion middle class people demanding food  energy and water. Now  you may be asking yourself  are these just isolated cases  I mean  come on  really  Do companies that take sustainability into account really do well financially  The answer that may surprise you is yes. The data shows that stocks with better ESG performance perform just as well as others. In blue  we see the MSCI World. It's an index of large companies from developed markets across the world. And in gold  we see a subset of companies rated as having the best ESG performance. Over three plus years  no performance tradeoff. So that's okay  right  We want more. I want more. In some cases  there may be outperformance from ESG. In blue  we see the performance of the     largest global companies  and in gold  we see a subset of companies with best practice in climate change strategy and risk management. Now over almost eight years  they've outperformed by about two thirds. So yes  this is correlation. It's not causation. But it does illustrate that environmental leadership is compatible with good returns. So if the returns are the same or better and the planet benefits  wouldn't this be the norm  Are investors  particularly institutional investors  engaged  Well  some are  and a few are really at the vanguard. Hesta. Hesta is a retirement fund for health and community services employees in Australia  with assets of    billion  dollars . They believe that ESG has the potential to impact risks and returns  so incorporating it into the investment process is core to their duty to act in the best interest of fund members  core to their duty. You gotta love the Aussies  right  CalPERS is another example. CalPERS is the pension fund for public employees in California  and with assets of     billion  dollars   they are the second largest in the U.S. and the sixth largest in the world. Now  they're moving toward     percent sustainable investment by systematically integrated ESG across the entire fund. Why  They believe it's critical to superior long term returns  full stop. In their own words   long term value creation requires the effective management of three forms of capital  financial  human  and physical. This is why we are concerned with ESG.  Now  I do speak to a lot of investors as part of my job  and not all of them see it this way. Often I hear   We are required to maximize returns  so we don't do that here   or   We don't want to use the portfolio to make policy statements.  The one that just really gets under my skin is   If you want to do something about that  just make money  give the profits to charities.  It's eyes rolling  eyes rolling. I mean  let me clarify something right here. Companies and investors are not singularly responsible for the fate of the planet. They don't have indefinite social obligations  and prudent investing and finance theory aren't subordinate to sustainability. They're compatible. So I'm not talking about tradeoffs here. But institutional investors are the x factor in sustainability. Why do they hold the key  The answer  quite simply  is  they have the money. A lot of it. I mean  a really lot of it. The global stock market is worth    trillion dollars. The global bond market     trillion. That's     trillion combined. That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S. That's the world's largest economy. That's some serious freaking firepower. So we can reconsider some of these pressing challenges  like fresh water  clean air  feeding    billion mouths  if institutional investors integrated ESG into investment. What if they used that firepower to allocate more of their capital to companies working the hardest at solving these challenges or at least not exacerbating them  What if we work and save and invest  only to find that the world we retire into is more stressed and less secure than it is now  What if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water  Now a fair question might be  what if all this sustainability risk stuff is exaggerated  overstated  it's not urgent  something for virtuous consumers or lifestyle choice  Well  President John F. Kennedy said something about this that is just spot on   There are risks and costs to a program of action  but they are far less than the long range risks and costs of comfortable inaction.  I can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this  but since this is based on widespread scientific consensus  the odds that it's not completely wrong are better than the odds that our house will burn down or we'll get in a car accident. Well  maybe not if you live in Boston.  Laughter  But my point is that we buy insurance to protect ourselves financially in case those things happen  right  So by investing sustainably we're doing two things. We're creating insurance  reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy  and at the same time  in the short term  we're not sacrificing performance.  Man in comic   What if it's a big hoax  and we create a better world for nothing    Good  you like it. I like it too. I like it because it pokes fun at both sides of the climate change issue. I bet you can't guess which side I'm on. But what I really like about it is that it reminds me of something Mark Twain said  which is   Plan for the future  because that's where you're going to spend the rest of your life.  Thank you. I'd like to talk today about a powerful and fundamental aspect of who we are  our voice. Each one of us has a unique voiceprint that reflects our age  our size  even our lifestyle and personality. In the words of the poet Longfellow   the human voice is the organ of the soul.  As a speech scientist  I'm fascinated by how the voice is produced  and I have an idea for how it can be engineered. That's what I'd like to share with you. I'm going to start by playing you a sample of a voice that you may recognize. it was fairly obvious what I meant.  Rupal Patel  That was the voice of Professor Stephen Hawking. What you may not know is that same voice may also be used by this little girl who is unable to speak because of a neurological condition. In fact  all of these individuals may be using the same voice  and that's because there's only a few options available. In the U.S. alone  there are  .  million Americans who are unable to speak  and many of whom use computerized devices to communicate. Now that's millions of people worldwide who are using generic voices  including Professor Hawking  who uses an American accented voice. This lack of individuation of the synthetic voice really hit home when I was at an assistive technology conference a few years ago  and I recall walking into an exhibit hall and seeing a little girl and a grown man having a conversation using their devices  different devices  but the same voice. And I looked around and I saw this happening all around me  literally hundreds of individuals using a handful of voices  voices that didn't fit their bodies or their personalities. We wouldn't dream of fitting a little girl with the prosthetic limb of a grown man. So why then the same prosthetic voice  It really struck me  and I wanted to do something about this. I'm going to play you now a sample of someone who has  two people actually  who have severe speech disorders. I want you to take a listen to how they sound. They're saying the same utterance. You probably didn't understand what they said  but I hope that you heard their unique vocal identities. So what I wanted to do next is  I wanted to find out how we could harness these residual vocal abilities and build a technology that could be customized for them  voices that could be customized for them. So I reached out to my collaborator  Tim Bunnell. Dr. Bunnell is an expert in speech synthesis  and what he'd been doing is building personalized voices for people by putting together pre recorded samples of their voice and reconstructing a voice for them. These are people who had lost their voice later in life. We didn't have the luxury of pre recorded samples of speech for those born with speech disorder. But I thought  there had to be a way to reverse engineer a voice from whatever little is left over. So we decided to do exactly that. We set out with a little bit of funding from the National Science Foundation  to create custom crafted voices that captured their unique vocal identities. We call this project VocaliD  or vocal I.D.  for vocal identity. Now before I get into the details of how the voice is made and let you listen to it  I need to give you a real quick speech science lesson. Okay  So first  we know that the voice is changing dramatically over the course of development. Children sound different from teens who sound different from adults. We've all experienced this. Fact number two is that speech is a combination of the source  which is the vibrations generated by your voice box  which are then pushed through the rest of the vocal tract. These are the chambers of your head and neck that vibrate  and they actually filter that source sound to produce consonants and vowels. So the combination of source and filter is how we produce speech. And that happens in one individual. Now I told you earlier that I'd spent a good part of my career understanding and studying the source characteristics of people with severe speech disorder  and what I've found is that even though their filters were impaired  they were able to modulate their source  the pitch  the loudness  the tempo of their voice. These are called prosody  and I've been documenting for years that the prosodic abilities of these individuals are preserved. So when I realized that those same cues are also important for speaker identity  I had this idea. Why don't we take the source from the person we want the voice to sound like  because it's preserved  and borrow the filter from someone about the same age and size  because they can articulate speech  and then mix them  Because when we mix them  we can get a voice that's as clear as our surrogate talker    that's the person we borrowed the filter from  and is similar in identity to our target talker. It's that simple. That's the science behind what we're doing. So once you have that in mind  how do you go about building this voice  Well  you have to find someone who is willing to be a surrogate. It's not such an ominous thing. Being a surrogate donor only requires you to say a few hundred to a few thousand utterances. The process goes something like this. I love to sleep. The sky is blue without clouds. RP  Now she's going to go on like this for about three to four hours  and the idea is not for her to say everything that the target is going to want to say  but the idea is to cover all the different combinations of the sounds that occur in the language. The more speech you have  the better sounding voice you're going to have. Once you have those recordings  what we need to do is we have to parse these recordings into little snippets of speech  one  or two sound combinations  sometimes even whole words that start populating a dataset or a database. We're going to call this database a voice bank. Now the power of the voice bank is that from this voice bank  we can now say any new utterance  like   I love chocolate     everyone needs to be able to say that  fish through that database and find all the segments necessary to say that utterance. RP  So that's speech synthesis. It's called concatenative synthesis  and that's what we're using. That's not the novel part. What's novel is how we make it sound like this young woman. This is Samantha. I met her when she was nine  and since then  my team and I have been trying to build her a personalized voice. We first had to find a surrogate donor  and then we had to have Samantha produce some utterances. What she can produce are mostly vowel like sounds  but that's enough for us to extract her source characteristics. What happens next is best described by my daughter's analogy. She's six. She calls it mixing colors to paint voices. It's beautiful. It's exactly that. Samantha's voice is like a concentrated sample of red food dye which we can infuse into the recordings of her surrogate to get a pink voice just like this. RP  So now  Samantha can say this. I can't wait to use my new voice with my friends. RP  Thank you.  Applause  I'll never forget the gentle smile that spread across her face when she heard that voice for the first time. Now there's millions of people around the world like Samantha  millions  and we've only begun to scratch the surface. What we've done so far is we have a few surrogate talkers from around the U.S. who have donated their voices  and we have been using those to build our first few personalized voices. But there's so much more work to be done. For Samantha  her surrogate came from somewhere in the Midwest  a stranger who gave her the gift of voice. And as a scientist  I'm so excited to take this work out of the laboratory and finally into the real world so it can have real world impact. What I want to share with you next is how I envision taking this work to that next level. I imagine a whole world of surrogate donors from all walks of life  different sizes  different ages  coming together in this voice drive to give people voices that are as colorful as their personalities. To do that as a first step  we've put together this website  VocaliD.org  as a way to bring together those who want to join us as voice donors  as expertise donors  in whatever way to make this vision a reality. They say that giving blood can save lives. Well  giving your voice can change lives. All we need is a few hours of speech from our surrogate talker  and as little as a vowel from our target talker  to create a unique vocal identity. So that's the science behind what we're doing. I want to end by circling back to the human side that is really the inspiration for this work. About five years ago  we built our very first voice for a little boy named William. When his mom first heard this voice  she said   This is what William would have sounded like had he been able to speak.  And then I saw William typing a message on his device. I wondered  what was he thinking  Imagine carrying around someone else's voice for nine years and finally finding your own voice. Imagine that. This is what William said   Never heard me before.  Thank you. What is love  It's a hard term to define in so far as it has a very wide application. I can love jogging. I can love a book  a movie. I can love escalopes. I can love my wife. But there's a great difference between an escalope and my wife  for instance. That is  if I value the escalope  the escalope  on the other hand   it doesn't value me back. Whereas my wife  she calls me the star of her life. Therefore  only another desiring conscience can conceive me as a desirable being. I know this  that's why love can be defined in a more accurate way as the desire of being desired. Hence the eternal problem of love  how to become and remain desirable  The individual used to find an answer to this problem by submitting his life to community rules. You had a specific part to play according to your sex  your age  your social status  and you only had to play your part to be valued and loved by the whole community. Think about the young woman who must remain chaste before marriage. Think about the youngest son  who must obey the eldest son  who in turn must obey the patriarch. But a phenomenon started in the   th century  mainly in the Renaissance  in the West  that caused the biggest identity crisis in the history of humankind. This phenomenon is modernity. We can basically summarize it through a triple process. First  a process of rationalization of scientific research  which has accelerated technical progress. Next  a process of political democratization  which has fostered individual rights. And finally  a process of rationalization  of economic production and of trade liberalization. These three intertwined processes have completely annihilated all the traditional bearings of Western societies  with radical consequences for the individual. Now individuals are free to value or disvalue any attitude  any choice  any object. But as a result  they are themselves confronted with this same freedom that others have to value or disvalue them. In other words  my value was once ensured by submitting myself  to the traditional authorities. Now it is quoted in the stock exchange. On the free market of individual desires  I negotiate my value every day. Hence the anxiety of contemporary man. He is obsessed   Am I desirable  How desirable  How many people are going to love me   And how does he respond to this anxiety  Well  by hysterically collecting symbols of desirability. I call this act of collecting  along with others  seduction capital. Indeed  our consumer society is largely based on seduction capital. It is said about this consumption that our age is materialistic. But it's not true  We only accumulate objects in order to communicate with other minds. We do it to make them love us  to seduce them. Nothing could be less materialistic   or more sentimental  than a teenager buying brand new jeans and tearing them at the knees  because he wants to please Jennifer. Consumerism is not materialism. It is rather what is swallowed up and sacrificed in the name of the god of love  or rather in the name of seduction capital. In light of this observation on contemporary love  how can we think of love in the years to come  We can envision two hypotheses  The first one consists of betting that this process of narcissistic  capitalization will intensify. It is hard to say what shape  this intensification will take  because it largely depends on social and technical innovations  which are by definition difficult to predict. But we can  for instance  imagine a dating website which  a bit like those loyalty points programs  uses seduction capital points that vary according to my age   my height weight ratio  my degree  my salary  or the number of clicks on my profile. We can also imagine a chemical treatment for breakups that weakens the feelings of attachment. By the way  there's a program on MTV already in which seduction teachers treat heartache as a disease. These teachers call themselves  pick up artists.   Artist  in French is easy  it means  artiste.   Pick up  is to pick someone up  but not just any picking up    it's picking up chicks. So they are artists of picking up chicks. And they call heartache  one itis.  In English   itis  is a suffix that signifies infection. One itis can be translated as  an infection from one.  It's a bit disgusting. Indeed  for the pick up artists  falling in love with someone is a waste of time  it's squandering your seduction capital  so it must be eliminated like a disease  like an infection. We can also envision a romantic use of the genome. Everyone would carry it around and present it like a business card to verify if seduction can progress to reproduction. Of course  this race for seduction  like every fierce competition  will create huge disparities  in narcissistic satisfaction  and therefore a lot of loneliness and frustration too. So we can expect that modernity itself  which is the origin of seduction capital  would be called into question. I'm thinking particularly of the reaction of neo fascist or religious communes. But such a future doesn't have to be. Another path to thinking about love may be possible. But how  How to renounce the hysterical need to be valued  Well  by becoming aware of my uselessness. Yes  I'm useless. But rest assured  so are you. We are all useless. This uselessness is easily demonstrated  because in order to be valued I need another to desire me  which shows that I do not have any value of my own. I don't have any inherent value. We all pretend to have an idol  we all pretend to be an idol for someone else  but actually we are all impostors  a bit like a man on the street who appears totally cool and indifferent  while he has actually anticipated and calculated so that all eyes are on him. I think that becoming aware of this general imposture that concerns all of us would ease our love relationships. It is because I want to be loved from head to toe  justified in my every choice  that the seduction hysteria exists. And therefore I want to seem perfect so that another can love me. I want them to be perfect so that I can be reassured of my value. It leads to couples obsessed with performance who will break up  just like that  at the slightest underachievement. In contrast to this attitude  I call upon tenderness    love as tenderness. What is tenderness  To be tender is to accept  the loved one's weaknesses. It's not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies. That's pretty bad. On the contrary  there's plenty of charm and happiness in tenderness. I refer specifically to a kind of humor that is unfortunately underused. It is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness. I refer to self mockery. For a couple who is no longer sustained  supported by the constraints of tradition  I believe that self mockery is one of the best means for  the relationship to endure. As humans  it's in our nature to want to improve our health  and minimize our suffering. Whatever life throws at us  whether it's cancer  diabetes  heart disease  or even broken bones  we want to try and get better. Now I'm head of a biomaterials lab  and I'm really fascinated by the way that humans have used materials in really creative ways in the body over time. Take  for example  this beautiful blue nacre shell. This was actually used by the Mayans as an artificial tooth replacement. We're not quite sure why they did it. It's hard. It's durable. But it also had other very nice properties. In fact  when they put it into the jawbone  it could integrate into the jaw  and we know now with very sophisticated imaging technologies that part of that integration comes from the fact that this material is designed in a very specific way  has a beautiful chemistry  has a beautiful architecture. And I think in many ways we can sort of think of the use of the blue nacre shell and the Mayans as the first real application of the bluetooth technology. But if we move on and think throughout history how people have used different  materials in the body  very often it's been physicians that have been quite creative. They've taken things off the shelf. One of my favorite examples is that of Sir Harold Ridley  who was a famous ophthalmologist  or at least became a famous ophthalmologist. And during World War II  what he would see would be pilots coming back from their missions  and he noticed that within their eyes they had shards of small bits of material lodged within the eye  but the very interesting thing about it was that material  actually  wasn't causing any inflammatory response. So he looked into this  and he figured out that actually that material was little shards of plastic that were coming from the canopy of the Spitfires. And this led him to propose that material as a new material for intraocular lenses. It's called PMMA  and it's now used in millions of people every year and helps in preventing cataracts. And that example  I think  is a really nice one  because it helps remind us that in the early days  people often chose materials because they were bioinert. Their very purpose was to  perform a mechanical function. You'd put them in the body and you wouldn't get an adverse response. And what I want to show you is that in regenerative medicine  we've really shifted away from that idea of taking a bioinert material. We're actually actively looking for materials that will be bioactive  that will interact with the body  and that furthermore we can put in the body  they'll have their function  and then they'll dissolve away over time. If we look at this schematic  this is showing you what we think of as the typical tissue engineering approach. We have cells there  typically from the patient. We can put those onto a material  and we can make that material  very complex if we want to  and we can then grow that up in the lab or we can put it straight back into the patient. And this is an approach that's  used all over the world  including in our lab. But one of the things that's really important when we're thinking about stem cells is that obviously stem cells  can be many different things  and they want to be many different things  and so we want to make sure that the environment we put them into has enough information so that they can become the right sort of specialist tissue. And if we think about the different types of tissues that people are looking at regenerating all over the world  in all the  different labs in the world  there's pretty much every tissue you can think of. And actually  the structure of those tissues is quite different  and it's going to really depend on whether your patient has any underlying disease  other conditions  in terms of how you're going to regenerate your tissue  and you're going to need to think about the materials you're going to use really carefully  their biochemistry  their mechanics  and many other properties as well. Our tissues all have very  different abilities to regenerate  and here we see poor Prometheus  who made a rather tricky career choice and was punished by the Greek gods. He was tied to a rock  and an eagle would come every day to eat his liver. But of course his liver would regenerate every day  and so day after day he was punished for eternity by the gods. And liver will regenerate in this very nice way  but actually if we think of other tissues  like cartilage  for example  even the simplest nick and you're going to find it really difficult to regenerate your cartilage. So it's going to be very different from tissue to tissue. Now  bone is somewhere in between  and this is one of the tissues  that we work on a lot in our lab. And bone is actually quite good at repairing. It has to be. We've probably all had fractures at some point or other. And one of the ways that you can think about repairing your fracture is this procedure here  called  an iliac crest harvest. And what the surgeon might do is take some bone from your iliac crest  which is just here  and then transplant that  somewhere else in the body. And it actually works really well  because it's your own bone  and it's well vascularized  which means it's got a really good blood supply. But the problem is  there's only so much you can take  and also when you do that operation  your patients might actually have significant pain in that defect site even two  years after the operation. So what we were thinking is  there's a tremendous need  for bone repair  of course  but this iliac crest type approach really has a lot of limitations to it  and could we perhaps recreate the generation of bone within the body on demand and then be able to transplant it without these very  very painful aftereffects that you would have with the iliac crest harvest  And so this is what we did  and the way we did it was by coming back to this typical tissue engineering approach but actually thinking about it rather differently. And we simplified it a lot  so we got rid of a lot of these steps. We got rid of the need to  harvest cells from the patient  we got rid of the need to put  in really fancy chemistries  and we got rid of the need to culture these scaffolds in the lab. And what we really focused on was our material system and making it quite simple  but because we used it in a really clever way  we were able to generate enormous amounts of bone using this approach. So we were using the body as really the catalyst to help us to make lots of new bone. And it's an approach that we call the in vivo bioreactor  and we were able to make enormous amounts of bone using this approach. And I'll talk you through this. So what we do is  in humans  we all have a layer of stem cells on the outside of our long bones. That layer is called the periosteum. And that layer is actually normally very  very tightly bound to the underlying bone  and it's got stem cells in it. Those stem cells are really important in the embryo when it develops  and they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture to help you with repairing the bone. So we take that periosteum layer and we developed a way to inject underneath it a liquid that then  within    seconds  would turn into quite a rigid gel and can actually lift the periosteum away from the bone. So it creates  in essence  an artificial cavity that is right next to both the bone but also this really rich layer of stem cells. And we go in through a pinhole incision so that no other cells from the body can get in  and what happens is that that artificial in vivo bioreactor cavity can then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells  and they can form lots of new tissue  and then over time  you can harvest that tissue and use it elsewhere in the body. This is a histology slide of what we see when we do that  and essentially what we see is very large amounts of bone. So in this picture  you can see the middle of the leg  so the bone marrow  then you can see the original bone  and you can see where that original bone finishes  and just to the left of that is the new bone that's grown within that bioreactor cavity  and you can actually make it even larger. And that demarcation that you can see between the original bone and the new bone acts as a very slight point of weakness  so actually now the surgeon can come along  can harvest away that new bone  and the periosteum can grow back  so you're left with the leg in the same sort of state as if you hadn't operated on it in the first place. So it's very  very low in terms of after pain compared to an iliac crest harvest. And you can grow different amounts of bone depending on how much gel you put in there  so it really is an on demand sort of procedure. Now  at the time that we did this  this received a lot of attention in the press  because it was a really nice way of generating new bone  and we got many  many contacts from different people that  were interested in using this. And I'm just going to tell you  sometimes those contacts are very strange  slightly unexpected  and the very most interesting  let me put it that way  contact that I had  was actually from a team of American footballers that all wanted to have double thickness skulls made on their head. And so you do get these kinds of contacts  and of course  being British and also growing up in France  I tend to be very blunt  and so I had to explain to them very nicely that in their particular case  there probably wasn't that much in there to protect in the first place. So this was our approach  and it was simple materials  but we thought about it carefully. And actually we know that those cells in the body  in the embryo  as they develop can form a different kind of tissue  cartilage  and so we developed a gel that was slightly different in nature and slightly different chemistry  put it in there  and we were able to get     percent cartilage instead. And this approach works really well  I think  for pre planned procedures  but it's something you do have to pre plan. So for other kinds of operations  there's definitely a need for other scaffold based approaches. And when you think about designing those other scaffolds  actually  you need a really multi disciplinary team. And so our team has chemists  it has cell biologists  surgeons  physicists even  and those people all come together and we think really hard about  designing the materials. But we want to make them have enough information that we can get the cells to do what we want  but not be so complex as to make it difficult to get to clinic. And so one of the things we think about a lot is really trying to understand the structure of the tissues in the body. And so if we think of bone  obviously my own favorite tissue  we zoom in  we can see  even if you don't know anything  about bone structure  it's beautifully organized   really beautifully organized. We've lots of blood vessels in there. And if we zoom in again  we see that the cells are actually surrounded by a  D matrix of nano scale fibers  and they give a lot of information to the cells. And if we zoom in again  actually in the case of bone  the matrix around the cells is beautifully organized at the nano scale  and it's a hybrid material that's part organic  part inorganic. And that's led to a whole field  really  that has looked at developing materials that have this hybrid kind of structure. And so I'm showing here just two examples where we've made some materials that have that sort of structure  and you can really tailor it. You can see here a very squishy one and now a material that's also  this hybrid sort of material but actually has remarkable toughness  and it's no longer brittle. And an inorganic material  would normally be really brittle  and you wouldn't be able to have that sort of strength and toughness in it. One other thing I want to quickly mention is that many of the scaffolds we make  are porous  and they have to be  because you want blood vessels to grow in there. But the pores are actually oftentimes much bigger than the cells  and so even though it's  D  the cell might see it more  as a slightly curved surface  and that's a little bit unnatural. And so one of the things you can think about doing is actually making scaffolds  with slightly different dimensions that might be able to surround your cells in  D and give them a little bit more information. And there's a lot of work going  on in both of these areas. Now finally  I just want to talk a little bit about applying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease  because this is a really big clinical problem. And one of the things that we know is that  unfortunately  if you have a heart attack  then that tissue can start to die  and your outcome may not be very good over time. And it would be really great  actually  if we could stop that dead tissue either from dying or help it to regenerate. And there's lots and lots of stem  cell trials going on worldwide  and they use many different types of cells  but one common theme that seems to be coming out is that actually  very often  those cells will die once you've implanted them. And you can either put them into the heart or into the blood system  but either way  we don't seem to be able to get quite the right number of cells getting to the location we want them to and being able to deliver the sort of beautiful cell regeneration that we would like to have to get good clinical outcomes. And so some of the things that we're thinking of  and many other people in the field are thinking of  are actually developing materials for that. But there's a difference here. We still need chemistry  we still need mechanics  we still need really interesting topography  and we still need really interesting  ways to surround the cells. But now  the cells also would probably quite like a material that's going to be able to be conductive  because the cells themselves will respond very well and will actually conduct signals  between themselves. You can see them now beating synchronously on these materials  and that's a very  very exciting development that's going on. So just to wrap up  I'd like to actually say that being able to work in this sort of field  all of us that work in this field that's not only super exciting science  but also has the potential to impact on patients  however big or small they are  is really a great privilege. And so for that  I'd like to thank all of you as well. Thank you. What makes a great leader today  Many of us carry this image of this all knowing superhero who stands and commands and protects his followers. But that's kind of an image from another time  and what's also outdated are the leadership development programs that are based on success models for a world that was  not a world that is or that is coming. We conducted a study of       companies  and we asked them  let's see the effectiveness of your leadership development programs. Fifty eight percent of the companies cited significant talent gaps for critical leadership roles. That means that despite corporate training programs  off sites  assessments  coaching  all of these things  more than half the companies had failed to grow enough great leaders. You may be asking yourself  is my company helping me to prepare to be a great   st century leader  The odds are  probably not. Now  I've spent    years of my professional life observing what makes great leaders. I've worked inside Fortune     companies  I've advised over     CEOs  and I've cultivated more leadership pipelines than you can imagine. But a few years ago  I noticed a disturbing trend in leadership preparation. I noticed that  despite all the efforts  there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing about individuals. One story was about Chris  a high potential  superstar leader who moves to a new unit and fails  destroying unrecoverable value. And then there were stories like Sidney  the CEO  who was so frustrated because her company is cited as a best company for leaders  but only one of the top    leaders is equipped to lead their crucial initiatives. And then there were stories like the senior leadership team of a once thriving business that's surprised by a market shift  finds itself having to force the company to reduce its size in half or go out of business. Now  these recurring stories cause me to ask two questions. Why are the leadership gaps widening when there's so much more investment in leadership development  And what are the great leaders doing distinctly different to thrive and grow  One of the things that I did  I was so consumed by these questions and also frustrated by those stories  that I left my job so that I could study this full time  and I took a year to travel to different parts of the world to learn about effective and ineffective leadership practices in companies  countries and nonprofit organizations. And so I did things like travel to South Africa  where I had an opportunity to understand how Nelson Mandela was ahead of his time in anticipating and navigating his political  social and economic context. I also met a number of nonprofit leaders who  despite very limited financial resources  were making a huge impact in the world  often bringing together seeming adversaries. And I spent countless hours in presidential libraries trying to understand how the environment had shaped the leaders  the moves that they made  and then the impact of those moves beyond their tenure. And then  when I returned to work full time  in this role  I joined with wonderful colleagues who were also interested in these questions. Now  from all this  I distilled the characteristics of leaders who are thriving and what they do differently  and then I also distilled the preparation practices that enable people to grow to their potential. I want to share some of those with you now. In a   st century world  which is more global  digitally enabled and transparent  with faster speeds of information  flow and innovation  and where nothing big gets done without some kind of a complex matrix  relying on traditional development practices will stunt your growth as a leader. In fact  traditional assessments like narrow     surveys or outdated performance criteria will give you false positives  lulling you into thinking that you are more prepared than you really are. Leadership in the   st century is defined and evidenced by three questions. Where are you looking to anticipate the next change to your business model or your life  The answer to this question is on your calendar. Who are you spending time with  On what topics  Where are you traveling  What are you reading  And then how are you distilling this into understanding potential discontinuities  and then making a decision to do something right now so that you're prepared and ready  There's a leadership team that does a practice where they bring together each member collecting  here are trends that impact me  here are trends that impact another team member  and they share these  and then make decisions  to course correct a strategy or to anticipate a new move. Great leaders are not head down. They see around corners  shaping their future  not just reacting to it. The second question is  what is the diversity measure of your personal and professional stakeholder network  You know  we hear often about  good ol' boy networks and they're certainly alive and  well in many institutions. But to some extent  we all have a network of people that we're comfortable with. So this question is about your capacity to develop relationships with people that are very different than you. And those differences can be biological  physical  functional  political   cultural  socioeconomic. And yet  despite all these differences  they connect with you and they trust you enough to cooperate with you in achieving a shared goal. Great leaders understand that having a more diverse network is a source of pattern identification at greater levels and also of solutions  because you have people that are thinking differently than you are. Third question  are you courageous enough to abandon a practice that has  made you successful in the past  There's an expression  Go along to get along. But if you follow this advice  chances are as a leader  you're going to keep doing what's familiar and comfortable. Great leaders dare to be different. They don't just talk about risk taking  they actually do it. And one of the leaders shared with me the fact that the most impactful development comes when you are able to build the emotional stamina to withstand people telling you that your new idea is na ve or reckless or just plain stupid. Now interestingly  the people who will join you are not your usual suspects in your network. They're often people that think differently and therefore are willing to join you in taking a courageous leap. And it's a leap  not a step. More than traditional leadership programs  answering these three questions will determine your effectiveness as a   st century leader. So what makes a great leader in the   st century  I've met many  and they stand out. They are women and men who are preparing themselves not for the comfortable predictability of yesterday but also for the realities of today and all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow. Thank you. I'm going to go off script and make Chris quite nervous here by making this audience participation. All right. Are you with me  Yeah. Yeah. All right. So what I'd like to do is have you raise your hand if you've ever heard a heterosexual couple having sex. Could be the neighbors  hotel room  your parents. Sorry. Okay. Pretty much everybody. Now raise your hand if the man was making more noise than the woman. I see one guy there. It doesn't count if it was you  sir. So his hand's down. And one woman. Okay. Sitting next to a loud guy. Now what does this tell us  It tells us that human beings make noise when they have sex  and it's generally the woman who makes more noise. This is known as female copulatory vocalization to the clipboard crowd. I wasn't even going to mention this  but somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here  and she is the world's most famous female copulatory vocalizer. So I thought  got to talk about that. We'll get back to that a little bit later. Let me start by saying human beings are not descended from apes  despite what you may have heard. We are apes. We are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant  as Jared Diamond pointed out in one of his early books. We're more closely related to chimps and bonobos than chimps and bonobos are related to any other primate    gorillas  orangutans  what have you. So we're extremely closely related to them  and as you'll see in terms of our behavior  we've got some relationship as well. So what I'm asking today  the question I want to explore with you today is  what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality  Now  since Darwin's day there's been what Cacilda and I have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution  and you're all familiar with it  even if you haven't read this stuff. The idea is that  as part of human nature  from the beginning of our species' time  men have sort of leased women's reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services. Generally we're talking about meat  shelter  status  protection  things like that. And in exchange  women have offered fidelity  or at least a promise of fidelity. Now this sets men and women up in an oppositional relationship. The war between the sexes is built right into our DNA  according to this vision. Right  What Cacilda and I have argued is that no  this economic relationship  this oppositional relationship  is actually an artifact of agriculture  which only arose about        years ago at the earliest. Anatomically modern human beings have been around for about         years  so we're talking about five percent  at most  of our time as a modern  distinct species. So before agriculture  before the agricultural revolution  it's important to understand that human beings lived in hunter gatherer groups that are characterized wherever they're found in the world by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism. They not only share things  they demand that things be shared  meat  shelter  protection  all these things that were supposedly being traded to women for their sexual fidelity  it turns out  are shared widely among these societies. Now I'm not saying that our ancestors were noble savages  and I'm not saying modern day hunter gatherers are noble savages either. What I'm saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context. And there's really no argument about this among anthropologists. All Cacilda and I have done is extend this sharing behavior to sexuality. So we've argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved  until agriculture  as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex  flexible social systems  networks  that our ancestors were very good at  and that's why our species has survived so well. Now  this makes some people uncomfortable  and so I always need to take  a moment in these talks to say  listen  I'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous  but I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers. There were no strangers. Right  In a hunter gatherer band  there are no strangers. You've known these people your entire life. So I'm saying  yes  there were overlapping sexual relationships  that our ancestors probably had several different sexual relationships going on at any given moment in their adult lives. But I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers. I'm not saying that they didn't love the people they were having sex with. And I'm not saying there was no pair bonding going on. I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive. And those of us who have chosen to be monogamous    my parents  for example  have been married for    years monogamously  and if it wasn't monogamously  Mom and Dad  I don't want to hear about it  I'm not criticizing this and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this. What I'm saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism. You can choose to be a vegetarian  but don't think that just because you've made that decision  bacon suddenly stops smelling good. Okay  So this is my point. That one took a minute to sink in  huh  Now  in addition to being a great genius  a wonderful man  a wonderful husband  a wonderful father  Charles Darwin was also a world class Victorian prude. All right  He was perplexed by the sexual swellings of certain primates  including chimps and bonobos  because these sexual swellings tend to provoke many males to mate with the females. So he couldn't understand why on Earth would the female have developed this thing if all they were supposed to be doing is forming their pair bond  right  Chimps and bonobos  Darwin didn't really know this  but chimps and bonobos mate one to four times per hour with up to a dozen males per day when they have their sexual swellings. Interestingly  chimps have sexual swellings through    percent  roughly  of their menstrual cycle  bonobos    percent  and humans are among the only species on the planet where the female is available for sex throughout the menstrual cycle  whether she's menstruating  whether she's post menopausal  whether she's already pregnant. This is vanishingly rare among mammals. So it's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality. Now  Darwin ignored the reflections of the sexual swelling in his own day  as scientists tend to do sometimes. So what we're talking about is sperm competition. Now the average human ejaculate has about     million sperm cells  so it's already a competitive environment. The question is whether these sperm are  competing against other men's sperm or just their own. There's a lot to talk about in this chart. The one thing I'll call your attention to right away is the little musical note above the female chimp and bonobo and human. That indicates female copulatory vocalization. Just look at the numbers. The average human has sex about       times per birth. If that number seems high for some of you  I assure you it seems low for others in the room. We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos. We don't share it with the other three apes  the gorilla  the orangutan and the gibbon  who are more typical of mammals  having sex only about a dozen times per birth. Humans and bonobos are the only  animals that have sex face to face when both of them are alive. And you'll see that the human  chimp and bonobo all have external testicles  which in our book we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage just for beer. If you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge in the garage  you expect a party to happen at any moment  and you need to be ready. That's what the external testicles are. They keep the sperm cells cool so you can have frequent ejaculations. I'm sorry. It's true. The human  some of you will be happy to hear  has the largest  thickest penis of any primate. Now  this evidence goes way beyond anatomy. It goes into anthropology as well. Historical records are full of accounts of people around the world who have sexual practices that should be impossible given what we have assumed about human sexual evolution. These women are the Mosuo from southwestern China. In their society  everyone  men and women  are completely sexually autonomous. There's no shame associated with sexual behavior. Women have hundreds of partners. It doesn't matter. Nobody cares. Nobody gossips. It's not an issue. When the woman becomes pregnant  the child is cared for by her   her sisters  and her brothers. The biological father is a nonissue. On the other side of the planet  in the Amazon  we've got many tribes which practice what anthropologists call partible paternity. These people actually believe    and they have no contact among them  no common language or anything  so it's not an idea that spread  it's an idea that's arisen around the world    they believe that a fetus is literally made of accumulated semen. So a woman who wants to have a child who's smart and funny and strong makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy  the funny guy and the strong guy  to get the essence of each of these men into the baby  and then when the child is born  these different men will come forward and acknowledge their paternity of the child. So paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor in this society. So there are all sorts of examples like this that we go through in the book. Now  why does this matter  Edward Wilson says we need to understand that human sexuality is first a bonding device and only secondarily procreation. I think that's true. This matters because our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict with many aspects of the modern world. The contradictions between what we're told we should feel and what we actually do feel generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering. My hope is that a more accurate  updated understanding of human sexuality will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves  for each other  greater respect for unconventional relationship configurations like same sex marriage or polyamorous unions  and that we'll finally put to rest the idea that men have some innate  instinctive right to monitor and control women's sexual behavior. Thank you. And we'll see that it's not only gay people that have to come out of the closet. We all have closets we have to come out of. Right  And when we do come out of those closets  we'll recognize that our fight is not with each other  our fight is with an outdated   Victorian sense of human sexuality that conflates desire with property rights  generates shame and confusion in place of understanding and empathy. It's time we moved beyond Mars and Venus  because the truth is that men are from Africa and women are from Africa. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Christopher Ryan  Thank you. CA  So a question. It's so perplexing  trying to use arguments about evolutionary history to turn that into what we ought to do today. Someone could give a talk and say  look at us  we've got these really sharp teeth and muscles and a brain that's really good at throwing weapons  and if you look at lots of societies around the world  you'll see very high rates of violence. Nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism  but it's not who you are. How is that different from the talk you gave  CR  Well first of all  the evidence for high levels of violence in prehistory is very debatable. But that's just an example. Certainly  you know  lots of people say to me  just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn't mean we should live that  way now  and I agree with that. Everyone has to respond to the modern world. But the body does have its inherent evolved trajectories. And so you could live on McDonald's and milkshakes  but your body will rebel against  that. We have appetites. I think it was Schopenhauer who said  a person can do what they want but not want what they want. And so what I'm arguing against is the shame that's associated with desires. It's the idea that if you love your husband or wife but you still are attracted to other people  there's something wrong with you  there's something wrong with your marriage  something wrong with your partner. I think a lot of families are fractured by unrealistic expectations that are based upon this false vision of human sexuality. That's what I'm trying to get at. CA  Thank you. Communicated powerfully. Thanks a lot. CR  Thank you  Chris.  Applause  I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet  and not in the traditional sense  not just the gay closet. I think we all have closets. Your closet may be telling someone you love her for the first time  or telling someone that you're pregnant  or telling someone you have cancer  or any of the other hard conversations we have throughout our lives. All a closet is is a hard conversation  and although our topics may vary tremendously  the experience of being in and coming out of the closet is universal. It is scary  and we hate it  and it needs to be done. Several years ago  I was working at the South Side Walnut Cafe  a local diner in town  and during my time there I would go through phases of militant lesbian intensity  not shaving my armpits  quoting Ani DiFranco lyrics as gospel. And depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts and how recently I had shaved my head  the question would often be sprung on me  usually by a little kid   Um  are you a boy or are you a girl   And there would be an awkward silence at the table. I'd clench my jaw a little tighter  hold my coffee pot with a little more vengeance. The dad would awkwardly shuffle his newspaper and the mom would shoot a chilling stare at her kid. But I would say nothing  and I would seethe inside. And it got to the point where every time I walked up to a table that had a kid anywhere between three and    years old  I was ready to fight. And that is a terrible feeling. So I promised myself  the next time  I would say something. I would have that hard conversation. So within a matter of weeks  it happens again.  Are you a boy or are you a girl   Familiar silence  but this time I'm ready  and I am about to go all Women's Studies     on this table.  Laughter  I've got my Betty Friedan quotes. I've got my Gloria Steinem quotes. I've even got this little bit from  Vagina Monologues  I'm going to do. So I take a deep breath and I look down and staring back at me is a four year old girl in a pink dress  not a challenge to a feminist duel  just a kid with a question   Are you a boy or are you a girl   So I take another deep breath  squat down to next to her  and say   Hey  I know it's kind of confusing. My hair is short like a boy's  and I wear boy's clothes  but I'm a girl  and you know how sometimes you like to wear a pink dress  and sometimes you like to wear your comfy jammies  Well  I'm more of a comfy jammies kind of girl.  And this kid looks me dead in the eye  without missing a beat  and says   My favorite pajamas are purple with fish. Can I get a pancake  please   And that was it. Just   Oh  okay. You're a girl. How about that pancake   It was the easiest hard conversation I have ever had. And why  Because Pancake Girl and I  we were both real with each other. So like many of us  I've lived in a few closets in my life  and yeah  most often  my walls happened to be rainbow. But inside  in the dark  you can't tell what color the walls are. You just know what it feels like to live in a closet. So really  my closet is no different than yours or yours or yours. Sure  I'll give you     reasons why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours  but here's the thing  Hard is not relative. Hard is hard. Who can tell me that explaining to someone you've just declared bankruptcy is harder than telling someone you just cheated on them  Who can tell me that his coming out story is harder than telling your five year old  you're getting a divorce  There is no harder  there is just hard. We need to stop ranking our hard against everyone else's hard to make us feel better or worse about our closets and just commiserate on the  fact that we all have hard. At some point in our lives  we all live in closets  and they may feel safe  or at least safer than what lies on the other side of that door. But I am here to tell you  no matter what your walls are made of  a closet is no place for a person to live. Thanks.  Applause  So imagine yourself    years ago. Me  I had a ponytail  a strapless dress  and high heeled shoes. I was not the militant lesbian ready to fight any four year old that walked into the cafe. I was frozen by fear  curled up in the corner of my pitch black closet clutching my gay grenade  and moving one muscle is the scariest thing I have ever done. My family  my friends  complete strangers    I had spent my entire life trying to not disappoint these people  and now I was turning the world upside down on purpose. I was burning the pages of the script we had all followed for so long  but if you do not throw that grenade  it will kill you. One of my most memorable grenade tosses was at my sister's wedding. It was the first time that many in attendance knew I was gay  so in doing  my maid of honor duties  in my black dress and heels  I walked around to tables and finally landed on a table of my parents' friends  folks that had known me for years. And after a little small talk  one of the women shouted out   I love Nathan Lane   And the battle of gay relatability had begun.  Ash  have you ever been to the Castro    Well  yeah  actually  we have friends in San Francisco.   Well  we've never been there but we've heard it's fabulous.   Ash  do you know my hairdresser Antonio  He's really good and he has never talked about a girlfriend.   Ash  what's your favorite TV show  Our favorite TV show  Favorite  Will   Grace. And you know who we love  Jack. Jack is our favorite.  And then one woman  stumped but wanting so desperately to show her support  to let me know she was on my side  she finally blurted out   Well  sometimes my husband wears pink shirts.  And I had a choice in that moment  as all grenade throwers do. I could go back to my girlfriend and my gay loving table and mock their responses  chastise their unworldliness and their inability to jump through the politically correct  gay hoops I had brought with me  or I could empathize with them and realize that that was maybe one of the hardest things they had ever done  that starting and having that conversation was them coming out of their closets. Sure  it would have been easy to point out where they felt short. It's a lot harder to meet them where they are and acknowledge the fact that they were trying. And what else can you ask someone to do but try  If you're going to be real with someone  you gotta be ready for real in return. So hard conversations are still not my strong suit. Ask anybody I have ever dated. But I'm getting better  and I follow what I like to call the three Pancake Girl principles. Now  please view this through gay colored lenses  but know what it takes to come out of any closet is essentially the same. Number one  Be authentic. Take the armor off. Be yourself. That kid in the cafe had no armor  but I was ready for battle. If you want someone to be real with you  they need to know that you bleed too. Number two  Be direct. Just say it. Rip the Band Aid off. If you know you are gay  just say it. If you tell your parents you might be gay  they will hold out hope that this will change. Do not give them that sense of false hope. And number three  and most important    Be unapologetic. You are speaking your truth. Never apologize for that. And some folks may have gotten hurt along the way  so sure  apologize for what you've done  but never apologize for who you are. And yeah  some folks may be disappointed  but that is on them  not on you. Those are their expectations of who you are  not yours. That is their story  not yours. The only story that matters is the one that you want to write. So the next time you find yourself in a pitch black closet clutching your grenade  know we have all been there before. And you may feel so very alone  but you are not. And we know it's hard but we need you out here  no matter what your walls are made of  because I guarantee you there are others peering through the keyholes of their closets looking for the next brave soul to bust a door open  so be that person and show the world that we are bigger than our closets and that a closet is no place for a person to truly live. Thank you  Boulder. Enjoy your night.  Applause  I'm very pleased to be here today to talk to you all about how we might repair the damaged brain  and I'm particularly excited by this field  because as a neurologist myself  I believe that this offers one of the great ways that we might be able to offer hope for patients who today live with devastating and yet untreatable diseases of the brain. So here's the problem. You can see here the picture of somebody's brain with Alzheimer's disease next to a healthy brain  and what's obvious is  in the Alzheimer's brain  ringed red  there's obvious damage    atrophy  scarring. And I could show you equivalent pictures from other disease  multiple sclerosis  motor neuron disease  Parkinson's disease  even Huntington's disease  and they would all tell a similar story. And collectively these brain disorders represent one of the major public health threats of our time. And the numbers here are really rather staggering. At any one time  there are    million people today living with one of these brain diseases  and the annual cost globally is     billion dollars. I mean  just think about that. That's greater than one percent of the global GDP. And it gets worse  because all these numbers are rising because these are by and large age related diseases  and we're living longer. So the question we really need to ask ourselves is  why  given the devastating impact of these diseases to the individual  never mind the scale of the societal problem  why are there no effective treatments  Now in order to consider this  I first need to give you a crash course in how the brain works. So in other words  I need to tell you everything I learned at medical school. But believe me  this isn't going to take very long. Okay   Laughter  So the brain is terribly simple  it's made up of four cells  and two of them are shown here. There's the nerve cell  and then there's the myelinating cell  or the insulating cell. It's called oligodendrocyte. And when these four cells work together in health and harmony  they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity  and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think  to emote  to remember  to learn  move  feel and so on. But equally  each of these individual four cells alone or together  can go rogue or die  and when that happens  you get damage. You get damaged wiring. You get disrupted connections. And that's evident here with the slower conduction. But ultimately  this damage will manifest as disease  clearly. And if the starting dying nerve cell is a motor nerve  for example  you'll get motor neuron disease. So I'd like to give you a real life illustration of what happens with motor neuron disease. So this is a patient of mine called John. John I saw just last week in the clinic. And I've asked John to tell us something  about what were his problems that led to the initial diagnosis of motor neuron disease. John  I was diagnosed in October in       and the main problem was a breathing problem  difficulty breathing. Siddharthan Chandran  I don't know if you caught all of that  but what John was telling us was that difficulty with breathing led eventually to the diagnosis of motor neuron disease. So John's now    months further down in that journey  and I've now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament. John  What I've got now is  the breathing's gotten worse. I've got weakness in my hands   my arms and my legs. So basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time. SC  John's just told us he's in a wheelchair most of the time. So what these two clips show is not just the devastating consequence of the disease  but they also tell us something about the shocking pace of the disease  because in just    months  a fit adult man has been rendered wheelchair  and respirator dependent. And let's face it  John could be anybody's father  brother or friend. So that's what happens when the motor nerve dies. But what happens when that myelin cell dies  You get multiple sclerosis. So the scan on your left is an illustration of the brain  and it's a map of the connections of the brain  and superimposed upon which are areas of damage. We call them lesions of demyelination. But they're damage  and they're white. So I know what you're thinking here. You're thinking   My God  this bloke came up and said he's going to talk about hope  and all he's done is give a really rather bleak and depressing tale.  I've told you these diseases are terrible. They're devastating  numbers are rising  the costs are ridiculous  and worst of all  we have no treatment. Where's the hope  Well  you know what  I think there is hope. And there's hope in this next section  of this brain section of somebody else with M.S.  because what it illustrates is  amazingly  the brain can repair itself. It just doesn't do it well enough. And so again  there are two things I want to show you. First of all is the damage of this patient with M.S. And again  it's another one of these white masses. But crucially  the area that's ringed red highlights an area that is pale blue. But that area that is pale blue was once white. So it was damaged. It's now repaired. Just to be clear  It's not because of doctors. It's in spite of doctors  not because of doctors. This is spontaneous repair. It's amazing and it's occurred because there are stem cells in the brain  even  which can enable new myelin  new insulation  to be laid down over the damaged nerves. And this observation is important for two reasons. The first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies that we learnt at medical school  or at least I did  admittedly last century  which is that the brain doesn't repair itself  unlike  say  the bone or the liver. But actually it does  but it just doesn't do it well enough. And the second thing it does  and it gives us a very clear direction  of travel for new therapies    I mean  you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know what to do here. You simply need to find ways of promoting the endogenous  spontaneous repair that occurs anyway. So the question is  why  if we've known that for some time  as we have  why do we not have those treatments  And that in part reflects the complexity of drug development. Now  drug development you might think of as a rather expensive but risky bet  and the odds of this bet are roughly this  they're        to one against  because you need to screen about        compounds to find that one potential winner. And then you need to spend    years and spend over a billion dollars  and even then  you may not have a winner. So the question for us is  can you change the rules of the game and can you shorten the odds  And in order to do that  you have to think  where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery  And one of the bottlenecks is  early in drug discovery. All that screening occurs in animal models. But we know that the proper  study of mankind is man  to borrow from Alexander Pope. So the question is  can we study these diseases using human material  And of course  absolutely we can. We can use stem cells  and specifically we can use human stem cells. And human stem cells are these extraordinary but simple cells that can do two things  they can self renew or make more of themselves  but they can also become specialized to make bone  liver or  crucially  nerve cells  maybe even the motor nerve cell or the myelin cell. And the challenge has long been  can we harness the power  the undoubted power of these stem cells in order to realize their promise for regenerative neurology  And I think we can now  and the reason we can is because there have been several major discoveries in the last        years. One of them was here in Edinburgh  and it must be the only celebrity sheep  Dolly. So Dolly was made in Edinburgh  and Dolly was an example of the first cloning of a mammal from an adult cell. But I think the even more significant breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today was made in      by a Japanese scientist called Yamanaka. And what Yamaka did  in a fantastic form of scientific cookery  was he showed that four ingredients  just four ingredients  could effectively convert any cell  adult cell  into a master stem cell. And the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate  because what it means that from anybody in this room  but particularly patients  you could now generate a bespoke  personalized tissue repair kit. Take a skin cell  make it a master pluripotent cell  so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their disease  both to study but potentially to treat. Now  the idea of that at medical school    this is a recurring theme  isn't  it  me and medical school    would have been ridiculous  but it's an absolute reality today. And I see this as the cornerstone of regeneration  repair and hope. And whilst we're on the theme of hope  for those of you who might have failed at school  there's hope for you as well  because this is the school report of John Gerdon.   I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist  on his present showing this is quite ridiculous.   So they didn't think much of him then. But what you may not know is that he  got the Nobel Prize for medicine just three months ago. So to return to the original problem  what is the opportunity of these stem cells  or this disruptive technology  for repairing the damaged brain  which we call regenerative neurology  I think there are two ways you can think about this  as a fantastic   st century drug discovery tool  and or as a form of therapy. So I want to tell you a little bit about both of those in the next few moments. Drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this. It's very simple  You take a patient with a disease  let's say motor neuron disease  you take a skin sample  you do the pluripotent reprogramming  as I've already told you  and you generate live motor nerve cells. That's straightforward  because that's what pluripotent cells can do. But crucially  you can then compare their behavior to their equivalent but healthy counterparts  ideally from an unaffected relative. That way  you're matching for genetic variation. And that's exactly what we did here. This was a collaboration with colleagues  in London  Chris Shaw  in the U.S.   Steve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis. And what you're looking at  and this is amazing  these are living  growing  motor nerve cells from a patient with motor neuron disease. It happens to be an inherited form. I mean  just imagine that. This would have been unimaginable    years ago. So apart from seeing them grow and put out processes  we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce  but crucially  we can then track their individual health and compare the diseased motor nerve cells to the healthy ones. And when you do all that and put it together  you realize that the diseased ones  which is represented in the red line  are two and a half times more likely to die than the healthy counterpart. And the crucial point about this is that you then have a fantastic assay to discover drugs  because what would you ask of the drugs  and you could do this through a high throughput automated screening system  you'd ask the drugs  give me one thing  find me a drug that will bring the red line closer to the blue line  because that drug will be a high value candidate that you could probably take direct to human trial and almost bypass that bottleneck that I've told you about in drug discovery with the animal models  if that makes sense. It's fantastic. But I want to come back to how you might use stem cells directly to repair damage. And again there are two ways to think about this  and they're not mutually exclusive. The first  and I think in the long run the one that will give us the biggest dividend  but it's not thought of that way just yet  is to think about those stem cells that are already in your brain  and I've told you that. All of us have stem cells in the brain  even the diseased brain  and surely the smart way forward is to find ways that you can promote and activate those stem cells in your brain already to react and respond appropriately to damage to repair it. That will be the future. There will be drugs that will do that. But the other way is to effectively parachute in cells  transplant them in  to replace dying or lost cells  even in the brain. And I want to tell you now an experiment  it's a clinical trial that we did  which recently completed  which is with colleagues in UCL  David Miller in particular. So this study was very simple. We took patients with multiple sclerosis and asked a simple question  Would stem cells from the bone marrow be protective of their nerves  So what we did was we took this bone marrow  grew up the stem cells in the lab  and then injected them back into the vein. I'm making this sound really simple. It took five years off a lot of people  okay  And it put gray hair on me and caused all kinds of issues. But conceptually  it's essentially simple. So we've given them into the vein  right  So in order to measure whether this was successful or not  we measured the optic nerve as our outcome measure. And that's a good thing to measure in M.S.  because patients with M.S. sadly suffer with problems with vision    loss of vision  unclear vision. And so we measured the size of the optic nerve using the scans with David Miller three times       months  six months  and before the infusion    and you can see the gently declining red line. And that's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking  which makes sense  because their nerves are dying. We then gave the stem cell infusion and repeated the measurement twice    three months and six months    and to our surprise  almost  the line's gone up. That suggests that the intervention has been protective. I don't think myself that what's happened is that those stem cells have made new myelin or new nerves. What I think they've done is they've promoted the endogenous stem cells  or precursor cells  to do their job  wake up  lay down new myelin. So this is a proof of concept. I'm very excited about that. So I just want to end with the theme I began on  which was regeneration and hope. So here I've asked John what his hopes are for the future. John  I would hope that sometime in the future through the research that you people are doing  we can come up with a cure so that people like me can lead a normal life. SC  I mean  that speaks volumes. But I'd like to close by first of all thanking John    thanking John for allowing me to share his insights and these clips with you all. But I'd also like to add to John and to others that my own view is  I'm hopeful for the future. I do believe that the disruptive technologies like stem cells that I've tried to explain to you do offer very real hope. And I do think that the day that we might be able to repair the damaged brain is sooner than we think. Thank you. I'm going to talk about hackers. And the image that comes to your mind when I say that word is probably not of Benjamin Franklin  but I'm going to explain to you why it should be. The image that comes to your mind is probably more likely of a pasty kid sitting in a basement doing something mischievous  or of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity  or of an international rogue with a political agenda. And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of. But like most things in technology and the technology world  hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil. For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity there's one that's building a tool that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor environmental quality after an oil spill. Hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system  and it is a deeply democratic activity. It's about critical thinking. It's about questioning existing ways of doing things. It's the idea that if you see a  problem  you work to fix it  and not just complain about it. And in many ways  hacking is what built America. Betsy Ross was a hacker. The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack. And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs  hacking has always been at the foundation of American democracy. So if there's one thing I want to leave you here with today  it's that the next time you think about who a hacker is  you think not of this guy but of this guy  Benjamin Franklin  who was one of the greatest hackers of all time. He was one of America's most prolific inventors  though he famously never filed a patent  because he thought that all human knowledge should be freely available. He brought us bifocals and the lightning rod  and of course there was his collaboration on the invention of American democracy. And in Code For America  we really try to embody the spirit of Ben Franklin. He was a tinkerer and a statesman whose conception of citizenship was always predicated on action. He believed that government could be built by the people  and we call those people civic hackers. So it's no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy  like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise  are the same values that underly the Internet. And so it's no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government. But before I give you a few examples of what civic hacking looks like  I want to make clear that you don't have to be a programmer to be a civic hacker. You just have to believe that you can bring a   st century tool set to bear on the problems that government faces. And we hear all the time from our community of civic hackers at Code for America that they didn't understand how much nontechnical work actually went into civic hacking projects. So keep that in mind. All of you are potential civic hackers. So what does civic hacking look like  Our team last year in Honolulu  which in this case was three full time fellows who were doing a year of public service  were asked by the city to rebuild the website. And it's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just wasn't going to be possible in the few months that they had. So instead  they decided to build a parallel site that better conformed to how citizens actually want to interact with information on a city website. They're looking for answers to questions  and they want to take action when they're done  which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this. So our team built Honolulu Answers  which is a super simple search interface where you enter a search term or a question and get back plain language answers that drive a user towards action. Now the site itself was easy enough to build  but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content. It would have taken the three of them a very long time  especially given that none of  them are actually from Honolulu. And so they did something that's really radical  when you think about how government is used to working. They asked citizens to write the content. So you've heard of a hack a thon. They held a write a thon  where on one Saturday afternoon    Wild pigs are a huge problem  in Honolulu  apparently. In one Saturday afternoon  they were able to populate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions  but more importantly than that  they created a new way for citizens  to participate in their government. Now  I think this is a really cool story in and of itself  but it gets more awesome. On the National Day of Civic Hacking this past June in Oakland  where I live  the Code For America team in Oakland took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers and turned it into Oakland Answers  and again we held a write a thon where we took the most frequently asked questions and had citizens write the answers to them  and I got into the act. I authored this answer  and a few others. And I'm trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation. And by stitching together my small act with the thousands of other small acts of participation that we're enabling through civic hacking  we think we can reenergize citizenship and restore trust in government. At this point  you may be wondering what city officials think of all this. They actually love it. As most of you guys know  cities are being asked every day to do more with less  and they're always looking for innovative solutions to entrenched problems. So when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting  cities can actually capture the capacity in their communities to do the business of government. Now I don't want to leave the impression that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon. It's happening across the globe  and one of my favorite examples is from Mexico City  where earlier this year  the Mexico House of Representatives entered into a contract with a software development firm to build an app that legislators would use to track bills. So this was just for the handful of legislators in the House. And the contract was a two year contract for  .  million dollars. Now a lot of people were really angry about this  especially geeks who knew that  .  million dollars was an absolutely outrageous amount of money for what was a very simple app. But instead of taking to the streets  they issued a challenge. They asked programmers in Mexico to build something better and cheaper  and they offered a prize of       dollars           times cheaper than the government contract  and they gave the entrants    days. And in those    days  they submitted     apps  five of which were presented to Congress and are still in the app store today. And because of this action  that contract was vacated  and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City which is home to one of our partners  Code for Mexico City. And so what you see in all three of these places  in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City  are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking. It's citizens who saw things that could be working better and they decided to fix them  and through that work  they're creating a   st century ecosystem of participation. They're creating a whole new set of ways for citizens to be involved  besides voting or signing a petition or protesting. They can actually build government. So back to our friend Ben Franklin  who  one of his lesser known accomplishments was that in      he founded the first volunteer firefighting company in Philadelphia  called a brigade. And it's because he and his friends noticed that the city was having trouble keeping up with all the fires that were happening in the city  so in true civic hacker fashion  they built a solution. And we have our own brigades at Code for America working on the projects that I've just described  and we want to ask you to follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps and come join us. We have    brigades in the U.S. We are pleased to announce today that we're opening up the  brigade to international cities for the first time  starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland. You can find out if there's a brigade where you live at brigade.codeforamerica.org  and if there's not a brigade where you live  we will help you. We've created a tool kit which also lives at brigade.codeforamerica.org  and we will support you along the way. Our goal is to create a global network of civic hackers who are innovating on the existing system in order to build tools that will solve entrenched problems  that will support local government  and that will empower citizens. So please come hack with us. Thank you. Thirteen years ago  we set ourselves a goal to end poverty. After some success  we've hit a big hurdle. The aftermath of the financial crisis has begun to hit aid payments  which have fallen for two consecutive years. My question is whether the lessons learned from saving the financial system can be used to help us overcome that hurdle and help millions. Can we simply print money for aid   Surely not.  It's a common reaction. It's a quick talk. Others channel John McEnroe.  You cannot be serious   Now  I can't do the accent  but I am serious  thanks to these two children  who  as you'll learn  are very much at the heart of my talk. On the left  we have Pia. She lives in England. She has two loving parents  one of whom is standing right here. Dorothy  on the right  lives in rural Kenya. She's one of        orphans and vulnerable children who are assisted by a charity that I support. I do that because I believe that Dorothy  like Pia  deserves the best life chances that we can afford to give her. You'll all agree with me  I'm sure. The U.N. agrees too. Their overriding aim for international aid is to strive for a life of dignity for all. But    and here's that hurdle    can we afford our aid aspirations  History suggests not. In       governments set themselves a target to increase overseas aid payments to  .  percent of their national income. As you can see  a big gap opens up between actual aid and that target. But then come the Millennium Development Goals  eight ambitious targets to be met by     . If I tell you that just one of those targets is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty  you get a sense of the ambition. There's also been some success. The number of people living on less than   .   a day has halved. But a lot remains to be done in two years. One in eight remain hungry. In the context of this auditorium  the front two rows aren't going to get any food. We can't settle for that  which is why the concern about the eighth goal  which relates to funding  which I said at the beginning is falling  is so troubling. So what can be done  Well  I work in financial markets  not development. I study the behavior of investors  how they react to policy and the economy. It gives me a different angle on the aid issue. But it took an innocent question from my then four year old daughter to make me appreciate that. Pia and I were on the way to a local cafe and we passed a man collecting for charity. I didn't have any change to give him  and she was disappointed. Once in the cafe  Pia takes out her coloring book and starts scribbling. After a little while  I ask her what she's doing  and she shows me a drawing of a    note to give to the man outside. It's so sweet  and more generous than Dad would have been. But of course I explained to her   You can't do that  it's not allowed.  To which I get the classic four year old response   Why not   Now I'm excited  because I actually think I can answer this time. So I launch into an explanation of how an unlimited supply of money chasing a limited number of goods sends prices to the moon. Something about that exchange stuck with me  not because of the look of relief on Pia's face when I finally finished  but because it related to the sanctity of the money supply  a sanctity that had been challenged and questioned by the reaction of central banks to the financial crisis. To reassure investors  central banks began buying assets to try and encourage investors to do the same. They funded these purchases with money they created themselves. The money wasn't actually physically printed. It's still sort of locked away in the banking system today. But the amount created was unprecedented. Together  the central banks of the U.S.  U.K and Japan increased the stock of money in their economies by  .  trillion dollars. That's three times  in fact that's more than three times  the total physical stock of dollar notes in circulation. Three times  Before the crisis  this would have been utterly unthinkable  yet it was accepted remarkably quickly. The price of gold  an asset thought to protect against inflation  did jump  but investors bought other assets that offered little protection from inflation. They bought fixed income securities  bonds. They bought equities too. For all the scare stories  the actual actions of investors spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence. That confidence was based on two pillars. The first was that  after years of keeping inflation under control  central banks were trusted to take the money printing away if inflation became a threat. Secondly  inflation simply never became a threat. As you can see  in the United States  inflation for most of this period remained below average. It was the same elsewhere. So how does all this relate to aid  Well  this is where Dorothy and the Mango Tree charity that supports her comes in. I was at one of their fundraising events earlier this year  and I was inspired to give a one off donation when I remembered that my firm offers to match the charitable contributions its employees make. So think of this  Instead of just being able to help Dorothy and four of her classmates to go through secondary school for a few years  I was able to double my contribution. Brilliant. So following that conversation with my daughter  and seeing the absence of inflation in the face of money printing  and knowing that international aid payments were falling at just the wrong time  this made me wonder  Could we match but just on a much grander scale  Let's call this scheme  Print Aid.  And here's how it might work. Provided it saw little inflation risk from doing so  the central bank would be mandated to match the government's overseas aid payments up to a certain limit. Governments have been aiming to get aid to  .  percent for years  so let's set the limit at half of that   .   percent of their income. So it would work like this  If in a given year the government gave  .  percent of its income to overseas aid  the central bank would simply top it up with a further  .  percent. So far so good. How risky is this  Well  this involves the creation of money to buy goods  not assets. It sounds more inflationary already  doesn't it. But there are two important mitigating factors here. The first is that by definition  this money printed would be spent overseas. So it's not obvious how it leads to inflation in the country doing the actual printing unless it leads to a currency depreciation of that country. That is unlikely for the second reason  the scale of the money that would be printed under this scheme. So let's think of an example where Print Aid was in place in the U.S.  U.K. and Japan. To match the aid payments made by those governments over the last four years  Print Aid would have generated     billion dollars' worth of extra aid. What would that look like in the context of the increase in the money stock that had already happened in those countries to save the financial system  Are you read for this  You might struggle to see that at the back  because the gap is quite small. So what we're saying here is that we took a   .  trillion gamble to save our financial systems  and you know what  it paid off. There was no inflation. Are we really saying that it's not worth the risk to print an extra     billion for aid  Would the risks really be that different  To me  it's not that clear. What is clear is the impact on aid. Even though this is the printing of just three central banks  the global aid that's given over this period is up by almost    percent. Aid as a proportion of national income all of a sudden is at a    year high. Now  we don't get to  .  percent. Governments are still incentivized to give. But you know what  that's the  point of a matching scheme. So I think what we've learned is that the risks from this money creation scheme are quite modest  but the benefits are potentially huge. Imagine what we could do with    percent more funding. We might be able to feed the front row. The thing that I fear  the only thing that I fear  apart from the fact that I've run out of time  is that the window of opportunity for this idea is a short one. Today  money creation by central banks is an accepted policy tool. That may not always be the case. Today there are universally agreed aims for international aid. That may not always be the case. Today might be the only time that these two things coincide  such that we can afford the aid that we've always aspired to give. So  can we print money for international aid  I seriously believe the question should be  why not  Thank you very much. Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies  bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars  but collections of stars  or galaxies. Now  by showing you some of these images  I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects  but more than that  I think galaxy clusters are mysterious  they are surprising  and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories  to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types  and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So  how big  Well  here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent  it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And  in fact  if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now  to give you a number  this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind boggling how  massive these systems can get. But more than their mass  they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems  so if we like  we can think of them as a scaled down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales  such as  how does gravity work  might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay  if I take an image of a galaxy cluster  and I subtract away all of the starlight  what I'm left with is this big  blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X ray light that we're seeing. And the question is  if it's not galaxies  what is emitting this light  The answer is hot gas  million degree gas    in fact  it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds  and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea  but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us  still puzzle us  and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing  probing the very small. Now  to explain this  I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something  very  very mysterious  which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that  doesn't like to interact very much  except through gravity  and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist  you want to know what happens  when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well  how do we do this  To answer that question  I'm going to have to ask another one  which is  what happens when galaxy clusters collide  Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe  scaled down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter  and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas  and  of course  you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge  huge scale. And this is very important  because what it means is that very  very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab  might be compounded and compounded into something that we could  possibly observe in nature. So  it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter  the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small  is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing  the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay  if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air  I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever increasing rate. Similarly  cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name  and they call it dark energy. And  again  we want to learn more about it. So  one particular question that we have is  how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales  Depending on how strong it is  maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well  the problem with the large scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well  I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic  the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly  I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So  as I come to a close  you might feel slightly cheated. I mean  I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful  and I've given some reasons  but what is their use really  Well  to answer this  I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say   If I had asked people what they wanted  they would have said faster horses.  Today  we as a society are faced with many  many difficult problems. And the solutions to these  problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So  yes  we need to focus  yes  we need to concentrate  but we also need to remember that innovation  ingenuity  inspiration    these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. I'm very pleased to be here today to talk to you all about how we might repair the damaged brain  and I'm particularly excited by this field  because as a neurologist myself  I believe that this offers one of the great ways that we might be able to offer hope for patients who today live with devastating and yet untreatable diseases of the brain. So here's the problem. You can see here the picture of somebody's brain with Alzheimer's disease next to a healthy brain  and what's obvious is  in the Alzheimer's brain  ringed red  there's obvious damage    atrophy  scarring. And I could show you equivalent pictures from other disease  multiple sclerosis  motor neuron disease  Parkinson's disease  even Huntington's disease  and they would all tell a similar story. And collectively these brain disorders represent one of the major public health threats of our time. And the numbers here are really rather staggering. At any one time  there are    million people today living with one of these brain diseases  and the annual cost globally is     billion dollars. I mean  just think about that. That's greater than one percent of the global GDP. And it gets worse  because all these numbers are rising because these are by and large age related diseases  and we're living longer. So the question we really need to ask ourselves is  why  given the devastating impact of these diseases to the individual  never mind the scale of the societal problem  why are there no effective treatments  Now in order to consider this  I first need to give you a crash course in how the brain works. So in other words  I need to tell you everything I learned at medical school. But believe me  this isn't going to take very long. Okay   Laughter  So the brain is terribly simple  it's made up of four cells  and two of them are shown here. There's the nerve cell  and then there's the myelinating cell  or the insulating cell. It's called oligodendrocyte. And when these four cells work together in health and harmony  they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity  and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think  to emote  to remember  to learn  move  feel and so on. But equally  each of these individual four cells alone or together  can go rogue or die  and when that happens  you get damage. You get damaged wiring. You get disrupted connections. And that's evident here with the slower conduction. But ultimately  this damage will manifest as disease  clearly. And if the starting dying nerve cell is a motor nerve  for example  you'll get motor neuron disease. So I'd like to give you a real life illustration of what happens with motor neuron disease. So this is a patient of mine called John. John I saw just last week in the clinic. And I've asked John to tell us something  about what were his problems that led to the initial diagnosis of motor neuron disease. John  I was diagnosed in October in       and the main problem was a breathing problem  difficulty breathing. Siddharthan Chandran  I don't know if you caught all of that  but what John was telling us was that difficulty with breathing led eventually to the diagnosis of motor neuron disease. So John's now    months further down in that journey  and I've now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament. John  What I've got now is  the breathing's gotten worse. I've got weakness in my hands   my arms and my legs. So basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time. SC  John's just told us he's in a wheelchair most of the time. So what these two clips show is not just the devastating consequence of the disease  but they also tell us something about the shocking pace of the disease  because in just    months  a fit adult man has been rendered wheelchair  and respirator dependent. And let's face it  John could be anybody's father  brother or friend. So that's what happens when the motor nerve dies. But what happens when that myelin cell dies  You get multiple sclerosis. So the scan on your left is an illustration of the brain  and it's a map of the connections of the brain  and superimposed upon which are areas of damage. We call them lesions of demyelination. But they're damage  and they're white. So I know what you're thinking here. You're thinking   My God  this bloke came up and said he's going to talk about hope  and all he's done is give a really rather bleak and depressing tale.  I've told you these diseases are terrible. They're devastating  numbers are rising  the costs are ridiculous  and worst of all  we have no treatment. Where's the hope  Well  you know what  I think there is hope. And there's hope in this next section  of this brain section of somebody else with M.S.  because what it illustrates is  amazingly  the brain can repair itself. It just doesn't do it well enough. And so again  there are two things I want to show you. First of all is the damage of this patient with M.S. And again  it's another one of these white masses. But crucially  the area that's ringed red highlights an area that is pale blue. But that area that is pale blue was once white. So it was damaged. It's now repaired. Just to be clear  It's not because of doctors. It's in spite of doctors  not because of doctors. This is spontaneous repair. It's amazing and it's occurred because there are stem cells in the brain  even  which can enable new myelin  new insulation  to be laid down over the damaged nerves. And this observation is important for two reasons. The first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies that we learnt at medical school  or at least I did  admittedly last century  which is that the brain doesn't repair itself  unlike  say  the bone or the liver. But actually it does  but it just doesn't do it well enough. And the second thing it does  and it gives us a very clear direction  of travel for new therapies    I mean  you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know what to do here. You simply need to find ways of promoting the endogenous  spontaneous repair that occurs anyway. So the question is  why  if we've known that for some time  as we have  why do we not have those treatments  And that in part reflects the complexity of drug development. Now  drug development you might think of as a rather expensive but risky bet  and the odds of this bet are roughly this  they're        to one against  because you need to screen about        compounds to find that one potential winner. And then you need to spend    years and spend over a billion dollars  and even then  you may not have a winner. So the question for us is  can you change the rules of the game and can you shorten the odds  And in order to do that  you have to think  where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery  And one of the bottlenecks is  early in drug discovery. All that screening occurs in animal models. But we know that the proper  study of mankind is man  to borrow from Alexander Pope. So the question is  can we study these diseases using human material  And of course  absolutely we can. We can use stem cells  and specifically we can use human stem cells. And human stem cells are these extraordinary but simple cells that can do two things  they can self renew or make more of themselves  but they can also become specialized to make bone  liver or  crucially  nerve cells  maybe even the motor nerve cell or the myelin cell. And the challenge has long been  can we harness the power  the undoubted power of these stem cells in order to realize their promise for regenerative neurology  And I think we can now  and the reason we can is because there have been several major discoveries in the last        years. One of them was here in Edinburgh  and it must be the only celebrity sheep  Dolly. So Dolly was made in Edinburgh  and Dolly was an example of the first cloning of a mammal from an adult cell. But I think the even more significant breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today was made in      by a Japanese scientist called Yamanaka. And what Yamaka did  in a fantastic form of scientific cookery  was he showed that four ingredients  just four ingredients  could effectively convert any cell  adult cell  into a master stem cell. And the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate  because what it means that from anybody in this room  but particularly patients  you could now generate a bespoke  personalized tissue repair kit. Take a skin cell  make it a master pluripotent cell  so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their disease  both to study but potentially to treat. Now  the idea of that at medical school    this is a recurring theme  isn't  it  me and medical school    would have been ridiculous  but it's an absolute reality today. And I see this as the cornerstone of regeneration  repair and hope. And whilst we're on the theme of hope  for those of you who might have failed at school  there's hope for you as well  because this is the school report of John Gerdon.   I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist  on his present showing this is quite ridiculous.   So they didn't think much of him then. But what you may not know is that he  got the Nobel Prize for medicine just three months ago. So to return to the original problem  what is the opportunity of these stem cells  or this disruptive technology  for repairing the damaged brain  which we call regenerative neurology  I think there are two ways you can think about this  as a fantastic   st century drug discovery tool  and or as a form of therapy. So I want to tell you a little bit about both of those in the next few moments. Drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this. It's very simple  You take a patient with a disease  let's say motor neuron disease  you take a skin sample  you do the pluripotent reprogramming  as I've already told you  and you generate live motor nerve cells. That's straightforward  because that's what pluripotent cells can do. But crucially  you can then compare their behavior to their equivalent but healthy counterparts  ideally from an unaffected relative. That way  you're matching for genetic variation. And that's exactly what we did here. This was a collaboration with colleagues  in London  Chris Shaw  in the U.S.   Steve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis. And what you're looking at  and this is amazing  these are living  growing  motor nerve cells from a patient with motor neuron disease. It happens to be an inherited form. I mean  just imagine that. This would have been unimaginable    years ago. So apart from seeing them grow and put out processes  we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce  but crucially  we can then track their individual health and compare the diseased motor nerve cells to the healthy ones. And when you do all that and put it together  you realize that the diseased ones  which is represented in the red line  are two and a half times more likely to die than the healthy counterpart. And the crucial point about this is that you then have a fantastic assay to discover drugs  because what would you ask of the drugs  and you could do this through a high throughput automated screening system  you'd ask the drugs  give me one thing  find me a drug that will bring the red line closer to the blue line  because that drug will be a high value candidate that you could probably take direct to human trial and almost bypass that bottleneck that I've told you about in drug discovery with the animal models  if that makes sense. It's fantastic. But I want to come back to how you might use stem cells directly to repair damage. And again there are two ways to think about this  and they're not mutually exclusive. The first  and I think in the long run the one that will give us the biggest dividend  but it's not thought of that way just yet  is to think about those stem cells that are already in your brain  and I've told you that. All of us have stem cells in the brain  even the diseased brain  and surely the smart way forward is to find ways that you can promote and activate those stem cells in your brain already to react and respond appropriately to damage to repair it. That will be the future. There will be drugs that will do that. But the other way is to effectively parachute in cells  transplant them in  to replace dying or lost cells  even in the brain. And I want to tell you now an experiment  it's a clinical trial that we did  which recently completed  which is with colleagues in UCL  David Miller in particular. So this study was very simple. We took patients with multiple sclerosis and asked a simple question  Would stem cells from the bone marrow be protective of their nerves  So what we did was we took this bone marrow  grew up the stem cells in the lab  and then injected them back into the vein. I'm making this sound really simple. It took five years off a lot of people  okay  And it put gray hair on me and caused all kinds of issues. But conceptually  it's essentially simple. So we've given them into the vein  right  So in order to measure whether this was successful or not  we measured the optic nerve as our outcome measure. And that's a good thing to measure in M.S.  because patients with M.S. sadly suffer with problems with vision    loss of vision  unclear vision. And so we measured the size of the optic nerve using the scans with David Miller three times       months  six months  and before the infusion    and you can see the gently declining red line. And that's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking  which makes sense  because their nerves are dying. We then gave the stem cell infusion and repeated the measurement twice    three months and six months    and to our surprise  almost  the line's gone up. That suggests that the intervention has been protective. I don't think myself that what's happened is that those stem cells have made new myelin or new nerves. What I think they've done is they've promoted the endogenous stem cells  or precursor cells  to do their job  wake up  lay down new myelin. So this is a proof of concept. I'm very excited about that. So I just want to end with the theme I began on  which was regeneration and hope. So here I've asked John what his hopes are for the future. John  I would hope that sometime in the future through the research that you people are doing  we can come up with a cure so that people like me can lead a normal life. SC  I mean  that speaks volumes. But I'd like to close by first of all thanking John    thanking John for allowing me to share his insights and these clips with you all. But I'd also like to add to John and to others that my own view is  I'm hopeful for the future. I do believe that the disruptive technologies like stem cells that I've tried to explain to you do offer very real hope. And I do think that the day that we might be able to repair the damaged brain is sooner than we think. Thank you. I'm going to talk about hackers. And the image that comes to your mind when I say that word is probably not of Benjamin Franklin  but I'm going to explain to you why it should be. The image that comes to your mind is probably more likely of a pasty kid sitting in a basement doing something mischievous  or of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity  or of an international rogue with a political agenda. And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of. But like most things in technology and the technology world  hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil. For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity there's one that's building a tool that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor environmental quality after an oil spill. Hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system  and it is a deeply democratic activity. It's about critical thinking. It's about questioning existing ways of doing things. It's the idea that if you see a  problem  you work to fix it  and not just complain about it. And in many ways  hacking is what built America. Betsy Ross was a hacker. The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack. And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs  hacking has always been at the foundation of American democracy. So if there's one thing I want to leave you here with today  it's that the next time you think about who a hacker is  you think not of this guy but of this guy  Benjamin Franklin  who was one of the greatest hackers of all time. He was one of America's most prolific inventors  though he famously never filed a patent  because he thought that all human knowledge should be freely available. He brought us bifocals and the lightning rod  and of course there was his collaboration on the invention of American democracy. And in Code For America  we really try to embody the spirit of Ben Franklin. He was a tinkerer and a statesman whose conception of citizenship was always predicated on action. He believed that government could be built by the people  and we call those people civic hackers. So it's no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy  like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise  are the same values that underly the Internet. And so it's no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government. But before I give you a few examples of what civic hacking looks like  I want to make clear that you don't have to be a programmer to be a civic hacker. You just have to believe that you can bring a   st century tool set to bear on the problems that government faces. And we hear all the time from our community of civic hackers at Code for America that they didn't understand how much nontechnical work actually went into civic hacking projects. So keep that in mind. All of you are potential civic hackers. So what does civic hacking look like  Our team last year in Honolulu  which in this case was three full time fellows who were doing a year of public service  were asked by the city to rebuild the website. And it's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just wasn't going to be possible in the few months that they had. So instead  they decided to build a parallel site that better conformed to how citizens actually want to interact with information on a city website. They're looking for answers to questions  and they want to take action when they're done  which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this. So our team built Honolulu Answers  which is a super simple search interface where you enter a search term or a question and get back plain language answers that drive a user towards action. Now the site itself was easy enough to build  but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content. It would have taken the three of them a very long time  especially given that none of  them are actually from Honolulu. And so they did something that's really radical  when you think about how government is used to working. They asked citizens to write the content. So you've heard of a hack a thon. They held a write a thon  where on one Saturday afternoon    Wild pigs are a huge problem  in Honolulu  apparently. In one Saturday afternoon  they were able to populate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions  but more importantly than that  they created a new way for citizens  to participate in their government. Now  I think this is a really cool story in and of itself  but it gets more awesome. On the National Day of Civic Hacking this past June in Oakland  where I live  the Code For America team in Oakland took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers and turned it into Oakland Answers  and again we held a write a thon where we took the most frequently asked questions and had citizens write the answers to them  and I got into the act. I authored this answer  and a few others. And I'm trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation. And by stitching together my small act with the thousands of other small acts of participation that we're enabling through civic hacking  we think we can reenergize citizenship and restore trust in government. At this point  you may be wondering what city officials think of all this. They actually love it. As most of you guys know  cities are being asked every day to do more with less  and they're always looking for innovative solutions to entrenched problems. So when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting  cities can actually capture the capacity in their communities to do the business of government. Now I don't want to leave the impression that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon. It's happening across the globe  and one of my favorite examples is from Mexico City  where earlier this year  the Mexico House of Representatives entered into a contract with a software development firm to build an app that legislators would use to track bills. So this was just for the handful of legislators in the House. And the contract was a two year contract for  .  million dollars. Now a lot of people were really angry about this  especially geeks who knew that  .  million dollars was an absolutely outrageous amount of money for what was a very simple app. But instead of taking to the streets  they issued a challenge. They asked programmers in Mexico to build something better and cheaper  and they offered a prize of       dollars           times cheaper than the government contract  and they gave the entrants    days. And in those    days  they submitted     apps  five of which were presented to Congress and are still in the app store today. And because of this action  that contract was vacated  and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City which is home to one of our partners  Code for Mexico City. And so what you see in all three of these places  in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City  are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking. It's citizens who saw things that could be working better and they decided to fix them  and through that work  they're creating a   st century ecosystem of participation. They're creating a whole new set of ways for citizens to be involved  besides voting or signing a petition or protesting. They can actually build government. So back to our friend Ben Franklin  who  one of his lesser known accomplishments was that in      he founded the first volunteer firefighting company in Philadelphia  called a brigade. And it's because he and his friends noticed that the city was having trouble keeping up with all the fires that were happening in the city  so in true civic hacker fashion  they built a solution. And we have our own brigades at Code for America working on the projects that I've just described  and we want to ask you to follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps and come join us. We have    brigades in the U.S. We are pleased to announce today that we're opening up the  brigade to international cities for the first time  starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland. You can find out if there's a brigade where you live at brigade.codeforamerica.org  and if there's not a brigade where you live  we will help you. We've created a tool kit which also lives at brigade.codeforamerica.org  and we will support you along the way. Our goal is to create a global network of civic hackers who are innovating on the existing system in order to build tools that will solve entrenched problems  that will support local government  and that will empower citizens. So please come hack with us. Thank you. Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies  bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars  but collections of stars  or galaxies. Now  by showing you some of these images  I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects  but more than that  I think galaxy clusters are mysterious  they are surprising  and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories  to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types  and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So  how big  Well  here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent  it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And  in fact  if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now  to give you a number  this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind boggling how  massive these systems can get. But more than their mass  they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems  so if we like  we can think of them as a scaled down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales  such as  how does gravity work  might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay  if I take an image of a galaxy cluster  and I subtract away all of the starlight  what I'm left with is this big  blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X ray light that we're seeing. And the question is  if it's not galaxies  what is emitting this light  The answer is hot gas  million degree gas    in fact  it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds  and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea  but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us  still puzzle us  and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing  probing the very small. Now  to explain this  I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something  very  very mysterious  which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that  doesn't like to interact very much  except through gravity  and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist  you want to know what happens  when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well  how do we do this  To answer that question  I'm going to have to ask another one  which is  what happens when galaxy clusters collide  Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe  scaled down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter  and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas  and  of course  you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge  huge scale. And this is very important  because what it means is that very  very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab  might be compounded and compounded into something that we could  possibly observe in nature. So  it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter  the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small  is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing  the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay  if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air  I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever increasing rate. Similarly  cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name  and they call it dark energy. And  again  we want to learn more about it. So  one particular question that we have is  how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales  Depending on how strong it is  maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well  the problem with the large scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well  I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic  the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly  I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So  as I come to a close  you might feel slightly cheated. I mean  I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful  and I've given some reasons  but what is their use really  Well  to answer this  I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say   If I had asked people what they wanted  they would have said faster horses.  Today  we as a society are faced with many  many difficult problems. And the solutions to these  problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So  yes  we need to focus  yes  we need to concentrate  but we also need to remember that innovation  ingenuity  inspiration    these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. Almost two years ago  I was driving in my car in Germany  and I turned on the radio. Europe at the time was in the middle of the Euro crisis  and all the headlines were about European countries getting downgraded by rating agencies in the United States. I listened and thought to myself   What are these rating agencies  and why is everybody so upset about their work   Well  if you were sitting next to me in the car that day and would have told me that I would devote the next years to trying to reform them  obviously I would have called you crazy. But guess what's really crazy  the way these rating agencies are run. And I would like to explain to you not only why it's time to change this  but also how we can do it. So let me tell you a little bit about what rating agencies really do. As you would read a car magazine before purchasing a new car or taking a look at a product review before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get  investors are reading ratings before they decide in which kind of product they are investing their money. A rating can range from a so called AAA  which means it's a top performing product  and it can go down to the level of the so called BBB   which means it's a fairly risky investment. Rating agencies are rating companies. They are rating banks. They are rating even financial products like the infamous mortgage backed securities. But they can also rate countries  and these ratings are called sovereign ratings  and I would like to focus in particular on these sovereign ratings. And I can tell  as you're listening to me right now  you're thinking  so why should I really care about this  right  Be honest. Well  ratings affect you. They affect all of us. If a rating agency rates a country  it basically assesses and evaluates a country's debt and the ability and willingness of a country to repay its debt. So if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency  the country has to pay more in order to borrow money on the international markets. So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer  because you and your fellow countrymen have to pony up more in order to borrow. But what if a country can't afford to pay more because it's maybe too expensive  Well  then the country has less available for other services  like roads  schools  healthcare. And this is the reason why you should care  because sovereign ratings affect everyone. And that is the reason why I believe they should be defined as public goods. They should be transparent  accessible  and available to everyone at no cost. But here's the situation  the rating agency market is dominated by three players and three players only    Standard   Poor's  Moody's  and Fitch    and we know whenever there is a market concentration  there is really no competition. There is no incentive to improve the quality of your product. And let's face it  the credit rating  agencies have contributed  putting the global economy on the brink  and yet they have to change the way they operate. The second point  would you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer  Obviously not  right  That would be irresponsible. But that's actually what's going on in the rating agency sector every single day. The customers of these rating agencies  like countries or companies  they are paying for their own ratings  and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest. The third point is  the rating agencies are not really telling us how they are coming up with their ratings  but in this day and age  you can't even sell a candy bar without listing everything that's inside. But for ratings  a crucial element of our economy  we really do not know what all the different ingredients are. We are allowing the rating agencies to be intransparent about their work  and we need to change this. I think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul  not just a trimming at the margins. I think it's time for a bold move. I think it's time to upgrade the system. And this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundation have invested a lot of time and effort thinking about an alternative for the sector. And we have developed the first model for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk  and we call it by its acronym  INCRA. INCRA would make a difference to the current system by adding another nonprofit player to the mix. It would be based on a nonprofit model that would be based on a sustainable endowment. The endowment would create income that would allow us to run the operation  to run the rating agency  and it would also allow us to make our ratings publicly available. But this is not enough to make a difference  right  INCRA would also be based on a very  very clear governance structure that would avoid any conflict of interest  and it would include many stakeholders from society. INCRA would not only be a European or an American rating agency  it would be a truly international one  in which  in particular  the emerging economies would have an equal interest   voice and representation. The second big difference that INCRA would make is that would it base its sovereign risk assessment on a broader set of indicators. Think about it that way. If we conduct a sovereign rating  we basically take a look at the economic soil of a country  its macroeconomic fundamentals. But we also have to ask the question  who is cultivating the economic soil of a country  right  Well  a country has many gardeners  and one of them is the government  so we have to ask the question  how is a country governed  How is it managed  And this is the reason why we have developed what we call forward looking indicators. These are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country. I hope you would agree it's important for you to know if your government is willing to invest  in renewable energy and education. It's important for you to know if the government of your country is able to manage a crisis  if the government is finally able to implement the reforms that it's promised. For example  if INCRA would rate South Africa right now  of course we would take a very  very close look at the youth unemployment of the country  the highest in the world. If over    percent of a country's population under the age of    is unemployed  of course this has a huge impact on the economy today and even more so in the future. Well  our friends at Moody's  Standard   Poor's  and Fitch will tell us we would take this into account as well. But guess what  We do not know exactly how they will take this into account. And this leads me to the third big difference that INCRA would make. INCRA would not only release its ratings but it would also release its indicators and methodology. So in contrast to the current system  INCRA would be fully transparent. So in a nutshell  INCRA would offer an alternative to the current system of the big three rating agencies by adding a new  nonprofit player to the mix that would increase the competition  it would increase the transparency of the sector  and it would also increase the quality. I can tell that sovereign ratings may still look to you like this very small piece of this very complex global financial world  but I tell you it's a very important one  and a very important one to fix  because sovereign ratings affect all of us  and they should be addressed and should be defined as public goods. And this is why we are testing our model right now  and why we are trying to find out if it can bring together a group of able and willing actors to bring INCRA to life. I truly believe building up INCRA is in everyone's interest  and that we have the unique opportunity right now to turn INCRA into a cornerstone of a new  more inclusive financial system. Because for way too long  we have left the big financial players on their own. It's time to give them some company. Thank you. I had brain surgery    years ago  and since that time  brain science has become a personal passion of mine. I'm actually an engineer. And first let me say  I recently joined Google's Moonshot group  where I had a division  the display division in Google X  and the brain science work I'm speaking about today is work I did before I joined Google and on the side outside of Google. So that said  there's a stigma when you have brain surgery. Are you still smart or not  And if not  can you make yourself smart again  After my neurosurgery  part of my brain was missing  and I had to deal with that. It wasn't the grey matter  but it  was the gooey part dead center that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters. Immediately after my surgery  I had to decide what amounts of each of over a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day  because if I just took nothing  I would die within hours. Every day now for    years    every single day    I've had to try to decide the combinations and mixtures of chemicals  and try to get them  to stay alive. There have been several close calls. But luckily  I'm an experimentalist at heart  so I decided I would experiment to try to find more optimal dosages because there really isn't a clear road map on this that's detailed. I began to try different mixtures  and I was blown away by how tiny changes in dosages dramatically changed my sense of self  my sense of who I was  my thinking  my behavior towards people. One particularly dramatic case  for a couple months I actually tried dosages and chemicals typical of a man in his early   s  and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed. I was angry all the time  I thought about sex constantly  and I thought I was the smartest person in the entire world  and   Laughter   of course over the years I'd met guys kind of like that  or maybe kind of toned down versions of that. I was kind of extreme. But to me  the surprise was  I wasn't trying to be arrogant. I was actually trying  with a little bit of insecurity  to actually fix a problem in front of me  and it just didn't come out that way. So I couldn't handle it. I changed my dosages. But that experience  I think  gave me a new appreciation for men and what they might walk through  and I've gotten along with men a lot better since then. What I was trying to do with tuning these hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth was to try to get my intelligence back after my illness and surgery  my creative thought  my idea flow. And I think mostly in images  and so for me that became a key metric    how to get these mental images that I use as a way of rapid prototyping  if you will  my ideas  trying on different new ideas for size  playing out scenarios. This kind of thinking isn't new. Philiosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes saw things similarly. They thought that mental images and ideas were actually the same thing. There are those today that dispute that  and lots of debates about how the mind works  but for me it's simple  Mental images  for most of us  are central in inventive and creative thinking. So after several years  I tuned myself up and I have lots of great  really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication and the analytical backbone behind them. And so now I'm working on  how can I get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen faster  Can you imagine  if you will  a movie director being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her  Or a musician to get the music out of his head  There are incredible possibilities with this as a way for creative people to share at light speed. And the truth is  the remaining bottleneck in being able to do this is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems. So let me show you why I think  we're pretty close to getting there by sharing with you two recent experiments from two top neuroscience groups. Both used fMRI technology    functional magnetic resonance imaging technology    to image the brain  and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis and his colleagues at Harvard. And the left hand column shows a brain scan of a person looking at an image. The middle column shows the brainscan of that same individual imagining  seeing that same image. And the right column was created by subtracting the middle  column from the left column  showing the difference to be nearly zero. This was repeated on lots of different individuals with lots of different images  always with a similar result. The difference between seeing an image and imagining seeing that same image is next to nothing. Next let me share with you one other experiment  this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley. They've been able to decode brainwaves into recognizable visual fields. So let me set this up for you. In this experiment  individuals were shown hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while scans were made of their brains to create a large library of their brain reacting to video sequences. Then a new movie was shown with new images  new people  new animals in it  and a new scan set was recorded. The computer  using brain scan data alone  decoded that new brain scan to show what it thought the  individual was actually seeing. On the right hand side  you see the computer's guess  and on the left hand side  the presented clip. This is the jaw dropper. We are so close to being able to do this. We just need to up the resolution. And now remember that when you see an image versus when you imagine that same image  it creates the same brain scan. So this was done with the highest resolution brain scan systems available today  and their resolution has increased really about a thousandfold in the last several years. Next we need to increase the resolution another thousandfold to get a deeper glimpse. How do we do that  There's a lot of techniques in this approach. One way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes. I'm not for that. There's a lot of new imaging techniques being proposed  some even by me  but given the recent success of MRI  first we need to ask the question  is it the end of the road with this technology  Conventional wisdom says the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets  but at this point bigger magnets only offer incremental resolution improvements  not the thousandfold we need. I'm putting forward an idea  instead of bigger magnets  let's make better magnets. There's some new technology breakthroughs in nanoscience when applied to magnetic structures that have created a whole new class of magnets  and with these magnets  we can lay down very fine detailed magnetic field patterns throughout the brain  and using those  we can actually create holographic like interference structures to get precision control over many patterns  as is shown here by shifting things. We can create much more complicated structures with slightly different arrangements  kind of like making Spirograph. So why does that matter  A lot of effort in MRI over the years has gone into making really big  really huge magnets  right  But yet most of the recent advances in resolution have actually come from ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers in the MRI systems. Let's also  instead of a uniform magnetic field  put down structured magnetic patterns in addition to the F.M. radio frequencies. So by combining the magnetics patterns with the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies processing which can massively increase the information that we can extract in a single scan. And on top of that  we can then layer our ever growing knowledge  of brain structure and memory to create a thousandfold increase that we need. And using fMRI  we should be able to measure not just oxygenated blood flow  but the hormones and neurotransmitters  I've talked about and maybe even the direct neural activity  which is the dream. We're going to be able to dump our ideas directly to digital media. Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language and communicate directly with human thought  What would we be capable of then  And how will we learn to deal with the truths of unfiltered human thought  You think the Internet was big. These are huge questions. It might be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills. And indeed  this very same tool may prove to lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar diseases. We have little option but to open this door. Regardless  pick a year    will it happen in five years or    years  It's hard to imagine it taking much longer. We need to learn how to take this step together. Thank you. I'm going to talk a little bit about strategy and its relationship with technology. We tend to think of business strategy as being a rather abstract body of essentially economic thought  perhaps rather timeless. I'm going to argue that  in fact  business strategy has always been premised on assumptions about technology  that those assumptions are changing  and  in fact  changing quite dramatically  and that therefore what that will drive us to is a different concept of what we mean by business strategy. Let me start  if I may  with a little bit of history. The idea of strategy in business owes its origins to two intellectual giants  Bruce Henderson  the founder of BCG  and Michael Porter  professor at the Harvard Business School. Henderson's central idea was what you might call the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness  of overwhelming the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that  in the business world  there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns    scale  experience. The more you do of something  disproportionately the better you get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order to achieve competitive advantage. And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. Porter agreed with that premise  but he qualified it. He pointed out  correctly  that that's all very well  but businesses actually have multiple steps to them. They have different components  and each of those components might be driven by a different kind of strategy. A company or a business might actually be advantaged in some activities but disadvantaged in others. He formed the concept of the value chain  essentially the sequence of steps with which a  shall we say  raw material  becomes a component  becomes assembled into a finished product  and then is distributed  for example  and he argued that advantage accrued to each of those components  and that the advantage of the whole was in some sense the sum or the average of that of its parts. And this idea of the value chain was predicated on the recognition that what holds a business together is transaction costs  that in essence you need to coordinate  organizations are more efficient at coordination than markets  very often  and therefore the nature and role and boundaries of the cooperation are defined by transaction costs. It was on those two ideas  Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience  and Porter's idea of the value chain  encompassing heterogenous elements  that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected. Now what I'm going to argue is that those premises are  in fact  being invalidated. First of all  let's think about transaction costs. There are really two components to transaction costs. One is about processing information  and the other is about communication. These are the economics of processing and communicating as they have evolved over a long period of time. As we all know from so many contexts  they have been radically transformed since the days when Porter and Henderson first formulated their theories. In particular  since the mid '  s  communications costs have actually been falling even faster than transaction costs  which is why communication  the Internet  has exploded in such a dramatic fashion. Now  those falling transaction costs have profound consequences  because if transaction costs are the glue that hold value chains together  and they are falling  there is less to economize on. There is less need for vertically integrated organization  and value chains at least can break up. They needn't necessarily  but they can. In particular  it then becomes possible for a competitor in one business to use their position in one step of the value chain in order to penetrate or attack or disintermediate the competitor in another. That is not just an abstract proposition. There are many very specific stories of how that actually happened. A poster child example was the encyclopedia business. The encyclopedia business in the days of leatherbound books was basically a distribution business. Most of the cost was the commission to the salesmen. The CD ROM and then the Internet came along  new technologies made the distribution of knowledge many orders of magnitude cheaper  and the encyclopedia industry collapsed. It's now  of course  a very familiar story. This  in fact  more generally was the story of the first generation of the Internet economy. It was about falling transaction costs breaking up value chains and therefore allowing disintermediation  or what we call deconstruction. One of the questions I was occasionally asked was  well  what's going to replace the encyclopedia when Britannica no longer has a business model  And it was a while before the answer became manifest. Now  of course  we know what it is  it's the Wikipedia. Now what's special about the Wikipedia is not its distribution. What's special about the Wikipedia is the way it's produced. The Wikipedia  of course  is an encyclopedia created by its users. And this  in fact  defines what you might call the second decade of the Internet economy  the decade in which the Internet as a noun became the Internet as a verb. It became a set of conversations  the era in which user generated content and social networks became the dominant phenomenon. Now what that really meant in terms of the Porter Henderson framework was the collapse of certain kinds of economies of scale. It turned out that tens of thousands of autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia could do just as good a job  and certainly a much cheaper job  than professionals in a hierarchical organization. So basically what was happening was that one layer of this value chain was becoming fragmented  as individuals could take over where organizations were no longer needed. But there's another question that obviously this graph poses  which is  okay  we've gone through two decades    does anything distinguish the third  And what I'm going to argue is that indeed something does distinguish the third  and it maps exactly on to the kind of Porter Henderson logic that we've been talking about. And that is  about data. If we go back to around       a lot of people were talking about the information revolution  and it was indeed true that the world's stock of data was growing  indeed growing quite fast. but it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog. We go forward to       not only had the world's stock of data exploded  but there'd been this massive substitution of digital for analog. And more important even than that  if you look more carefully at this graph  what you will observe is that about a half of that digital data is information that has an I.P. address. It's on a server or it's on a P.C. But having an I.P. address means that it can be connected to any other data that has an I.P. address. It means it becomes possible to put together half of the world's knowledge in order to see patterns  an entirely new thing. If we run the numbers forward to today  it probably looks something like this. We're not really sure. If we run the numbers forward to       we of course have an exact number  courtesy of IDC. It's curious that the future is so much more predictable than the present. And what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication in the stock of information that is connected via an I.P. address. Now  if the number of connections that we can make is proportional to the number of pairs of data points  a hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data is a ten thousandfold multiplication in the number of patterns that we can see in that data  this just in the last    or    years. This  I would submit  is a sea change  a profound change in the economics of the world that we live in. The first human genome  that of James Watson  was mapped as the culmination of the Human Genome Project in the year       and it took about     million dollars and about    years of work to map just one person's genomic makeup. Since then  the costs of mapping the genome have come down. In fact  they've come down in recent years very dramatically indeed  to the point where the cost  is now below       dollars  and it's confidently predicted that by the year      it will be below     dollars    a five or six order of magnitude drop in the cost of genomic mapping in just a    year period  an extraordinary phenomenon. Now  in the days when mapping a genome cost millions  or even tens of thousands  it was basically a research enterprise. Scientists would gather some representative people  and they would see patterns  and they would try and make generalizations about human nature and disease from the abstract patterns they find from these particular selected individuals. But when the genome can  be mapped for     bucks     dollars while you wait  then what happens is  it becomes retail. It becomes above all clinical. You go the doctor with a cold  and if he or she hasn't done it already  the first thing they do is map your genome  at which point what they're now doing is not starting from some abstract  knowledge of genomic medicine and trying to work out how it applies to you  but they're starting from your particular genome. Now think of the power of that. Think of where that takes us when we can combine genomic data with clinical data with data about drug interactions with the kind of ambient data that devices like our phone and medical sensors will increasingly be collecting. Think what happens when we collect all of that data and we can put it together in order to find patterns we wouldn't see before. This  I would suggest  perhaps it will take a while  but this will drive a revolution in medicine. Fabulous  lots of people talk about this. But there's one thing that doesn't get much attention. How is that model of colossal sharing across all of those kinds of databases compatible with the business models of institutions and organizations and corporations that are involved in this business today  If your business is based on proprietary data  if your competitive advantage is defined by your data  how on Earth is that company or is that society in fact going to achieve the value that's implicit in the technology  They can't. So essentially what's happening here  and genomics is merely one example of this  is that technology is driving the natural scaling of the activity beyond the institutional boundaries within which we have been used to thinking about it  and in particular beyond the institutional boundaries in terms of which business strategy as a discipline is formulated. The basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated  oligopolistic competition among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving  by one means or another  from a vertical structure to a horizontal one. Why is that happening  It's happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing. The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together  and allows them to separate. The polarization of scale economies towards the very small    small is beautiful    allows for scalable communities to substitute for conventional corporate production. The scaling in the opposite direction  towards things like big data  drive the structure of business towards the creation of new kinds of institutions that can achieve that scale. But either way  the typically vertical structure gets driven to becoming more horizontal. The logic isn't just about big data. If we were to look  for example  at the telecommunications industry  you can tell the same story about fiber optics. If we look at the pharmaceutical industry  or  for that matter  university research  you can say exactly the same story about so called  big science.  And in the opposite direction  if we look  say  at the energy sector  where all the talk is about how households will be efficient producers of green energy and efficient conservers of energy  that is  in fact  the reverse phenomenon. That is the fragmentation of scale because the very small can substitute for the traditional corporate scale. Either way  what we are driven to is this horizontalization of the structure of industries  and that implies fundamental changes in how we think about strategy. It means  for example  that we need to think about strategy as the curation of these kinds of horizontal structure  where things like business definition and even industry definition are actually the outcomes of strategy  not something that the strategy presupposes. It means  for example  we need to work out how to accommodate collaboration and competition simultaneously. Think about the genome. We need to accommodate the very large and the very small simultaneously. And we need industry structures that will accommodate very  very different motivations  from the amateur motivations of people in communities to maybe the social motivations of infrastructure built by governments  or  for that matter  cooperative institutions built by companies that are otherwise competing  because that is the only way that they can get to scale. These kinds of transformations render the traditional premises  of business strategy obsolete. They drive us into a completely new world. They require us  whether we are in the public sector or the private sector  to think very fundamentally differently about the structure of business  and  at last  it makes strategy interesting again. Thank you. The      Arab Spring captured the attention of the world. It also captured the attention of authoritarian governments in other countries  who were worried that revolution would spread. To respond  they ramped up surveillance of activists  journalists and dissidents who they feared would inspire revolution in their own countries. One prominent Bahraini activist  who was arrested and tortured by his government  has said that the interrogators showed him transcripts of his telephone calls and text messages. Of course  it's no secret that governments are able to intercept telephone calls and text messages. It's for that reason that many activists specifically avoid using the telephone. Instead  they use tools like Skype  which they think are immune to interception. They're wrong. There have now been over the last few years an industry of companies who provide surveillance technology to governments  specifically technology that allows those governments to hack into the computers of surveillance targets. Rather than intercepting the communications  as they go over the wire  instead they now hack into your computer  enable your webcam  enable your microphone  and steal documents from your computer. When the government of Egypt fell in       activists raided the office of the secret police  and among the many documents they found was this document by the Gamma Corporation  by Gamma International. Gamma is a German company that manufactures surveillance software and sells it only to governments. It's important to note that most governments don't really have the in house capabilities to develop this software. Smaller ones don't have the resources or the expertise  and so there's this market of Western companies who are happy to supply them with the tools and techniques for a price. Gamma is just one of these companies. I should note also that Gamma never actually sold their software to the Egyptian government. They'd sent them an invoice for a sale  but the Egyptians never bought it. Instead  apparently  the Egyptian government used a free demo version of Gamma's software. So this screenshot is from a sales video that Gamma produced. Really  they're just emphasizing in a relatively slick presentation the fact that the police can sort of sit in an air conditioned office and remotely monitor someone without them having any idea that it's going on. You know  your webcam light won't turn on. There's nothing to indicate that the microphone is enabled. This is the managing director of Gamma International. His name is Martin Muench. There are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist. This is perhaps my favorite. I'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam. You can see there's a little sticker that's placed over his camera. He knows what kind of surveillance is possible  and so clearly he doesn't want it to be used against him. Muench has said that he intends for his software to be used to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles. Of course  he's also acknowledged that once the software has been sold to governments  he has no way of knowing how it can be used. Gamma's software has been located on servers in countries around the world  many with really atrocious track records and human rights violations. They really are selling their software around the world. Gamma is not the only company in the business. As I said  it's a    billion industry. One of the other big guys in the industry is an Italian company called Hacking Team. Now  Hacking Team has what is probably the slickest presentation. The video they've produced is very sexy  and so I'm going to play you a clip just so you can get a feel both for the capabilities of the software but also how it's marketed to their government clients. You have to hack your target.   While your target is browsing the web  exchanging documents  receiving SMS  crossing the borders   You have to hit many different platforms.   Windows  OS X  iOS  Android  Blackberry  Symbian  Linux   You have to overcome encryption and capture relevant data.  Skype   encrypted calls  target location   messaging  relationships  web browsing  audio   video   Being stealth and untraceable.   Immune to any protection system Hidden collection infrastructure   Deployed all over your country.   Up to hundreds of thousands of targets Managed from a single spot   Exactly what we do. Christopher Soghoian  So  it would be funny if it wasn't true  but  in fact  Hacking Team's software is being sold to governments around the world. Last year we learned  for example  that it's been used to target Moroccan  journalists by the Moroccan government. Many  many countries it's been found in. So  Hacking Team has also been actively courting the U.S. law enforcement market. In the last year or so  the company has opened a sales office in Maryland. The company has also hired a spokesperson. They've been attending surveillance industry conferences where law enforcement officials show up. They've spoken at the conferences. What I thought was most fascinating was they've actually paid for the coffee break at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year. I can't tell you for sure that Hacking Team has sold their technology in the United States  but what I can tell you that if they haven't sold it  it isn't because they haven't been trying hard. So as I said before  governments that don't really have the resources to build their own tools will buy off the shelf surveillance software  and so for that reason  you see that the government of  say  Tunisia  might use the same software as the government of Germany. They're all buying off the shelf stuff. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States does have the budget to build their own surveillance technology  and so for several years  I've been trying to figure out if and how the FBI is hacking into the computers of surveillance targets. My friends at an organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation    they're a civil society group   obtained hundreds of documents from the FBI detailing their next generation of surveillance technologies. Most of these documents were heavily redacted  but what you can see from the slides  if I zoom in  is this term  Remote Operations Unit. Now  when I first looked into this  I'd never heard of this unit before. I've been studying surveillance for more than six years. I'd never heard of it. And so I went online and I did some research  and ultimately I hit the mother lode when I went to LinkedIn  the social networking site for job seekers. There were lots of former U.S. government contractors who had at one point worked for the Remote Operating Unit  and were describing in surprising detail on their CVs what they had done in their former job. So I took this information and I gave it to a journalist that I know and trust at the Wall Street Journal  and she was able to contact several other former law enforcement officials who spoke on background and confirmed that yes  in fact  the FBI has a dedicated team that does nothing but hack into the computers of surveillance targets. Like Gamma and Hacking Team  the FBI also has the capability to remotely activate webcams  microphones  steal documents  get web browsing information  the works. There's sort of a big problem with governments going into hacking  and that's that terrorists  pedophiles  drug dealers  journalists and human rights activists all use the same kinds of computers. There's no drug dealer phone and there's no journalist laptop. We all use the same technology  and what that means then is that for governments to have the capability to hack into the computers of the real bad guys  they also have to have the capability to hack into our devices too. So governments around the world have been embracing this technology. They've been embracing hacking as a law enforcement technique  but without any real debate. In the United States  where I live  there have been no congressional hearings. There's no law that's been passed specifically authorizing this technique  and because of its power and potential for abuse  it's vital that we have an informed public debate. Thank you very much. This is a vending machine in Los Angeles. It's in a shopping mall  and it sells fish eggs. It's a caviar vending machine. This is the Art o mat  an art vending machine that sells small artistic creations by different artists  usually on small wood blocks or matchboxes  in limited edition. This is Oliver Medvedik. He's not a vending machine  but he is one of the founders of Genspace  a community biolab in Brooklyn  New York  where anybody can go and take classes and learn how to do things like grow E. coli that glows in the dark or learn how to take strawberry DNA. In fact  I saw Oliver do one of these strawberry DNA extractions about a year ago  and this is what led me onto this bizarre path that I'm going to talk to you right now. Because strawberry DNA is really  fascinating  because it's so beautiful. I'd never thought about DNA being a beautiful thing before  before I saw it in this form. And a lot of people  especially in the art community  don't necessarily engage in science in this way. I instantly joined Genspace after this  and I asked Oliver   Well  if we can do this strawberries  can we do this with people as well   And about    minutes later  we were both spinning it in vials together and coming up with a protocol for human DNA extraction. And I started doing this on my own  and this is what my DNA actually looks like. And I was at a dinner party with some friends  some artist friends  and I was telling them about this project  and they couldn't believe that you could actually see DNA. So I said  all right  let's get out some supplies right now. And I started having these bizarre dinner  parties at my house on Friday nights where people would come over and we would do DNA extractions  and I would actually capture them on video  because it created this kind of funny portrait as well. These are people who don't necessarily regularly engage with science whatsoever. You can kind of tell from their reactions. But they became fascinated by it  and it was really exciting for me to see them get excited about science. And so I started doing this regularly. It's kind of an odd thing to do with your Friday nights  but this is what I started doing  and I started collecting a whole group of my friends' DNA in small vials and categorizing them. This is what that looked like. And it started to make me think about a couple of things. First of all  this looked a lot like my Facebook wall. So in a way  I've created sort of a genetic network  a genetic social network  really. And the second thing was  one time a friend came over and looked at this on my table and was like   Oh. Why are they numbered  Is this person more rare than the other one   And I hadn't even thought about that. They were just numbered because that was the order that I extracted the DNA in. But that made me think about collecting toys  and this thing that's going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys  and being able to collect these rare toys. You buy these boxes. You're not sure what's going to be inside of them. But then  when you open them up  you have different rarities of the toys. And so I thought that was interesting. I started thinking about this and the caviar vending machine and the Art o mat all together  and some reason  I was one night drawing a vending machine  thinking about doing paintings of a vending machine  and the little vial of my DNA was sitting there  and I saw this kind of beautiful collaboration between the strands of DNA and the coils of a vending machine. And so  of course  I decided to create an art installation called the DNA Vending Machine. Here it is.   DNA Vending Machine is an art installation about our increasing access to biotechnology.     For a reasonable cost  you can purchase a sample of human DNA from a traditional vending machine.     Each sample comes packaged with a collectible limited edition portrait of the human specimen.     DNA Vending Machine treats DNA as a collectible material and brings to light legal issues over the ownership of DNA.   Gabriel Garcia Colombo  So the DNA Vending Machine is currently in a couple galleries in New York  and it's selling out pretty well  actually. We're in the first edition of     pieces  hoping to do another edition pretty soon. I'd actually like to get it into more of a metro hub  like Grand Central or Penn Station  right next to some of the other  actual  vending machines in that location. But really with this project and a lot of my art projects I want to ask the audience a question  and that is  when biotechnology and DNA sequencing becomes as cheap as  say  laser cutting or  D printing or buying caviar from a vending machine  will you still submit your sample of DNA to be part of the vending machine  And how much will these samples be worth  And will you buy someone else's sample  And what will you be able to do with that sample  Thank you. The year is     . A curious little invention is being talked about. It's called a microscope. What it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye. Soon comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms are actually causes of terrible human diseases. Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup  not very far from here. This is from London. Fast forward     years. We still have this monster soup around  and it's taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt. Just for malaria itself  there are a million deaths a year  and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections. Now it's actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters. You take a stain  like acridine orange or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa  and a microscope  and you look at them. They all have faces. Why is that so  that Alex in Kenya  Fatima in Bangladesh  Navjoot in Mumbai  and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick  And that's primarily because scalability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach. And remember that number  one billion. The problem lies with the microscope itself. Even though the pinnacle of modern science  research microscopes are not designed for field testing. Neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all. They are heavy  bulky  really hard to maintain  and cost a lot of money. This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the '  s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing T.B. in his ashram in Sevagram in India. Two of my students  Jim and James  traveled around India and Thailand  starting to think about this problem a lot. We saw all kinds of donated equipment. We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses. And we saw people who had a functional microscope but just didn't know how to even turn it on. What grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes. So what is a Foldscope  A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope  a platform for fluorescence  bright field  polarization  projection  all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper. So  now you think  how is that possible  I'm going to show you some examples here  and we will run through some of them. It starts with a single sheet of paper. What you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright field and fluorescence microscope. So  there are three stages  There is the optical stage  the illumination stage and the mask holding stage. And there are micro optics at the bottom that's actually embedded in the paper itself. What you do is  you take it on  and just like you are playing like a toy  which it is  I tab it off  and I break it off. This paper has no instructions and no languages. There is a code  a color code embedded  that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope. When it's done  it looks something like this  has all the functionalities of a standard microscope  just like an XY stage  a place where a sample slide could go  for example right here. We didn't want to change this  because this is the standard that's been optimized for over the years  and many health workers are actually used to this. So this is what changes  but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases. You pop this in. There is an XY stage  and then there is a focusing stage  which is a flexure mechanism that's built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps. So what's really interesting about this object  and my students hate when I do this  but I'm going to do this anyway  is these are rugged devices. I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stomp on it. And they last  even though they're designed from a very flexible material  like paper. Another fun fact is  this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool  but here in this envelope I have    different foldscopes of different configurations all in a single folder. And I'm going to pick one randomly. This one  it turns out  is actually designed specifically for malaria  because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria. So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this. So up till now  you didn't actually see what I would see from one of these setups. So what I would like to do is  if we could dim the lights  please  it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes. I have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn    go to the back of the wall    and just project  and this way you will see exactly what I would see. What you're looking at    This is a cross section of a compound eye  and when I'm going to zoom in closer  right there  I am going through the z axis. You actually see how the lenses are cut together in the cross section pattern. Another example  one of my favorite insects  I love to hate this one  is a mosquito  and you're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens. Right there. All from the simple setup that I actually described. So my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever I forget them in the dryer. So it turns out they're waterproof  and    right here is just fluorescent water  and I don't know if you can actually see this. This also shows you how  the projection scope works. You get to see the beam the  way it's projected and bent. Can we get the lights back on again  So I'm quickly going to show you  since I'm running out of time  in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture  the biggest idea was roll to roll manufacturing  so we built this out of    cents of parts and costs. And what this allows us to do is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy  which we call use and throw microscopy. I'm going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in. Here is a sheet of paper. This is when we were thinking about the idea. This is an A  sheet of paper. These are the three stages that you actually see. And the optical components  if you look at the inset up on the right  we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs  so it uses a process of self assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself. So that's where the lenses go. There are some light sources. And essentially  in the end  all the parts line up because of origami  because of the fact that origami allows us micron scale precision of optical alignment. So even though this looks like a simple toy  the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated. So here is another obvious thing that we would do  typically  if I was going to show that these microscopes are robust  is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself. There it is  and it survives. So for us  the next step actually is really finishing our field trials. We are starting at the end of the summer. We are at a stage where we'll be  making thousands of microscopes. That would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place. We've started collecting data for malaria  Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves. And I want to leave you with this picture. I had not anticipated this before  but a really interesting link between hands on science education and global health. What are the tools that we're actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow  I would love for them to be able to just print out a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets. Thank you. I work with children with autism. Specifically  I make technologies to help them communicate. Now  many of the problems that children with autism face  they have a common source  and that source is that they find it difficult to understand abstraction  symbolism. And because of this  they have  a lot of difficulty with language. Let me tell you a little bit about why this is. You see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup. All of us can see it. All of us understand this. These are two other pictures of soup  but you can see that these are more abstract These are not quite as concrete. And when you get to language  you see that it becomes a word whose look  the way it looks and the way it sounds  has absolutely nothing to do  with what it started with  or what it represents  which is the bowl of soup. So it's essentially a completely abstract  a completely arbitrary representation of something which is in the real world  and this is something that children with autism have an incredible amount of difficulty with. Now that's why most of the people  that work with children with autism    speech therapists  educators    what they do is  they try to help children with autism communicate not with words  but with pictures. So if a child with autism wanted to say   I want soup   that child would pick three different pictures   I    want   and  soup   and they would put these together  and then the therapist or the parent would understand that this is what the kid wants to say. And this has been incredibly effective  for the last        years people have been doing this. In fact  a few years back  I developed an app for the iPad which does exactly this. It's called Avaz  and the way it works is that kids select different pictures. These pictures are sequenced together to form sentences  and these sentences are spoken out. So Avaz is essentially converting pictures  it's a translator  it converts pictures into speech. Now  this was very effective. There are thousands of children using this  you know  all over the world  and I started thinking about what it does and what it doesn't do. And I realized something interesting  Avaz helps children with autism learn words. What it doesn't help them do is to learn word patterns. Let me explain this in a little more detail. Take this sentence   I want soup tonight.  Now it's not just the words here that convey the meaning. It's also the way in which these words are arranged  the way these words are modified and arranged. And that's why a sentence like  I want soup tonight  is different from a sentence like  Soup want I tonight   which  is completely meaningless. So there is another hidden abstraction here which children with autism find a lot of difficulty coping with  and that's the fact that you can modify words and you can arrange them to have different meanings  to convey different ideas. Now  this is what we call grammar. And grammar is incredibly powerful  because grammar is this one component of language which takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have and allows us to convey an infinite amount of information  an infinite amount of ideas. It's the way in which you can put things together in order to convey anything you want to. And so after I developed Avaz  I worried for a very long time about how I could give grammar  to children with autism. The solution came to me from a very interesting perspective. I happened to chance upon a child with autism conversing with her mom  and this is what happened. Completely out of the blue  very spontaneously  the child got up and said   Eat.  Now what was interesting was the way in which the mom was trying to tease out the meaning of what the child wanted to say by talking to her in questions. So she asked   Eat what  Do  you want to eat ice cream  You want to eat  Somebody else wants to eat  You want to eat cream now  You want to eat ice cream in the evening   And then it struck me that what the mother had done was something incredible. She had been able to get that child to communicate an idea to her without grammar. And it struck me that maybe this is what I was looking for. Instead of arranging words in an order  in sequence  as a sentence  you arrange them in this map  where they're all linked together not by placing them one after the other but in questions  in question answer pairs. And so if you do this  then what you're conveying is not a sentence in English  but what you're conveying is really a meaning  the meaning of a sentence in English. Now  meaning is really the underbelly  in some sense  of language. It's what comes after thought but before language. And the idea was that this particular representation might convey meaning in its raw form. So I was very excited by this  you know  hopping around all over the place  trying to figure out if I can convert all possible sentences that I hear into this. And I found that this is not enough. Why is this not enough  This is not enough because if you wanted to convey something like negation  you want to say   I don't want soup   then you can't do that by asking a question. You do that by changing the word  want.  Again  if you wanted to say   I wanted soup yesterday   you do that by converting the word  want  into  wanted.  It's a past tense. So this is a flourish which I added to make the system complete. This is a map of words joined together as questions and answers  and with these filters applied on top of them in order to modify them to represent certain nuances. Let me show you this with a different example. Let's take this sentence   I told the carpenter I could not pay him.  It's a fairly complicated sentence. The way that this particular system works  you can start with any part of this sentence. I'm going to start with the word  tell.  So this is the word  tell.  Now this happened in the past  so I'm going to make that  told.  Now  what I'm going to do is  I'm going to ask questions. So  who told  I told. I told whom  I told the carpenter. Now we start with a different part of the sentence. We start with the word  pay   and we add the ability filter to it to make it  can pay.  Then we make it  can't pay   and we can make it  couldn't pay  by making it the past tense. So who couldn't pay  I couldn't pay. Couldn't pay whom  I couldn't pay the carpenter. And then you join these two together by asking this question  What did I tell the carpenter  I told the carpenter I could not pay him. Now think about this. This is   Applause   this is a representation of this sentence without language. And there are two or three interesting things about this. First of all  I could have started anywhere. I didn't have to start with the word  tell.  I could have started anywhere in the sentence  and I could have made this entire thing. The second thing is  if I wasn't an English speaker  if I was speaking in some other language  this map would actually hold true in any language. So long as the questions are standardized  the map is actually independent of language. So I call this FreeSpeech  and I was playing with this for many  many months. I was trying out so many different combinations of this. And then I noticed something very interesting about FreeSpeech. I was trying to convert language  convert sentences in English into sentences in FreeSpeech  and vice versa  and back and forth. And I realized that this particular configuration  this particular way of representing language  it allowed me to actually create very concise rules that go between FreeSpeech on one side and English on the other. So I could actually write this set of rules that translates from this particular representation into English. And so I developed this thing. I developed this thing called  the FreeSpeech Engine which takes any FreeSpeech sentence as the input and gives out perfectly grammatical English text. And by putting these two pieces together  the representation and the engine  I was able to create an app  a technology for children with autism  that not only gives them words but also gives them grammar. So I tried this out with kids with autism  and I found that there was an  incredible amount of identification. They were able to create sentences in FreeSpeech which were much more complicated but much more effective than equivalent sentences in English  and I started thinking about why that might be the case. And I had an idea  and I want to  talk to you about this idea next. In about       about    years back  there were a group of scientists that were trying to understand how the brain processes language  and they found something very interesting. They found that when you learn a language as a child  as a two year old  you learn it with a certain part of your brain  and when you learn a language as an adult    for example  if I wanted to learn Japanese right now   a completely different part of my brain is used. Now I don't know why that's the case  but my guess is that that's because when you learn a language as an adult  you almost invariably learn it through your native language  or through your first language. So what's interesting about FreeSpeech is that when you create a sentence or when you create language  a child with autism creates language with FreeSpeech  they're not using this support language  they're not using this bridge language. They're directly constructing the sentence. And so this gave me this idea. Is it possible to use FreeSpeech not for children with autism but to teach language to people without disabilities  And so I tried a number of experiments. The first thing I did was I built a jigsaw puzzle in which these questions and answers are coded in the form of shapes  in the form of colors  and you have people putting these together and trying to understand how this works. And I built an app out of it  a game out of it  in which children can play with words and with a reinforcement  a sound reinforcement of visual structures  they're able to learn language. And this  this has a lot of potential  a lot of promise  and the government of India recently licensed this technology from us  and they're going to try it out with millions of different children trying to teach them English. And the dream  the hope  the vision  really  is that when they learn English this way  they learn it with the same proficiency as their mother tongue. All right  let's talk about something else. Let's talk about speech. This is speech. So speech is the primary mode of communication delivered between all of us. Now what's interesting about speech is that speech is one dimensional. Why is it one dimensional  It's one dimensional because it's sound. It's also one dimensional because our mouths are built that way. Our mouths are built to create one dimensional sound. But if you think about the brain  the thoughts that we have in our heads are not one dimensional. I mean  we have these rich  complicated  multi dimensional ideas. Now  it seems to me that language is really the brain's invention to convert this rich  multi dimensional thought on one hand into speech on the other hand. Now what's interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays  and almost all of that is done in the language domain. Take Google  for example. Google trawls all these countless billions of websites  all of which are in English  and when you want to use Google  you go into Google search  and you type in English  and it matches the English with the English. What if we could do this in FreeSpeech instead  I have a suspicion that if we did this  we'd find that algorithms like searching  like retrieval  all of these things  are much simpler and also more effective  because they don't process the data structure of speech. Instead they're processing the data structure of thought. The data structure of thought. That's a provocative idea. But let's look at this in a little more detail. So this is the FreeSpeech ecosystem. We have the Free Speech representation on one side  and we have the FreeSpeech  Engine  which generates English. Now if you think about it  FreeSpeech  I told you  is completely  language independent. It doesn't have any specific information in it which is about English. So everything that this system knows about English is actually encoded into the engine. That's a pretty interesting concept in itself. You've encoded an entire human language into a software program. But if you look at what's inside the engine  it's actually not very complicated. It's not very complicated code. And what's more interesting is the fact that the vast majority of the code in that engine is not really English specific. And that gives this interesting idea. It might be very easy for us to actually create these engines in many  many different languages  in Hindi  in French  in German  in Swahili. And that gives another interesting idea. For example  supposing I was a writer  say  for a newspaper or for a magazine. I could create content in one language  FreeSpeech  and the person who's consuming that content  the person who's reading that particular information could choose any engine  and they could read it in their own mother tongue  in their native language. I mean  this is an incredibly attractive idea  especially for India. We have so many different languages. There's a song about India  and there's a description of the country as  it says  That means  ever smiling speaker of beautiful languages.  Language is beautiful. I think it's the most beautiful of human creations. I think it's the loveliest thing that our brains have invented. It entertains  it educates  it enlightens  but what I like the most about language is that it empowers. I want to leave you with this. This is a photograph of my collaborators  my earliest collaborators when I started working on language and autism and various other things. The girl's name is Pavna  and that's her mother  Kalpana. And Pavna's an entrepreneur  but her story is much more remarkable than mine  because Pavna is about   . She has quadriplegic cerebral palsy  so ever since she was born  she could neither move nor talk. And everything that she's accomplished so far  finishing school  going to college  starting a company  collaborating with me to develop Avaz  all of these things she's done with nothing more than moving her eyes. Daniel Webster said this  He said   If all of my possessions were taken from me with one exception  I would choose to keep the power of communication  for with it  I would regain all the rest.  And that's why  of all of these incredible  applications of FreeSpeech  the one that's closest to my heart still remains the ability for this to empower children with disabilities to be able to communicate  the power of communication  to get back all the rest. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  So my moment of truth did not come all at once. In       I had the chance to be considered for promotion from my job as director of policy planning at the U.S. State Department. This was my moment to lean in  to push myself forward for what are really only a handful of the very top foreign policy jobs  and I had just finished a big     month project for Secretary Clinton  successfully  and I knew I could handle a bigger job. The woman I thought I was would have said yes. But I had been commuting for two years between Washington and Princeton  New Jersey  where my husband and my two teenage sons lived  and it was not going well. I tried on the idea of eking out another two years in Washington  or maybe uprooting my sons from their school and my husband from his work and asking them to join me. But deep down  I knew that the right decision was to go home  even if I didn't fully recognize the woman who was making that choice. That was a decision based on love and responsibility. I couldn't keep watching my oldest son make bad choices without being able to be there for him when and if he needed me. But the real change came more gradually. Over the next year  while my family was righting itself  I started to realize that even if I could go back into government  I didn't want to. I didn't want to miss the last five years that my sons were at home. I finally allowed myself to accept what was really most important to me  not what I was conditioned to want or maybe what I conditioned myself to want  and that decision led to a reassessment of the feminist narrative that I grew up with and have always championed. I am still completely committed to the cause of male female equality  but let's think about what that equality really means  and how best to achieve it. I always accepted the idea that the most respected and powerful people in our society are men at the top of their careers  so that the measure of male female equality ought to be how many women are in those positions  prime ministers  presidents  CEOs  directors  managers  Nobel laureates  leaders. I still think we should do everything we possibly can to achieve that goal. But that's only half of real equality  and I now think we're never going to get there unless we recognize the other half. I suggest that real equality  full equality  does not just mean valuing women on male terms. It means creating a much wider range of equally respected choices for women and for men. And to get there  we have to change our workplaces  our policies and our culture. In the workplace  real equality means valuing family just as much as work  and understanding that the two reinforce each other. As a leader and as a manager  I have always acted on the mantra  if family comes first  work does not come second    life comes together. If you work for me  and you have a family issue  I expect you to attend to it  and I am confident  and my confidence has always been borne out  that the work will get done  and done better. Workers who have a reason to get home to care for their children or their family members are more focused  more efficient  more results focused. And breadwinners who are also caregivers have a much wider range of experiences and contacts. Think about a lawyer who spends part of his time at school events for his kids talking to other parents. He's much more likely to bring in new clients for his firm than a lawyer who never leaves his office. And caregiving itself develops patience    a lot of patience    and empathy  creativity  resilience  adaptability. Those are all attributes that are ever more important in a high speed  horizontal  networked global economy. The best companies actually know this. The companies that win awards for workplace flexibility in the United States include some of our most successful corporations  and a      national study on the changing workforce showed that employees in flexible and effective workplaces are more engaged with their work  they're more satisfied and more loyal  they have lower levels of stress and higher levels of mental health. And a      study of employers showed that deep  flexible practices actually lowered operating costs and increased adaptability in a global service economy. So you may think that the privileging of work over family is only an American problem. Sadly  though  the obsession with work is no longer a uniquely American disease. Twenty years ago  when my family first started going to Italy  we used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta. Siesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day. It's actually just as much about embracing the warmth of a family lunch. Now  when we go  fewer and fewer businesses close for siesta  reflecting the advance of global corporations and    hour competition. So making a place for those we love is actually a global imperative. In policy terms  real equality means recognizing that the work that women have traditionally done is just as important as the work that men have traditionally done  no matter who does it. Think about it  Breadwinning and caregiving are equally necessary for human survival. At least if we get beyond a barter economy  somebody has to earn an income and someone else has to convert that income to care and sustenance for loved ones. Now most of you  when you hear me talk about breadwinning and caregiving  instinctively translate those categories into men's work and women's work. And we don't typically challenge why men's work is advantaged. But consider a same sex couple like my friends Sarah and Emily. They're psychiatrists. They got married five years ago  and now they have two year old twins. They love being mothers  but they also love their work  and they're really good at what they do. So how are they going to divide up breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities  Should one of them stop working or reduce hours to be home  Or should they both change their practices so they can have much more flexible schedules  And what criteria should they use to make that decision  Is it who makes the most money or who is most committed to her career  Or who has the most flexible boss  The same sex perspective helps us see that juggling work and family are not women's problems  they're family problems. And Sarah and Emily are the lucky ones  because they have a choice about how much they want to work. Millions of men and women have to be both breadwinners and caregivers just to earn the income they need  and many of those workers are scrambling. They're patching together care arrangements that are inadequate and often actually unsafe. If breadwinning and caregiving are really equal  then why shouldn't a government invest as much in an infrastructure of care as the foundation of a healthy society as it invests in physical infrastructure as the backbone of a successful economy  The governments that get it    no surprises here    the governments that get it  Norway  Sweden  Denmark  the Netherlands  provide universal child care  support for caregivers at home  school and early childhood education  protections for pregnant women  and care for the elderly and the disabled. Those governments invest in that infrastructure the same way they invest in roads and bridges and tunnels and trains. Those societies also show you that breadwinning and caregiving reinforce each other. They routinely rank among the top    countries of the most globally competitive economies  but at the same time  they rank very high on the OECD Better Life Index. In fact  they rank higher than other governments  like my own  the U.S.  or Switzerland  that have higher average levels of income but lower rankings on work life balance. So changing our workplaces and building infrastructures of care would make a big difference  but we're not going to get equally valued choices unless we change our culture  and the kind of cultural change required means re socializing men. Increasingly in developed countries  women are socialized to believe that our place is no longer only in the home  but men are actually still where they always were. Men are still socialized to believe that they have to be breadwinners  that to derive their self worth from how high they can climb over other men on a career ladder. The feminist revolution still has a long way to go. It's certainly not complete. But    years after  The Feminine Mystique  was published  many women actually have more choices than men do. We can decide to be a breadwinner  a caregiver  or any combination of the two. When a man  on the other hand  decides to be a caregiver  he puts his manhood on the line. His friends may praise his decision  but underneath  they're scratching their heads. Isn't the measure of a man his willingness to compete with other men for power and prestige  And as many women hold that view as men do. We know that lots of women still judge the attractiveness of a man based in large part on how successful he is in his career. A woman can drop out of the work force and still be an attractive partner. For a man  that's a risky proposition. So as parents and partners  we should be socializing our sons and our husbands to be whatever they want to be  either caregivers or breadwinners. We should be socializing them to make caregiving cool for guys. I can almost hear lots of you thinking   No way.  But in fact  the change is  actually already happening. At least in the United States  lots of men take pride in cooking  and frankly obsess over stoves. They are in the birthing rooms. They take paternity leave when they can. They can walk a baby or soothe a toddler just as well as their wives can  and they are increasingly doing much more of the housework. Indeed  there are male college students now who are starting to say   I want to be a stay at home dad.  That was completely unthinkable    or even    years ago. And in Norway  where men have an automatic three month's paternity leave  but they lose it if they decide not to take it  a high government official told me that companies are starting to look at prospective male employees and raise an eyebrow if they didn't in fact take their leave when they had kids. That means that it's starting to seem like a character defect not to want to be a fully engaged father. So I was raised to believe that championing women's rights meant doing everything we could to get women to the top. And I still hope that I live long enough to see men and women equally represented at all levels of the work force. But I've come to believe that we have to value family every bit as much as we value work  and that we should entertain the idea that doing right by those we love will make all of us better at everything we do. Thirty years ago  Carol Gilligan  a wonderful psychologist  studied adolescent girls and identified an ethic of care  an element of human nature every bit as important as the ethic of justice. It turns out that  you don't care  is just as much a part of who we are as  that's not fair.  Bill Gates agrees. He argues that the two great forces of human nature are self interest and caring for others. Let's bring them both together. Let's make the feminist revolution a humanist revolution. As whole human beings  we will be better caregivers and breadwinners. You may think that can't happen  but I grew up in a society where my mother put out small vases of cigarettes for dinner parties  where blacks and whites used separate bathrooms  and where everybody claimed to be heterosexual. Today  not so much. The revolution for human equality can happen. It is happening. It will happen. How far and how fast is up to us. Thank you. Let me start by asking you a question  just with a show of hands  Who has an iPhone  Who has an Android phone  Who has a Blackberry  Who will admit in public to having a Blackberry  And let me guess  how many of you  when you arrived here  like me  went and bought a pay as you go SIM card  Yeah  I'll bet you didn't even know you're using African technology. Pay as you go was a technology  or an idea  pioneered in Africa by a company called Vodacom a good    years ago  and now  like franchising  pay as you go is one of the most dominant forces of economic activity in the world. So I'm going to talk about innovation in Africa  which I think is the purest form  innovation out of necessity. But first  I'm going to ask you some other questions. You don't have to put your hands up. These are rhetorical. Why did Nikola Tesla have to invent the alternating current that powers the lights in this building or the city that we're in  Why did Henry Ford have to invent the production line to produce these Fords that came in anything as long as they were black  And why did Eric Merrifield have to invent the dolos  Blank stares. That is what a dolos looks like  and in the background  you can see Robben Island. This is a small dolos  and Eric Merrifield is the most famous inventor you've never heard of. In       a storm ripped up the harbor in a small South African town called East London  and while he was watching his kids playing with toys made from oxen bones called dolosse  he had the idea for this. It's a bit like a huge jumping jack  and they have used this in every harbor in the world as a breakwater. The global shipping economy would not be possible without African technology like this. So whenever you talk about Africa  you have to put up this picture of the world from space  and people go   Look  it's the Dark Continent.  Actually  it isn't. What it is is a map of innovation. And it's really easy to see where innovation's going on. All the places with lots of electricity  it isn't. And the reason it isn't is because everybody's watching television or playing Angry Birds. So where it's happening is in Africa. Now  this is real innovation  not the way people have expropriated the word to talk about launching new products. This is real innovation  and I define it as problem solving. People are solving real problems in Africa. Why  Because we have to. Because we have real problems. And when we solve real problems for people  we solve them for the rest of the world at the same time. So in California  everybody's really excited about a little square of plastic that you plug into a phone and you can swipe your credit card  and people say   We've liberated the credit card from the point of sale terminal.  Fantastic. Why do you even need a credit card  In Africa  we've been doing that for years  and we've been doing it on phones like this. This is a picture I took at a place called Kitengela  about an hour south of Nairobi  and the thing that's so remarkable about the payment system that's been pioneered in Africa called M Pesa is that it works on phones like this. It works on every single phone possible  because it uses SMS. You can pay bills with it   you can buy your groceries  you can pay your kids' school fees  and I'm told you can even bribe customs officials. Something like    million dollars a day is transacted through M Pesa. Forty percent of Kenya's GDP moves through M Pesa using phones like this. And you think this is just a feature phone. Actually it's the smartphone of Africa. It's also a radio  and it's also a torch  and more than anything else  it has really superb battery life. Why  Because that's what we need. We have really severe energy problems in Africa. By the way  you can update Facebook and send Gmail from a phone like this. So we have found a way to use the available technology to send money via M Pesa  which is a bit like a check system for the mobile age. I come from Johannesburg  which is a mining town. It's built on gold. This is a picture I Instagrammed earlier. And the difference today is that  the gold of today is mobile. If you think about the railroad system in North America and how that worked  first came the infrastructure  then came the industry around it  the brothels    it's a bit like the Internet today  right    and everything else that worked with it  bars  saloons  etc. The gold of today is mobile  and mobile is the enabler that makes all of this possible. So what are some of the things that you can do with it  Well  this is by a guy called Bright Simons from Ghana  and what you do is you take medication  something that some people might spend their entire month's salary on  and you scratch off the code  and you send that to an SMS number  and it tells you if that is legitimate or if it's expired. Really simple  really effective  really life saving. In Kenya  there's a service called iCow  which just sends you really important information about how to look after your dairy. The dairy business in Kenya is a      million business  and the difference between a subsistence farmer and an abundance farmer is only a couple of liters of milk a day. And if you can do that  you can rise out of poverty. Really simple  using a basic phone. If you don't have electricity  no problem  We'll just make it out of old bicycle parts using a windmill  as William Kamkwamba did. There's another great African that you've heard that's busy disrupting the automobile industry in the world. He's also finding a way to reinvent solar power and the electricity industry in North America  and if he's lucky  he'll get us to Mars  hopefully in my lifetime. He comes from Pretoria  the capital of  South Africa   about    kilometers from where I live. So back to Joburg  which is sometimes called Egoli  which means City of Gold. And not only is mobile the gold of today  I don't believe that the gold is under the ground. I believe we are the gold. Like you've heard the other economists say  we are at the point where China was when its boom years began  and that's where we're going. So  you hear the West talk about innovation at the edge. Well  of course it's happening at the edge  because in the middle  everybody's updating Facebook  or worse still  they're trying to understand Facebook's privacy settings. This is not that catchy catchphrase. This is innovation over the edge. So  people like to call Africa a mobile first continent  but actually it's mobile only  so while everybody else is doing all of those things  we're solving the world's problems. So there's only one thing left to say.   You're welcome    Laughter  Anyone in the room thought about sex today  Yeah  you did. Thank you for putting your hand up over there. Well  I'm here to provide you with some biological validation for your sordid daydreams. I'm here to tell you a few things that you might not have known about wild sex. Now  when humans think about sex  male and female forms are generally what come to mind  but for many millions of years  such specific categories didn't even exist. Sex was a mere fusion of bodies or a trickle of DNA shared between two or more beings. It wasn't until about     million years ago that we start to see structures akin to a penis or a thing that gives DNA out  and a vagina  something that receives it. Now invariably  you're probably thinking about what belongs to our own species  these very familiar structures  but the diversity that we see in sexual structures in the animal kingdom that has evolved in response to the multitude of factors surrounding reproduction is pretty mind blowing. Penile diversity is especially profuse. So this is a paper nautilus. It's a close relative of squid and octopus  and males have a hectocotylus. Just what is a hectocotylus  A detachable  swimming penis. It leaves the  body of the male   finds the female through pheromonal cues in the water  attaches itself to her body and deposits the sperm. For many decades  biologists actually felt that the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether. Now  the tapir is a mammal from South America. And the tapir has a prehensile penis. It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands. And it uses this dexterity to bypass the vagina altogether and deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus  not to mention it's a pretty good size. The biggest penis in the animal kingdom  however  is not that of the tapir. The biggest penis to body size ratio in the animal kingdom actually belongs to the meager beach barnacle  and this video is actually showing you what the human penis would look like if it were the same size as that of a barnacle. Mm hm.  Laughter  So with all of this diversity in structure  one might think  then  that penises are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place for the purposes of successful reproduction. Simply insert part A into slot B  and we should all be good to go. But of course  that doesn't exactly happen  and that's because we can't just take form into account. We have to think about function as well  and when it comes to sex  function relates to the contributions made by the gametes  or the sperm and the eggs. And these contributions are far from equal. Eggs are very expensive to make  so it makes sense for females to be very choosy about who she shares them with. Sperm  on the other hand  is abundant and cheap  so it makes more sense for males to have a more sex is better strategy when it comes to siring members of future generations. So how do animals cope with these very incongruent needs between the sexes  I mean  if a female doesn't choose a particular male  or if she has the ability to store sperm and she simply has enough  then it makes more sense for her to spend her time doing other biologically relevant things  avoiding predators  taking care of offspring  gathering and ingesting food. This is  of course  bad news for any male who has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank  and this sets the scene for some pretty drastic strategies for successful fertilization. This is bedbug sex  and it's aptly termed traumatic insemination. Males have a spiked  barbed penis that they literally stab into the female  and they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina. They stab it anywhere in her body  and the sperm simply migrates through her hemolymph to her ovaries. If a female gets too many stab wounds  or if a stab wound happens to become infected  she can actually die from it. Now if you've ever been out for a nice  peaceful walk by the lake and happened to see some ducks having sex  you've undoubtedly been alarmed  because it looks like gang rape. And quite frankly  that's exactly what it is. A group of males will grab a female  hold her down  and ballistically ejaculate their spiral shaped penis into her corkscrew shaped vagina over and over and over again. From flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second. Now the female actually gets the last laugh  though  because she can actually manipulate her posture so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors better access to her ovaries. Now  I like to share stories like this with my audiences because  yeah  we humans  we tend to think sex  sex is fun  sex is good  there's romance  and there's orgasm. But orgasm didn't actually evolve until about    million years ago with the advent of mammals. But some animals had it going on quite a bit before that. There are some more primitive ways of pleasing one's partner. Earwig males have either really large penile appendages or really small ones. It's a very simple genetically inherited trait and the males are not otherwise any different. Those that have long penile appendages are not bigger or stronger or otherwise any different at all. So going back to our biological minds  then  we might think that females should choose to have sex with the guys that have the shorter appendages  because she can use her time for other things  avoiding predators  taking care of young  finding and ingesting food. But biologists have repeatedly observed that females choose to have sex with the males that have the long appendages. Why do they do this  Well  according to the biological literature   During copulation  the genitalia of certain males may elicit more favorable female responses through superior mechanical or stimulatory interaction with the female reproductive tract.  Mm hm. These are Mexican guppies  and what you see on their upper maxilla is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments  and these filaments basically form a fish mustache  if you will. Now males have been observed to prod the female's genital opening prior to copulating with her  and in what I have lovingly termed the Magnum  P.I. hypothesis  females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found with males that have these fish mustaches. A little guppy porn for you right there. So we've seen very different strategies that males are using when it comes to winning a female partner. We've seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex. We've also seen a titillation strategy where males are actually pleasing their female partners into choosing them as a sex partner. Now unfortunately  in the animal kingdom  it's the coercion strategy that we see time and time again. It's very common in many phyla  from invertebrates to avian species  mammals  and  of course  even in primates. Now interestingly  there  are a few mammalian species in which females have evolved specialized genitalia that doesn't allow for sexual coercion to take place. Female elephants and female hyenas have a penile clitoris  or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally  much like a penis  and in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals by merely looking at their external morphology. So before a male can insert his penis into a female's vagina  she has to take this penile clitoris and basically inside out it in her own body. I mean  imagine putting a penis into another penis. It's simply not going to happen unless the female is on board with the action. Now  even more interesting is the fact that elephant and hyena societies are entirely matriarchal  they're run by females  groups of females  sisters  aunts and offspring  and when young males attain sexual maturity  they're turfed out of the group. In hyena societies  adult males are actually the lowest on the social scale. They can take part in a kill only after everybody else  including the offspring. So it seems that when you take the penis power away from a male  you take away all the social power he has. So what are my take home messages from my talk today  Well  sex is just so much more than insert part A into slot B and hope that the offspring run around everywhere. The sexual strategies and reproductive structures that we see in the animal kingdom basically dictate how males and females will react to each other  which then dictates how populations and societies form and evolve. So it may not be surprising to any of you that animals  including ourselves  spend a good amount of time thinking about sex  but what might surprise you is the extent to which so many other aspects of their lives and our lives are influenced by it. So thank you  and happy daydreaming.   Rebecca Newberger Goldstein     Steven Pinker     The Long Reach of Reason   Cabbie  Twenty two dollars. Steven Pinker  Okay. Rebecca Newberger Goldstein  Reason  appears to have fallen on hard times  Popular culture plumbs new depths of dumbth and political discourse has become a race to the bottom. We're living in an era of scientific creationism       conspiracy theories  psychic hotlines  and a resurgence of religious fundamentalism. People who think too well are often accused of elitism  and even in the academy  there are attacks on logocentrism  the crime of letting logic dominate our thinking. SP  But is this necessarily a bad thing  Perhaps reason is overrated. Many pundits have argued that a good heart and steadfast moral clarity are superior to triangulations of overeducated policy wonks  like the best and brightest and that dragged us into the quagmire of Vietnam. And wasn't it reason that gave us the means to despoil the planet and threaten our species with weapons of mass destruction  In this way of thinking   it's character and conscience  not cold hearted calculation  that will save us. Besides  a human being is not a brain on a stick. My fellow psychologists have shown that we're led by our bodies and our emotions and use our puny powers of reason merely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact. RNG  How could a reasoned argument logically entail the ineffectiveness of reasoned arguments  Look  you're trying to persuade us of reason's impotence. You're not threatening us or bribing us  suggesting that we resolve the issue with a show of hands or a beauty contest. By the very act of trying to reason us into your position  you're conceding reason's potency. Reason isn't up for grabs here. It can't be. You show up for that debate and you've already lost it. SP  But can reason lead us in directions that are good or decent or moral  After all  you pointed out that reason is just a means to an end  and the end depends on the reasoner's passions. Reason can lay out a road map to peace and harmony if the reasoner wants peace and harmony  but it can also lay out a road map to conflict and strife if the reasoner delights in conflict and strife. Can reason force the reasoner to want less cruelty and waste  RNG  All on its own  the answer is no  but it doesn't take much to switch it to yes. You need two conditions  The first is that reasoners all care about their own well being. That's one of the passions that has to be present in order for reason to go to work  and it's obviously present in all of us. We all care passionately about our own well being. The second condition is that reasoners are members of a community of reasoners who can affect one another's well being  can exchange messages  and comprehend each other's reasoning. And that's certainly true of our gregarious and loquatious species  well endowed with the instinct for language. SP  Well  that sounds good in theory  but has it worked that way in practice  In particular  can it explain a momentous historical development that I spoke about five years ago here at TED  Namely  we seem to be getting more humane. Centuries ago  our ancestors would burn cats alive as a form of popular entertainment. Knights waged constant war on each other by trying to kill as many of each other's peasants as possible. Governments executed people for frivolous reasons  like stealing a cabbage or criticizing the royal garden. The executions were designed to be as prolonged and as painful as possible  like crucifixion  disembowelment  breaking on the wheel. Respectable people kept slaves. For all our flaws  we have abandoned these barbaric practices. RNG  So  do you think it's human nature that's changed  SP  Not exactly. I think we still harbor instincts that can erupt in violence  like greed  tribalism  revenge  dominance  sadism. But we also have instincts that can steer us away  like self control  empathy  a sense of fairness  what Abraham Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. RNG  So if human nature didn't change  what invigorated those better angels  SP  Well  among other things  our circle of empathy expanded. Years ago  our ancestors would feel the pain only of their family and people in their village. But with the expansion of literacy and travel  people started to sympathize with wider and wider circles  the clan  the tribe  the nation  the race  and perhaps eventually  all of humanity. RNG  Can hard headed scientists really give so much credit to soft hearted empathy  SP  They can and do. Neurophysiologists have found neurons in the brain that respond to other people's actions the same way they respond to our own. Empathy emerges early in life  perhaps before the age of one. Books on empathy have become bestsellers  like  The Empathic Civilization  and  The Age of Empathy.  RNG  I'm all for empathy. I mean  who isn't  But all on its own  it's a feeble instrument for making moral progress. For one thing  it's innately biased toward blood relations  babies and warm  fuzzy animals. As far as empathy is concerned  ugly outsiders can go to hell. And even our best attempts to work up sympathy for those who are unconnected with us fall miserably short  a sad truth about human nature that was pointed out by Adam Smith. Adam Smith  Let us suppose that the great empire of China was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake  and let us consider how a  man of humanity in Europe would react on receiving intelligence of this dreadful calamity. He would  I imagine  first of all express very strongly his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people. He would make many melancholy reflections upon the precariousness of human life  and when all these humane sentiments had been once fairly expressed  he would pursue his business or his pleasure with the same ease and tranquility as if no such accident had happened. If he was to lose his little finger tomorrow  he would not sleep tonight  but provided he never saw them  he would snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred million of his brethren. SP  But if empathy wasn't enough to make us more humane  what else was there  RNG  Well  you didn't mention what might be one of our most effective better angels  reason. Reason has muscle. It's reason that provides the push to widen that circle of empathy. Every one of the humanitarian developments that you mentioned originated with thinkers who gave reasons for why some practice was indefensible. They demonstrated that the way people treated some particular group of others was logically inconsistent with the way they insisted on being treated themselves. SP  Are you saying that reason can actually change people's minds  Don't people just stick with whatever conviction serves their interests or conforms to the culture that they grew up in  RNG  Here's a fascinating fact about us  Contradictions bother us  at least when we're forced to confront them  which is just another way of saying that we are susceptible to reason. And if you look at the history of moral progress  you can trace a direct pathway from reasoned arguments to changes in the way that we actually feel. Time and again  a thinker would lay out an argument as to why some practice was indefensible  irrational  inconsistent with values already held. Their essay would go viral  get translated into many languages  get debated at pubs and coffee houses and salons  and at dinner parties  and influence leaders  legislators  popular opinion. Eventually their conclusions get absorbed into the common sense of decency  erasing the tracks of the original argument that had gotten us there. Few of us today feel any need to put forth a rigorous philosophical argument as to why slavery is wrong or public hangings or beating children. By now  these things just feel wrong. But just those arguments had to be made  and they were  in centuries past. SP  Are you saying that people needed a step by step argument to grasp why something might be a wee bit wrong with burning heretics at the stake  RNG  Oh  they did. Here's the French theologian Sebastian Castellio making the case. Sebastian Castellio  Calvin says that he's certain  and other sects say that they are. Who shall be judge  If the matter is certain  to whom is it so  To Calvin  But then  why does he write so many books about manifest truth  In view of the uncertainty  we must define heretics simply as one with whom we disagree. And if then we are going to kill heretics  the logical outcome will be a war of extermination  since each is sure of himself. SP  Or with hideous punishments like breaking on the wheel  RNG  The prohibition in our constitution of cruel and unusual punishments was a response to a pamphlet circulated in      by the Italian jurist Cesare Beccaria. Cesare Beccaria  As punishments become more cruel  the minds of men  which like fluids always adjust to the level of the objects that surround them  become hardened  and after a hundred years of cruel punishments  breaking on the wheel causes no more fear than imprisonment previously did. For a punishment to achieve its objective  it is only necessary that the harm that it inflicts outweighs the benefit that derives from the crime  and into this calculation ought to be factored the certainty of punishment and the loss of the good that the commission of the crime will produce. Everything beyond this is superfluous  and therefore tyrannical. SP  But surely antiwar movements depended on mass demonstrations and catchy tunes by folk singers and wrenching photographs of the human costs of war. RNG  No doubt  but modern anti war movements reach back to a long chain of thinkers who had argued as to why we ought to mobilize our emotions against war  such as the father of modernity  Erasmus. Erasmus  The advantages derived from peace diffuse themselves far and wide  and reach great numbers  while in war  if anything turns out happily  the advantage redounds only to a few  and those unworthy of reaping it. One man's safety is owing to the destruction of another. One man's prize is derived from the plunder of another. The cause of rejoicings made by one side is to the other a cause of mourning. Whatever is unfortunate in war  is severely so indeed  and whatever  on the contrary  is called good fortune  is a savage and a cruel good fortune  an ungenerous happiness deriving its existence from another's woe. SP  But everyone knows that the movement to abolish slavery depended on faith and emotion. It was a movement spearheaded by the Quakers  and it only became popular when Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel  Uncle Tom's Cabin  became a bestseller. RNG  But the ball got rolling a century before. John Locke bucked the tide of millennia that had regarded the practice as perfectly natural. He argued that it was inconsistent with the principles of rational government. John Locke  Freedom of men under government is to have a standing rule to live by common to everyone of that society and made by the legislative power erected in it  a liberty to follow my own will in all things where that rule prescribes not  not to be subject to the inconstant  uncertain  unknown  arbitrary will of another man  as freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint but the law of nature. SP  Those words sound familiar. Where have I read them before  Ah  yes. Mary Astell  If absolute sovereignty  be not necessary in a state  how comes it to be so in a family  Or if in a family  why not in a state  Since no reason can be alleged for the one that will not hold more strongly for the other  if all men are born free  how is it that all women are born slaves  as they must be if being subjected to the inconstant  uncertain  unknown  arbitrary will of men be the perfect condition of slavery  RNG  That sort of co option is all in the job description of reason. One movement for the expansion of rights inspires another because the logic is the same  and once that's hammered home  it becomes increasingly uncomfortable to ignore the inconsistency. In the     s  the Civil Rights Movement inspired the movements for women's rights  children's rights  gay rights and even animal rights. But fully two centuries before  the Enlightenment thinker Jeremy Bentham had exposed the indefensibility of customary practices such as the cruelty to animals. Jeremy Bentham  The question is not  can they reason  nor can they talk  but can they suffer  RNG  And the persecution of homosexuals. JB  As to any primary mischief  it's evident that it produces no pain in anyone. On the contrary  it produces pleasure. The partners are both willing. If either of them be unwilling  the act is an offense  totally different in its nature of effects. It's a personal injury. It's a kind of rape. As to the any danger exclusive of pain  the danger  if any  much consist in the tendency of the example. But what is the tendency of this example  To dispose others to engage in the same practices. But this practice produces not pain of any kind to anyone. SP  Still  in every case  it took at least a century for the arguments of these great thinkers to trickle down and infiltrate the population as a whole. It kind of makes you wonder about our own time. Are there practices that we engage in where the arguments against them are there for all to see but nonetheless we persist in them  RNG  When our great grandchildren look back at us  will they be as appalled by some of our practices as we are by our slave owning  heretic burning  wife beating  gay bashing ancestors  SP  I'm sure everyone here could think of an example. RNG  I opt for the mistreatment of animals in factory farms. SP  The imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders and the toleration of rape in our nation's prisons. RNG  Scrimping on donations to life saving charities in the developing world. SP  The possession of nuclear weapons. RNG  The appeal to religion to justify the otherwise unjustifiable  such as the ban on contraception. SP  What about religious faith in general  RNG  Eh  I'm not holding my breath. SP  Still  I have become convinced that reason is a better angel that deserves the greatest credit for the moral progress our species has enjoyed and that holds out the greatest hope for continuing moral progress in the future. RNG  And if  our friends  you detect a flaw in this argument  just remember you'll be depending on reason to point it out. Thank you. SP  Thank you. I'd like to talk today about how we can change our brains and our society. Meet Joe. Joe's    years old and a murderer. I met Joe    years ago on the lifer wing at Wormwood Scrubs high security prison in London. I'd like you to imagine this place. It looks and feels like it sounds  Wormwood Scrubs. Built at the end of the Victorian Era by the inmates themselves  it is where England's most dangerous prisoners are kept. These individuals have committed acts of unspeakable evil. And I was there to study their brains. I was part of a team of researchers from University College London  on a grant from the U.K. department of health. My task was to study a group of inmates who had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths. That meant they were the most callous and the most aggressive of the entire prison population. What lay at the root of their behavior  Was there a neurological cause for their condition  And if there was a neurological cause  could we find a cure  So I'd like to speak about change  and  especially about emotional change. Growing up  I was always intrigued by how people change. My mother  a clinical psychotherapist  would occasionally see patients at home in the evening. She would shut the door to the living room  and I imagined magical things happened in that room. At the age of five or six I would creep up in my pajamas and sit outside with my ear glued to the door. On more than one occasion  I fell asleep and they had to push me out of the way at the end of the session. And I suppose that's how I found myself walking into the secure interview room on my first day at Wormwood Scrubs. Joe sat across a steel table and greeted me with this blank expression. The prison warden  looking equally indifferent  said   Any trouble  just press the red buzzer  and we'll be around as soon as we can.  I sat down. The heavy metal door slammed shut behind me. I looked up at the red buzzer far behind Joe on the opposite wall. I looked at Joe. Perhaps detecting my concern  he leaned forward  and said  as reassuringly as he could   Ah  don't worry about the buzzer  it doesn't work anyway.  Over the subsequent months  we tested Joe and his fellow inmates  looking specifically at their ability to categorize different images of emotion. And we looked at their physical response to those emotions. So  for example  when most of us look at a picture like this of somebody looking sad  we instantly have a slight  measurable physical response  increased heart rate  sweating of the skin. Whilst the psychopaths in our study were able to describe the pictures accurately  they failed to show the emotions required. They failed to show a physical response. It was as though they knew the words but not the music of empathy. So we wanted to look closer at this to use MRI to image their brains. That turned out to be not such an easy task. Imagine transporting a collection of clinical psychopaths across central London in shackles and handcuffs in rush hour  and in order to place each of them in an MRI scanner  you have to remove all metal objects  including shackles and handcuffs  and  as I learned  all body piercings. After some time  however  we had a tentative answer. These individuals were not just the victims of a troubled childhood. There was something else. People like Joe have a deficit in a brain area called the amygdala. The amygdala is an almond shaped organ deep within each of the hemispheres of the brain. It is thought to be key to the experience of empathy. Normally  the more empathic a person is  the larger and more active their amygdala is. Our population of inmates had a deficient amygdala  which likely led to their lack of empathy and to their immoral behavior. So let's take a step back. Normally  acquiring moral behavior is simply part of growing up  like learning to speak. At the age of six months  virtually every one of us is able to differentiate between animate and inanimate objects. At the age of    months  most children are able to imitate the purposeful actions of others. So for example  your mother raises her hands to stretch  and you imitate her behavior. At first  this isn't perfect. I remember my cousin Sasha  two years old at the time  looking through a picture book and licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand  licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand. Bit by bit  we build the foundations  of the social brain so that by the time we're three  four years old  most children  not all  have acquired the ability to understand the intentions of others  another prerequisite for empathy. The fact that this developmental progression is universal  irrespective of where you live in the world or which culture you inhabit  strongly suggests that the foundations of moral behavior are inborn. If you doubt this  try  as I've done  to renege on a promise you've made to a four year old. You will find that the mind of a four year old is not na ve in the slightest. It is more akin to a Swiss army knife with fixed mental modules finely honed during development and a sharp sense of fairness. The early years are crucial. There seems to be a window of opportunity  after which mastering moral questions becomes more difficult  like adults learning a foreign language. That's not to say it's impossible. A recent  wonderful study from Stanford University showed that people who have played a virtual reality game in which they took on the role of a good and helpful superhero actually became more caring and helpful towards others afterwards. Now I'm not suggesting we endow criminals with superpowers  but I am suggesting that we need to find ways to get Joe and people like him to change their brains and their behavior  for their benefit and for the benefit of the rest of us. So can brains change  For over     years  neuroanatomists and later neuroscientists held the view that after initial development in childhood  no new brain cells could grow in the adult human brain. The brain could only change within certain set limits. That was the dogma. But then  in the     s  studies starting showing  following the lead of Elizabeth Gould at Princeton and others  studies started showing the evidence of neurogenesis  the birth of new brain cells in the adult mammalian brain  first in the olfactory bulb  which is responsible for our sense of smell  then in the hippocampus involving short term memory  and finally in the amygdala itself. In order to understand how this process works  I left the psychopaths and joined a lab in Oxford specializing in learning and development. Instead of psychopaths  I studied mice  because the same pattern of brain responses appears across many different species of social animals. So if you rear a mouse in a standard cage  a shoebox  essentially  with cotton wool  alone and without much stimulation  not only does it not thrive  but it will often develop strange  repetitive behaviors. This naturally sociable animal will lose its ability to bond with other mice  even becoming aggressive when introduced to them. However  mice reared in what we called an enriched environment  a large habitation with other mice with wheels and ladders and areas to explore  demonstrate neurogenesis  the birth of new brain cells  and as we showed  they also perform better on a range of learning and memory tasks. Now  they don't develop morality to the point of carrying the shopping bags of little old mice across the street  but their improved environment results in healthy  sociable behavior. Mice reared in a standard cage  by contrast  not dissimilar  you might say  from a prison cell  have dramatically lower levels of new neurons in the brain. It is now clear that the amygdala of mammals  including primates like us  can show neurogenesis. In some areas of the brain  more than    percent of cells are newly formed. We're just beginning to understand what exact function these cells have  but what it implies is that the brain is capable of extraordinary change way into adulthood. However  our brains are also exquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment. Stress hormones  glucocorticoids  released by the brain  suppress the growth of these new cells. The more stress  the less brain development  which in turn causes less adaptability and causes higher stress levels. This is the interplay between nature and nurture in real time in front of our eyes. When you think about it  it is ironic that our current solution for people with stressed amygdalae is to place them in an environment that actually inhibits any chance of further growth. Of course  imprisonment is a necessary part of the criminal justice system and of protecting society. Our research does not suggest that criminals should submit their MRI scans as evidence in court and get off the hook because they've got a faulty amygdala. The evidence is actually the other way. Because our brains are capable of change  we need to take responsibility for our actions  and they need to take responsibility for their rehabilitation. One way such rehabilitation might work is through restorative justice programs. Here victims  if they choose to participate  and perpetrators meet face to face in safe  structured encounters  and the perpetrator is encouraged to take responsibility for their actions  and the victim plays an active role in the process. In such a setting  the perpetrator can see  perhaps for the first time  the victim as a real person with thoughts and feelings and a genuine emotional response. This stimulates the amygdala and may be a more effective rehabilitative practice than simple incarceration. Such programs won't work for everyone  but for many  it could be a way to break the frozen sea within. So what can we do now  How can we apply this knowledge  I'd like to leave you with three lessons that I learned. The first thing that I learned was that we need to change our mindset. Since Wormwood Scrubs was built     years ago  society has advanced in virtually every aspect  in the way we run our schools  our hospitals. Yet the moment we speak about prisons  it's as though we're back in Dickensian times  if not medieval times. For too long  I believe  we've allowed ourselves to be persuaded of the false notion that human  nature cannot change  and as a society  it's costing us dearly. We know that the brain is capable of extraordinary change  and the best way to achieve that  even in adults  is to change and modulate our environment. The second thing I have learned is that we need to create an alliance of people who believe that science is integral to bringing about social change. It's easy enough for a neuroscientist to place a high security inmate in an MRI scanner. Well actually  that turns out not to be so easy  but ultimately what we want to show is whether we're able to reduce the reoffending rates. In order to answer complex questions like that  we need people of different backgrounds    lab based scientists and clinicians  social workers and policy makers  philanthropists and human rights activists   to work together. Finally  I believe we need to change our own amygdalae  because this issue goes to the heart not just of who Joe is  but who we are. We need to change our view of Joe as someone wholly irredeemable  because if we see Joe as wholly irredeemable  how is he going to see himself as any different  In another decade  Joe will be released from Wormwood Scrubs. Will he be among the    percent of inmates who end up reoffending and returning to the prison system  Wouldn't it be better if  while serving his sentence  Joe was able to train his amygdala  which would stimulate the growth of new brain cells and connections  so that he will be able to face the world once he gets released  Surely  that would be in the interest of all of us. Thank you.  Applause  Chris Anderson  The rights of citizens  the future of the Internet. So I would like to welcome to the TED stage the man behind those revelations  Ed Snowden. Ed is in a remote location somewhere in Russia controlling this bot from his laptop  so he can see what the bot can see. Ed  welcome to the TED stage. What can you see  as a matter of fact  Edward Snowden  Ha  I can see everyone. This is amazing. CA  Ed  some questions for you. You've been called many things in the last few months. You've been called a whistleblower  a traitor  a hero. What words would you describe yourself with  ES  You know  everybody who is involved with this debate has been struggling over me and my personality and how to describe me. But when I think about it  this isn't the question that we should be struggling with. Who I am really doesn't matter at all. If I'm the worst person in the world  you can hate me and move on. What really matters here are the issues. What really matters here is the kind of government we want  the kind of Internet we want  the kind of relationship between people and societies. And that's what I'm hoping the debate will move towards  and we've seen that increasing over time. If I had to describe myself  I wouldn't use words like  hero.  I wouldn't use  patriot   and I wouldn't use  traitor.  I'd say I'm an American and I'm a citizen  just like everyone else. CA  So just to give some context for those who don't know the whole story    this time a year ago  you were stationed in Hawaii working as a consultant to the NSA. As a sysadmin  you had access to their systems  and you began revealing certain classified documents to some handpicked journalists leading the way to June's revelations. Now  what propelled you to do this  ES  You know  when I was sitting in Hawaii  and the years before  when I was working in the intelligence community  I saw a lot of things that had disturbed me. We do a lot of good things in the intelligence community  things that need to be done  and things that help everyone. But there are also things that go too far. There are things that shouldn't be done  and decisions that were being made in secret without the public's awareness  without the public's consent  and without even our representatives in government having knowledge of these programs. When I really came to struggle with these issues  I thought to myself  how can I do this in the most responsible way  that maximizes the public benefit while minimizing the risks  And out of all the solutions that I could come up with  out of going to Congress  when there were no laws  there were no legal protections for a private employee  a contractor in intelligence like myself  there was a risk that I would be buried along with the information and the public would never find out. But the First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees us a free press for a reason  and that's to enable an adversarial press  to challenge the government  but also to work together with the government  to have a dialogue and debate about how we can inform the public about matters of vital importance without putting our national security at risk. And by working with journalists  by giving all of my information back to the American people  rather than trusting myself to make the decisions about publication  we've had a robust debate with a deep investment by the government that I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone. And the risks that have been threatened  the risks that have been played up by the government have never materialized. We've never seen any evidence of even a single instance of specific harm  and because of that  I'm comfortable with the decisions that I made. CA  So let me show the audience a couple of examples of what you revealed. If we could have a slide up  and Ed  I don't know whether you can see  the slides are here. This is a slide of the PRISM program  and maybe you could tell the audience what that was that was revealed. ES  The best way to understand PRISM  because there's been a little bit of controversy  is to first talk about what PRISM isn't. Much of the debate in the U.S. has been about metadata. They've said it's just metadata  it's just metadata  and they're talking about a specific legal authority called Section     of the Patriot Act. That allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping  mass surveillance of the entire country's phone records  things like that    who you're talking to  when you're talking to them  where you traveled. These are all metadata events. PRISM is about content. It's a program through which the government could compel corporate America  it could deputize corporate America to do its dirty work for the NSA. And even though some of these companies did resist  even though some of them    I believe Yahoo was one of them   challenged them in court  they all lost  because it was never tried by an open court. They were only tried by a secret court. And something that we've seen  something about the PRISM program that's very concerning to me is  there's been a talking point in the U.S. government where they've said    federal judges have reviewed these programs and found them to be lawful  but what they don't tell you is those are secret judges in a secret court based on secret interpretations of law that's considered        warrant requests over    years  and in    years only rejected    government requests. These aren't the people that we want deciding what the role of corporate America in a free and open Internet should be. CA  Now  this slide that we're showing here shows the dates in which different technology companies  Internet companies  are alleged to have joined the program  and where data collection began from them. Now  they have denied collaborating with the NSA. How was that data collected by the NSA  ES  Right. So the NSA's own slides refer to it as direct access. What that means to an actual NSA analyst  someone like me who was working as an intelligence analyst targeting  Chinese cyber hackers  things like that  in Hawaii  is the provenance of that data is directly from their servers. It doesn't mean that there's a group of company representatives sitting in a smoky room with the NSA palling around and making back room deals about how they're going to give this stuff away. Now each company handles it different ways. Some are responsible. Some are somewhat less responsible. But the bottom line is  when we talk about how this information is given  it's coming from the companies themselves. It's not stolen from the lines. But there's an important thing to remember here  even though companies pushed back  even though companies demanded  hey  let's do this through a warrant process  let's do this where we actually have some sort of legal review  some sort of basis for handing over these users' data  we saw stories in the Washington Post last year that weren't as well reported as the PRISM story that said the NSA broke in to the data center communications between Google to itself and Yahoo to itself. So even these companies that are cooperating in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner with the NSA  the NSA isn't satisfied with that  and because of that  we need our companies to work very hard to guarantee that they're going to represent the interests of the user  and also advocate for the rights of the users. And I think over the last year  we've seen the companies that are named on the PRISM slides take great strides to do that  and I encourage them to continue. CA  What more should they do  ES  The biggest thing that an Internet company in America can do today  right now  without consulting with lawyers  to protect the rights of users worldwide  is to enable SSL web encryption on every page you visit. The reason this matters is today  if you go to look at a copy of        on Amazon.com  the NSA can see a record of that  the Russian intelligence service can see a record of that  the Chinese service can see a record of that  the French service  the German service  the services of Andorra. They can all see it because it's unencrypted. The world's library is Amazon.com  but not only do they not support encryption by default  you cannot choose to use encryption when browsing through books. This is something that we need to change  not just for Amazon  I don't mean to single them out  but they're a great example. All companies need to move to an encrypted browsing habit by default for all users who haven't taken any action or picked any special methods on their own. That'll increase the privacy and the rights that people enjoy worldwide. CA  Ed  come with me to this part of the stage. I want to show you the next slide here.  Applause  This is a program called Boundless Informant. What is that  ES  So  I've got to give credit to the NSA for using appropriate names on this. This is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms. Boundless Informant is a program that the NSA hid from Congress. The NSA was previously asked by Congress  was there any ability that they had to even give a rough ballpark estimate of the amount of American communications that were being intercepted. They said no. They said  we don't track those stats  and we can't track those stats. We can't tell you how many communications we're intercepting around the world  because to tell you that would be to invade your privacy. Now  I really appreciate that sentiment from them  but the reality  when you look at this slide is  not only do they have the capability  the capability already exists. It's already in place. The NSA has its own internal data format that tracks both ends of a communication  and if it says  this communication came from America  they can tell Congress how many of those communications they have today  right now. And what Boundless Informant tells us is more communications are being intercepted in America about Americans than there are in Russia about Russians. I'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency should be aiming for. CA  Ed  there was a story broken in the Washington Post  again from your data. The headline says   NSA broke privacy rules thousands of times per year.  Tell us about that. ES  We also heard in Congressional testimony last year  it was an amazing thing for someone like me who came from the NSA and who's seen the actual internal documents  knows what's in them  to see officials testifying under oath that there had been no abuses  that there had been no violations of the NSA's rules  when we knew this story was coming. But what's especially interesting about this  about the fact that the NSA has violated their own rules  their own laws thousands of times in a single year  including one event by itself  one event out of those        that affected more than       people. In another event  they intercepted all the calls in Washington  D.C.  by accident. What's amazing about this  this report  that didn't get that much attention  is the fact that not only were there       abuses  the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee  Dianne Feinstein  had not seen this report until the Washington Post contacted her asking for comment on the report. And she then requested a copy from the NSA and received it  but had never seen this before that. What does that say about the state of oversight in American intelligence when the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has no idea that the rules are being broken thousands of times every year  CA  Ed  one response to this whole debate is this  Why should we care about all this surveillance  honestly  I mean  look  if you've done nothing wrong  you've got nothing to worry about. What's wrong with that point of view  ES  Well  so the first thing is  you're giving up your rights. You're saying hey  you know  I don't think I'm going to need them  so I'm just going to trust that  you know  let's get rid of them  it doesn't really matter  these guys are going to do the right thing. Your rights matter because you never know when you're going to need them. Beyond that  it's a part of our cultural identity  not just in America  but in Western societies and in democratic societies around the world. People should be able to pick up the phone and to call their family  people should be able to send a text message to their loved ones  people should be able to buy a book online  they should be able to travel by train  they should be able to buy an airline ticket without wondering about how these events are going to look to an agent of the government  possibly not even your government years in the future  how they're going to be misinterpreted and what they're going to think your intentions were. We have a right to privacy. We require warrants to be based on probable cause or some kind of individualized suspicion because we recognize that trusting anybody  any government authority  with the entirety of human communications in secret and without oversight is simply too great a temptation to be ignored. CA  Some people are furious at what you've done. I heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney who said that Julian Assange was a flea bite  Edward Snowden is the lion that bit the head off the dog. He thinks you've committed one of the worst acts of betrayal in American history. What would you say to people who think that  ES  Dick Cheney's really something else. Thank you.  Laughter  I think it's amazing  because at the time Julian Assange was doing some of his greatest work  Dick Cheney was saying he was going to end governments worldwide  the skies were going to ignite and the seas were going to boil off  and now he's saying it's a flea bite. So we should be suspicious about the same sort of overblown claims of damage to national security from these kind of officials. But let's assume that these people really believe this. I would argue that they have kind of a narrow conception of national security. The prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney do not keep the nation safe. The public interest is not always the same as the national interest. Going to war with people who are not our enemy in places that are not a threat doesn't make us safe  and that applies whether it's in Iraq or on the Internet. The Internet is not the enemy. Our economy is not the enemy. American businesses  Chinese businesses  and any other company out there is a part of our society. It's a part of our interconnected world. There are ties of fraternity that bond us together  and if we destroy these bonds by undermining the standards  the security  the manner of behavior  that nations and citizens all around the world expect us to abide by. CA  But it's alleged that you've stolen  .  million documents. It seems only a few hundred of them have been shared with journalists so far. Are there more revelations to come  ES  There are absolutely more revelations to come. I don't think there's any question that some of the most important reporting to be done is yet to come. CA  Come here  because I want to ask you about this particular revelation. Come and take a look at this. I mean  this is a story which I think for a lot of the techies in this room is the single most shocking thing that they have heard in the last few months. It's about a program called  Bullrun.  Can you explain what that is  ES  So Bullrun  and this is again where we've got to thank the NSA for their candor  this is a program named after a Civil War battle. The British counterpart is called Edgehill  which is a U.K. civil war battle. And the reason that I believe they're named this way is because they target our own infrastructure. They're programs through which the NSA intentionally misleads corporate partners. They tell corporate partners that these are safe standards. They say hey  we need to work with you to secure your systems  but in reality  they're giving bad advice to these companies that makes them degrade the security of their services. They're building in backdoors that not only the NSA can exploit  but anyone else who has time and money to research and find it can then use to let themselves in to the world's communications. And this is really dangerous  because if we lose a single standard  if we lose the trust of something like SSL  which was specifically targeted by the Bullrun program  we will live a less safe world overall. We won't be able to access our banks and we won't be able to access commerce without worrying about people monitoring those communications or subverting them for their own ends. CA  And do those same decisions also potentially open America up to cyberattacks from other sources  ES  Absolutely. One of the problems  one of the dangerous legacies that we've seen in the post      era  is that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats. They've been in charge of offensive operations  that is hacking  but they've also been in charge of defensive operations  and traditionally they've always prioritized defense over offense based on the principle that American secrets are simply worth more. If we hack a Chinese business and steal their secrets  if we hack a government office in Berlin and steal their secrets  that has less value to the American people than making sure that the Chinese can't get access to our secrets. So by reducing the security of our communications  they're not only putting the world at risk  they're putting America at risk in a fundamental way  because intellectual property is the basis  the foundation of our economy  and if we put that at risk through weak security  we're going to be paying for it for years. CA  But they've made a calculation that it was worth doing this as part of America's defense against terrorism. Surely that makes it a price worth paying. ES  Well  when you look at the results of these programs in stopping terrorism  you will see that that's unfounded  and you don't have to take my word for it  because we've had the first open court  the first federal court that's reviewed this  outside the secrecy arrangement  called these programs Orwellian and likely unconstitutional. Congress  who has access to be briefed on these things  and now has the desire to be  has produced bills to reform it  and two independent White House panels who reviewed all of the classified evidence said these programs have never stopped a single terrorist attack that was imminent in the United States. So is it really terrorism that we're stopping  Do these programs have any value at all  I say no  and all three branches of the American government say no as well. CA  I mean  do you think there's a deeper motivation for them than the war against terrorism  ES  I'm sorry  I couldn't hear you  say again  CA  Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation for them other than the war against terrorism  ES  Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism has always been what we in the intelligence world would call a cover for action. Terrorism is something that provokes an emotional response that allows people to rationalize authorizing powers and programs that they wouldn't give otherwise. The Bullrun and Edgehill type programs  the NSA asked for these authorities back in the     s. They asked the FBI to go to Congress and make the case. The FBI went to Congress and did make the case. But Congress and the American people said no. They said  it's not worth the risk to our economy. They said it's worth too much damage to our society to justify the gains. But what we saw is  in the post      era  they used secrecy and they used the justification of terrorism to start these programs in secret without asking Congress  without asking the American people  and it's that kind of government behind closed doors that we need to guard ourselves against  because it makes us less safe  and it offers no value. CA  Okay  come with me here for a sec  because I've got a more personal question for you. Speaking of terror  most people would find the situation you're in right now in Russia pretty terrifying. You obviously heard what happened  what the treatment that Bradley Manning got  Chelsea Manning as now is  and there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that there are people in the intelligence community who want you dead. How are you coping with this  How are you coping with the fear  ES  It's no mystery that there are governments out there that want to see me dead. I've made clear again and again and again that I go to sleep every morning thinking about what I can do for the American people. I don't want to harm my government. I want to help my government  but the fact that they are willing to completely ignore due process  they're willing to declare guilt without ever seeing a trial  these are things that we need to work against as a society  and say hey  this is not appropriate. We shouldn't be threatening dissidents. We shouldn't be criminalizing journalism. And whatever part I can do to see that end  I'm happy to do despite the risks. CA  So I'd actually like to get some feedback from the audience here  because I know there's widely differing reactions to Edward Snowden. Suppose you had the following two choices  right  You could view what he did as fundamentally a reckless act that has endangered America or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act that will work towards America and the world's long term good  Those are the two choices I'll give you. I'm curious to see who's willing to vote with the first of those  that this was a reckless act  There are some hands going up. Some hands going up. It's hard to put your hand up when the man is standing right here  but I see them. ES  I can see you.  Laughter  CA  And who goes with the second choice  the fundamentally heroic act  And I think it's true to say that there are a lot of people who didn't show a hand and I think are still thinking this through  because it seems to me that the debate around you doesn't split along traditional political lines. It's not left or right  it's not really about pro government  libertarian  or not just that. Part of it is almost a generational issue. You're part of a generation that grew up with the Internet  and it seems as if you become offended at almost a visceral level when you see something done that you think will harm the Internet. Is there some truth to that  ES  It is. I think it's very true. This is not a left or right issue. Our basic freedoms  and when I say our  I don't just mean Americans  I mean people around the world  it's not a partisan issue. These are things that all people believe  and it's up to all of us to protect them  and to people who have seen and enjoyed a free and open Internet  it's up to us to preserve that liberty for the next generation to enjoy  and if we don't change things  if we don't stand up to make the changes we need to do to keep the Internet safe  not just for us but for everyone  we're going to lose that  and that would be a tremendous loss  not just for us  but for the world. CA  Well  I have heard similar language recently from the founder of the world wide web  who I actually think is with us  Sir Tim Berners Lee. Tim  actually  would you like to come up and say  do we have a microphone for Tim  Tim  good to see you. Come up there. Which camp are you in  by the way  traitor  hero  I have a theory on this  but    Tim Berners Lee  I've given much longer answers to that question  but hero  if I have to make the choice between the two. CA  And Ed  I think you've read the proposal that Sir Tim has talked about about a new Magna Carta to take back the Internet. Is that something that makes sense  ES  Absolutely. I mean  my generation  I grew up not just thinking about the Internet  but I grew up in the Internet  and although I never expected to have the chance to defend it in such a direct and practical manner and to embody it in this unusual  almost avatar manner  I think there's something poetic about the fact that one of the sons of the Internet has actually become close to the Internet as a result of their political expression. And I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet is exactly what we need. We need to encode our values not just in writing but in the structure of the Internet  and it's something that I hope  I invite everyone in the audience  not just here in Vancouver but around the world  to join and participate in. CA  Do you have a question for Ed  TBL  Well  two questions  a general question   CA  Ed  can you still hear us  ES  Yes  I can hear you. CA  Oh  he's back. TBL  The wiretap on your line got a little interfered with for a moment. ES  It's a little bit of an NSA problem. TBL  So  from the    years  stepping back and thinking  what would you think would be the best that we could achieve from all the discussions that we have about the web we want  ES  When we think about in terms of how far we can go  I think that's a question that's really only limited by what we're willing to put into it. I think the Internet that we've enjoyed in the past has been exactly what we as not just a nation but as a people around the world need  and by cooperating  by engaging not just the technical parts of society  but as you said  the users  the people around the world who contribute through the Internet  through social media  who just check the weather  who rely on it every day as a part of their life  to champion that. We'll get not just the Internet we've had  but a better Internet  a better now  something that we can use to build a future that'll be better not just than what we hoped for but anything that we could have imagined. CA  It's    years ago that TED was founded      . A lot of the conversation since then has been along the lines that actually George Orwell got it wrong. It's not Big Brother watching us. We  through the power of the web  and transparency  are now watching Big Brother. Your revelations kind of drove a stake through the heart of that rather optimistic view  but you still believe there's a way of doing something about that. And you do too. ES  Right  so there is an argument to be made that the powers of Big Brother have increased enormously. There was a recent legal article at Yale that established something called the Bankston Soltani Principle  which is that our expectation of privacy is violated when the capabilities of government surveillance have become cheaper by an order of magnitude  and each time that occurs  we need to revisit and rebalance our privacy rights. Now  that hasn't happened since the government's surveillance powers have increased by several orders of magnitude  and that's why we're in the problem that we're in today  but there is still hope  because the power of individuals have also been increased by technology. I am living proof that an individual can go head to head against the most powerful adversaries and the most powerful intelligence agencies around the world and win  and I think that's something that we need to take hope from  and we need to build on to make it accessible not just to technical experts but to ordinary citizens around the world. Journalism is not a crime  communication is not a crime  and we should not be monitored in our everyday activities. CA  I'm not quite sure how you shake the hand of a bot  but I imagine it's  this is the hand right here. TBL  That'll come very soon. ES  Nice to meet you  and I hope my beam looks as nice as my view of you guys does. CA  Thank you  Tim. I mean  The New York Times recently called for an amnesty for you. Would you welcome the chance to come back to America  ES  Absolutely. There's really no question  the principles that have been the foundation of this project have been the public interest and the principles that underly the journalistic establishment in the United States and around the world  and I think if the press is now saying  we support this  this is something that needed to happen  that's a powerful argument  but it's not the final argument  and I think that's something that public should decide. But at the same time  the government has hinted that they want some kind of deal  that they want me to compromise the journalists with which I've been working  to come back  and I want to make it very clear that I did not do this to be safe. I did this to do what was right  and I'm not going to stop my work in the public interest just to benefit myself. CA  In the meantime  courtesy of the Internet and this technology  you're here  back in North America  not quite the U.S.  Canada  in this form. I'm curious  how does that feel  ES  Canada is different than what I expected. It's a lot warmer. CA  At TED  the mission is  ideas worth spreading.  If you could encapsulate it in a single idea  what is your idea worth spreading right now at this moment  ES  I would say the last year has been a reminder that democracy may die behind closed doors  but we as individuals are born behind those same closed doors  and we don't have to give up our privacy to have good government. We don't have to give up our liberty to have security. And I think by working together we can have both open government and private lives  and I look forward to working with everyone around the world to see that happen. Thank you very much. CA  Ed  thank you. What's the scariest thing you've ever done  Or another way to say it is  what's the most dangerous  thing that you've ever done  And why did you do it  I know what the most dangerous thing is that I've ever done because NASA does the math. You look back to the first five shuttle launches  the odds of a catastrophic event during the first five shuttle launches was one in nine. And even when I first flew in the shuttle back in          shuttle flight  the odds were still now that we look back about one in    or so    one in     one in   . Not great odds  so it's a really interesting day when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center and you're going to go to space that day because you realize by the end of the day you're either going to be floating  effortlessly  gloriously in space  or you'll be dead. You go into  at the Kennedy Space Center  the suit up room  the same room that our childhood heroes got dressed in  that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon. And I got my pressure suit built around me and rode down outside in the van heading out to the launchpad    in the Astro van    heading out to the launchpad  and as you come around the corner at the Kennedy Space Center  it's normally predawn  and in the distance  lit up by the huge xenon lights  is your spaceship    the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet. The crew is sitting in the Astro van sort of hushed  almost holding hands  looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger. We ride the elevator up and we crawl in  on your hands and knees into the spaceship  one at a time  and you worm your way up into your chair and plunk yourself down on your back. And the hatch is closed  and suddenly  what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial is becoming real  something that I dreamed about  in fact  that I chose to do when I was nine years old  is now suddenly within not too many minutes of actually happening. In the astronaut business    the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle  it's the most complicated flying machine ever built. And in the astronaut business   we have a saying  which is  there is no problem so bad that you can't make it worse. And so you're very conscious in the cockpit  you're thinking about all of the things that you might have to do  all the switches and all the  wickets you have to go through. And as the time gets closer and closer  this excitement is building. And then about three and a  half minutes before launch  the huge nozzles on the back  like the size of big church bells  swing back and forth and the mass of them is such that it sways the whole vehicle  like the vehicle is alive underneath you  like an elephant getting up  off its knees or something. And then about    seconds before launch  the vehicle is completely alive    it is ready to go    the APUs are running  the computers are all self contained  it's ready to leave the planet. And    seconds before launch  this happens  nine  eight  seven  six       start  two  one  booster ignition  and liftoff of  the space shuttle Discovery  returning to the space station  paving the way ... Chris Hadfield  It is incredibly powerful to be on board one of these things. You are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself. It's shaking you so hard you can't focus on the instruments in front of you. It's like you're in the jaws of some enormous dog and there's a foot in the small of your back pushing you into space  accelerating wildly straight up  shouldering your way through the air  and you're in a very complex place    paying attention  watching the vehicle go through each one of its wickets with a steadily increasing smile on your face. After two minutes  those solid rockets explode off and then you just have the liquid engines  the hydrogen and oxygen  and it's as if you're in a dragster with your foot to the floor and accelerating like you've never accelerated. You get lighter and lighter  the force gets on us heavier and heavier. It feels like someone's pouring cement on you or something. Until finally  after about eight minutes and    seconds or so  we are finally at exactly the right altitude  exactly the right speed  the right direction  the engine shut off  and we're weightless. And we're alive. It's an amazing experience. But why would we take that risk  Why would you do something that dangerous  In my case the answer is fairly straightforward. I was inspired as a youngster that this was what I wanted to do. I watched the first people walk on the moon and to me  it was just an obvious thing    I want to somehow turn myself into that. But the real question is  how do you deal with the danger of it and the fear that comes from it  How do you deal with fear versus danger  And having the goal in mind  thinking about where it might lead  directed me to a life of looking at all of the small details to allow this to become possible  to be able to launch and go  help build a space station where you are on board a million pound creation that's going around the world at five miles a second  eight kilometers a second  around the world    times a day  with experiments on board that are teaching us what the substance of the universe is made of and running     experiments inside. But maybe even more importantly  allowing us to see the world in a way that is impossible through any other means  to be able to look down and have    if your jaw could drop  it would    the jaw dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb like a self propelled art gallery of fantastic  constantly changing beauty that is the world itself. And you see  because of the speed  a sunrise or a sunset every    minutes for half a year. And the most magnificent part of all that is to go outside on a spacewalk. You are in a one person spaceship that is your spacesuit  and you're going through space with the world. It's an entirely different perspective  you're not looking up at the universe  you and the Earth are going  through the universe together. And you're holding on with one hand  looking at the world turn beside you. It's roaring silently with color and texture as it pours by mesmerizingly next to you. And if you can tear your eyes away from that and you look under your arm down at the rest of everything  it's unfathomable blackness  with a texture you feel like you  could stick your hand into. and you are holding on with one hand  one link to the other seven billion people. And I was outside on my first spacewalk when my left eye went blind  and I didn't know why. Suddenly my left eye slammed shut in great pain and I couldn't figure out why my eye wasn't working. I was thinking  what do I do next  I thought  well maybe that's why we have two eyes  so I kept working. But unfortunately  without gravity  tears don't fall. So you just get a bigger and  bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually  the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it  across the bridge of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes  goosh  into your other eye  and now I was completely blind outside the spaceship. So what's the scariest thing you've ever done  Maybe it's spiders. A lot of people are afraid of spiders. I think you should be afraid of spiders    spiders are creepy and they've got long  hairy legs  and spiders like this one  the brown recluse    it's horrible. If a brown recluse bites you  you end with one of these  horrible  big necrotic things on your leg and there might be one right now sitting on the chair behind you  in fact. And how do you know  And so a spider lands on you  and you go through this great  spasmy attack because spiders are scary. But then you could say  well  is there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not  I don't know. Are there brown recluses here  So if you actually do the research  you find out that in the world there are about         different types of spiders  and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of       . And if you're in Canada  because of the cold winters here in B.C.  there's about           different types of spiders and there's one    one    that is venomous  and its venom isn't even fatal  it's just kind of like a nasty sting. And that spider    not only that  but that spider has beautiful markings on it  it's like  I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation  symbol on my back  it's the black widow.  So  if you're even slightly careful you can avoid running into the one spider    and it lives close the ground  you're walking along  you are  never going to go through a spider web where a black widow bites you. Spider webs like this  it doesn't build those  it builds them down in the corners. And its a black widow because the female spider eats the male  it doesn't care about you. So in fact  the next time you walk into a spiderweb  you don't need to panic and go  with your caveman reaction. The danger is entirely different than the fear. How do you get around it  though  How do you change your behavior  Well  next time you see a spiderweb  have a good look  make sure  it's not a black widow spider  and then walk into it. And then you see another spiderweb and walk into that one. It's just a little bit of fluffy stuff. It's not a big deal. And the spider that may come out is  no more threat to you than a lady bug or a butterfly. And then I guarantee you if you  walk through     spiderwebs you will have changed your fundamental human behavior  your caveman reaction  and you will now be able to walk  in the park in the morning and not worry about that spiderweb    or into your grandma's attic or whatever  into your own basement. And you can apply this to anything. If you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded  your natural reaction would be to panic  I think. It would make you nervous and worried. But we had considered all the venom  and we had practiced with a whole  variety of different spiderwebs. We knew everything there is to know about the spacesuit and we trained underwater thousands of times. And we don't just practice things going right  we practice things going wrong all the time  so that you are constantly walking  through those spiderwebs. And not just underwater  but  also in virtual reality labs with the helmet and the gloves so you feel like it's realistic. So when you finally actually  get outside on a spacewalk  it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time. And even if you're blinded  your natural  panicky reaction doesn't happen. Instead you kind of look around and go   Okay  I can't see  but I can hear  I can talk  Scott Parazynski is out here with me. He could come over and help me.  We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue  so he could float me like a blimp and stuff me into the airlock if he had to. I could find my own way back. It's not nearly as big a deal. And actually  if you keep on crying for a while  whatever that gunk was that's  in your eye starts to dilute and you can start to see again  and Houston  if you negotiate with them  they will let you then keep working. We finished everything on the spacewalk and when we came back inside  Jeff got some cotton batting and took  the crusty stuff around my eyes  and it turned out it was just the anti fog  sort of a mixture of oil and soap  that got in my eye. And now we use Johnson's No More Tears  which we probably should've been using right from the very beginning.  Laughter  But the key to that is by looking at the difference between perceived danger and actual danger  where is the real risk  What is the real thing that you should be afraid of  Not just a generic fear of bad things happening. You can fundamentally change  your reaction to things so that it allows you to go places and see things and do things that otherwise would be completely denied to you ... where you could see the  hardpan south of the Sahara  or you can see New York City in a way that is almost dreamlike  or the unconscious gingham  of Eastern Europe fields or the Great Lakes as a collection of small puddles. You can see the fault lines of San Francisco and the way the water pours out under the bridge  just entirely different than any other way that you could have if you had not found a way to conquer your fear. You see a beauty that otherwise never would have happened. It's time to come home at the end. This is our spaceship  the Soyuz  that little one. Three of us climb in  and then this spaceship detaches from the station and falls into the atmosphere. These two parts here actually melt  we jettison them and they burn up in the atmosphere. The only part that survives is the little bullet that we're riding in  and it falls into the atmosphere  and in essence you are riding a meteorite home  and riding meteorites is scary  and it ought to be. But instead of riding into the atmosphere just screaming  like you would if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite back to Earth     Laughter     instead     years previously we had started studying Russian  and then once you learn Russian  then we learned orbital mechanics in Russian  and then we learned vehicle control theory  and then we got into the simulator and practiced over and over and over again. And in fact  you can fly this meteorite and steer it and land in about a    kilometer circle anywhere on the Earth. So in fact  when our crew was coming back into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz  we weren't screaming  we were laughing  it was fun. And when the great big parachute opened  we knew that if it didn't open there's a second parachute  and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism. So we came back  we came thundering back to Earth and this is what it looked like to land in a Soyuz  in Kazakhstan. search and recovery helicopters  once again that helicopter part of dozen such Russian Mi   helicopters. Touchdown         and    seconds  a.m. Central Time. CH  And you roll to a stop as if someone threw your  spaceship at the ground and it tumbles end over end  but you're ready for it you're in a custom built seat  you know how the shock absorber works. And then eventually the Russians reach in  drag you out  plunk you into a chair  and you can now look back at what was an incredible experience. You have taken the dreams of that nine year old boy  which were impossible and dauntingly scary  dauntingly terrifying  and put them into practice  and figured out a way to reprogram yourself  to change your primal fear so that it allowed you to come back with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration for other people that never could have been possible otherwise. Just to finish  they asked me to play that guitar. I know this song  and it's really a tribute to the genius of David Bowie himself  but it's also  I think  a reflection of the fact that we are not machines exploring the universe  we are people  and we're taking that ability to adapt and that ability to understand and the ability to take our own self perception into a new place.   This is Major Tom to ground control     I've left forevermore     And I'm floating in a most peculiar way     And the stars look very different today     For here am I floating in the tin can     A last glimpse of the world     Planet Earth is blue and  there's so much left to do   Fear not. That's very nice of you. Thank you very much. Thank you. I've come here today to talk to you about a problem. It's a very simple yet devastating problem  one that spans the globe and is affecting all of us. The problem is anonymous companies. It sounds like a really dry and technical thing  doesn't it  But anonymous companies are making it difficult and sometimes impossible to find out the actual human beings responsible sometimes for really terrible crimes. So  why am I here talking to all of you  Well  I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker and when my parents taught my twin brother and I to question authority  I don't think they knew where it might lead. And  they probably really regretted it during my stroppy teenage years when  predictably  I questioned their authority a lot. And a lot of my school teachers didn't appreciate it much either. You see  since the age of about five I've always asked the question  but why  But why does the Earth go around the sun  But why is blood red  But why do I have to go to school  But why do I have to respect the teachers and authority  And little did I realize that this question would become the basis of everything I would do. And so it was in my twenties  a long time ago  that one rainy Sunday afternoon in North London I was sitting with Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley and we were busy stuffing envelopes for a mail out in the office of the campaign group where we worked at the time. And as usual  we were talking  about the world's problems. And in particular  we were talking about the civil war in Cambodia. And we had talked about that  many  many times before. But then suddenly we stopped and looked at each other and said  but why don't we try and change this  And from that slightly crazy question  over two decades and many campaigns later  including alerting the world to the problem of blood diamonds funding war  from that crazy question  Global Witness is now an    strong team of campaigners  investigators   journalists and lawyers. And we're all driven by the same belief  that change really is possible. So  what exactly does Global Witness do  We investigate  we report  to uncover the people really responsible for funding conflict    for stealing millions from citizens around the world  also known as state looting  and for destroying the environment. And then we campaign hard to  change the system itself. And we're doing this because  so many of the countries rich in natural resources like oil or diamonds or timber are home to some of the poorest and most dispossessed people on the planet. And much of this injustice is made possible by currently accepted business practices. And one of these is anonymous companies. Now we've come up against anonymous companies in lots of our investigations  like in the Democratic Republic of Congo  where we exposed how secretive deals involving anonymous companies had deprived the citizens of one of the poorest countries on the planet of well over a billion dollars. That's twice the country's health  and education budget combined. Or in Liberia  where an international predatory logging company used front companies as it attempted to grab a really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests. Or political corruption in Sarawak  Malaysia  which has led to the destruction  of much of its forests. Well  that uses anonymous companies too. We secretly filmed some of the family of the former chief minister and a lawyer as they told our undercover investigator exactly how these dubious deals are done using such companies. And the awful thing is  there are so many other examples out there from all walks of life. This truly is a scandal of epic proportions hidden in plain sight. Whether it's the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel  the Zetas  who use anonymous companies  to launder profits while their drugs related violence is tearing communities apart across the Americas. Or the anonymous company  which bought up Americans' tax debts  piled on the legal fees and then gave homeowners a choice  Pay up or lose your home. Imagine being threatened with losing your home sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars  and not being able to find out who you were really up against. Now anonymous companies are great for sanctions busting too. As the Iranian government found out when  through a series of front companies  it owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan  on Fifth Avenue  despite American sanctions. And Juicy Couture  home of of the velvet track suit  and other companies were the unwitting  unknowing tenants there. There are just so many examples  the horesemeat scandal in Europe  the Italian mafia  they've used these companies for decades. The      million American Medicare fraud  the supply of weapons to wars around the world including those in Eastern Europe in the early '  s. Anonymous companies have even come to light in the recent revolution in the Ukraine. But  for every case that we and others expose there are so many more that will remain hidden away because of the current system. And it's just a simple truth that some of the people responsible  for outrageous crimes  for stealing from you and me and millions of others  they are remaining faceless and they are escaping accountability and they're doing this with ease  and they're doing it using legal structures. And really  that is unfair. Well  you might well ask  what exactly is an anonymous company  and can I really set one up  and use it  without anyone knowing who I am  Well  the answer is  yes you can. But if you're anything like me  you'll want to see some of that for yourself  so let me show you. Well first you need to work out where you want to set it up. Now  at this point you might be imagining one of those lovely tropical island tax havens but here's the thing  shockingly  my own hometown  London  and indeed the U.K.  is one of the best places in the world to set up an anonymous company. And the other  even better  I'm afraid that's America. Do you know  in some states across America you need less identification to open up a company than you do to get a library card  like Delaware  which is one of the easiest places in the world to set up an anonymous company. Okay  so let's say it's America  and let's say it's Delaware  and now you can simply go online and find yourself a company service provider. These are the companies that  can set your one up for you  and remember  it's all legal  routine business practice. So  here's one  but there are plenty of others to choose from. And having made your choice  you then pick what type of company you want and then fill in a contact  name and address. But don't worry  it doesn't have to be your name. It can be your lawyer's or your service provider's  and it's not for the public record anyway. And then you add the owner of the company. Now this is the key part  and again it doesn't have to be you  because you can get creative  because there is a whole universe  out there of nominees to choose from. And nominees are the people that you can legally pay to be your company's owner. And if you don't want to involve anyone else  it doesn't even have to be an actual human being. It could be another company. And then finally  give your company a name add a few more details and make your payment. And then the service provider will take a few hours or more to process it. But there you are  in    minutes of online shopping you can create yourself an anonymous company. And not only is it easy  really  really easy and cheap  it's totally legal too. But the fun doesn't have to end there  maybe you want to be even more anonymous. Well  that's no problem either. You can simply keep adding layers  companies owned by companies. You can have hundreds of layers with hundreds of companies spread across lots of different countries  like a giant web  each layer adds anonymity. Each layer makes it more difficult for law enforcement and others to find out who the real owner is. But whose interests is this all serving  It might be in the interests of the company or a particular individual  but what about all of us  the public  There hasn't even been a global conversation yet about whether it's okay to misuse companies in this way. And what does it all mean for us  Well  an example that really haunts me is one I came across recently. And it's that of a horrific fire in a nightclub in Buenos Aires about a decade ago. It was the night before New Year's Eve. Three thousand very happy revelers  many of them teenagers  were crammed into a space meant for      . And then tragedy struck  a fire broke out plastic decorations were melting from the ceiling and toxic smoke filled the club. So people tried to escape only to find that some of the fire doors had been chained shut. Over     people died. Seven hundred were injured trying to get out. And as the victims' families  and the city and the country reeled in shock  investigators tried to find out who was responsible. And as they looked for the owners of the club  they found instead anonymous companies  and confusion surrounded the identities of those involved with the companies. Now ultimately  a range of people were charged and some went to jail. But this was an awful tragedy  and it shouldn't have been so difficult just to try and find out who was responsible for those deaths. Because in an age when there is so much information out there in the open  why should this crucial information about company ownership stay hidden away  Why should tax evaders  corrupt  government officials  arms traders and more  be able to hide their identities from us  the public  Why should this secrecy be such  an accepted business practice  Anonymous companies might be the norm right now but it wasn't always this way. Companies were created to give people a chance to innovate and not have to put everything on the line. Companies were created to limit financial risk  they were never intended to  be used as a moral shield. Companies were never intended to be anonymous  and they don't have to be. And so I come to my wish. My wish is for us to know who owns and controls companies so that they can no longer be used anonymously against the public good. Together let's ignite world opinion  change the law  and launch a new era of openness in business. So what might this look like  Well  imagine if you could go online and look up the real owner of a company. Imagine if this data were open and free  accessible across borders for citizens and businesses and law enforcement alike. Imagine what a game changer that would be. So how are we going to do this  Well  there is only one way. Together  we have to change the law globally to create public registries which list the true owners of companies and can be accessed by all with no loopholes. And yes  this is ambitious  but there is momentum on this issue  and over the years I have seen the sheer power of momentum  and it's just starting on this issue. There is such an opportunity right now. And the TED community of creative and innovative thinkers and doers across all of society could make the crucial difference. You really can make this change happen. Now  a simple starting point is the address behind me for a Facebook page that you can join now to support the campaign and spread the word. It's going to be a springboard for our global campaigning. And the techies among you  you could really help us create a prototype public registry to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be. Campaign groups from around the world have come together to work on this issue. The U.K. government is already on board  it supports these public registries. And just last week  the European Parliament came on board with a vote     to    in favor of public registries. That is momentum. But it's early days. America still needs to come on board  as do so many other countries. And to succeed we will all together need to help and push our politicians  because without that  real far reaching  world shifting change just isn't going to happen. Because this isn't just about changing the law  this is about starting a conversation about what it's okay for companies to do  and in what ways is it acceptable  to use company structures. This isn't just a dry policy issue. This is a human issue which affects us all. This is about being on the right side of history. Global citizens  innovators   business leaders  individuals  we need you. Together  let's kickstart this global movement. Let's just do it  let's end anonymous companies. Thank you. Chris Anderson  We had Edward Snowden here a couple days ago  and this is response time. And several of you have written to me with questions to ask our guest here from the NSA. So Richard Ledgett is the   th deputy director of the National Security Agency  and he's a senior civilian officer there  acts as its chief operating officer  guiding strategies  setting internal policies  and serving as the principal advisor to the director. And all being well  welcome  Rick Ledgett  to TED. Richard Ledgett  I'm really thankful for the opportunity to talk to folks here. I look forward to the conversation  so thanks for arranging for that. CA  Thank you  Rick. We appreciate you joining us. It's certainly quite a strong statement that the NSA is willing to reach out and show a more open face here. You saw  I think  the talk and interview that Edward Snowden gave here a couple days ago. What did you make of it  RL  So I think it was interesting. We didn't realize that he  was going to show up there  so kudos to you guys for arranging a nice surprise like that. I think that  like a lot of the things that have come out since Mr. Snowden started disclosing classified information  there were some kernels of truth in there  but a lot of extrapolations and half truths in there  and I'm interested in helping to address those. I think this is a really important conversation that we're having in the United States and internationally  and I think it is important and of import  and so given that  we need to have that be a fact based conversation  and we want to help make that happen. CA  So the question that a lot  of people have here is  what do you make of Snowden's motivations for doing what he did  and did he have an alternative way that he could have gone  RL  He absolutely did have alternative ways that he could have gone  and I actually think that characterizing him as a whistleblower actually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities. So what if somebody who works in the NSA    and there are over        people who do. They're all great citizens. They're just like your husbands  fathers  sisters  brothers  neighbors  nephews  friends and relatives  all of whom are interested in doing the right thing for their country and for our allies internationally  and so there are a variety of venues to address if folks have a concern. First off  there's their supervisor  and up through the supervisory chain within their organization. If folks aren't comfortable with that  there are a number of inspectors general. In the case of Mr. Snowden  he had the option of the NSA inspector general  the Navy inspector general  the Pacific Command inspector general  the Department of Defense inspector general  and the intelligence community inspector general  any of whom would have both kept his concerns in classified channels and been happy to address them. He had the option to go to congressional committees  and there are mechanisms to do that that are in place  and so he didn't do any of those things. CA  Now  you had said that Ed Snowden had other avenues for raising his concerns. The comeback on that is a couple of things  one  that he certainly believes that as a contractor  the avenues that would have been available to him as an employee weren't available  two  there's a track record of other whistleblowers  like  Thomas Andrews Drake  being treated pretty harshly  by some views  and thirdly  what he was taking on was not one specific flaw that he'd discovered  but programs that had been approved by all three branches of government. I mean  in that circumstance  couldn't you argue that what he did was reasonable  RL  No  I don't agree with that. I think that the   sorry  I'm getting feedback through the microphone there   the actions that he took were inappropriate because of the fact that  he put people's lives at risk  basically  in the long run  and I know there's been a lot of talk in public by Mr. Snowden and some of the journalists that say that the things that have been disclosed have not put national security and people at risk  and that is categorically not true. They actually do. I think there's also an amazing arrogance to the idea that he knows better than the framers of the Constitution in how the government should  be designed and work for separation of powers and the fact that the executive  and the legislative branch have to work together and they have checks and balances on each other  and then the judicial branch  which oversees the entire process. I think that's extremely arrogant on his part. CA  Can you give a specific example of how he put people's lives at risk  RL  Yeah  sure. So the things that he's disclosed  the capabilities  and the NSA is a capabilities based organization  so when we have foreign intelligence targets  legitimate things of interest    like  terrorists is the iconic example  but it includes things like human traffickers  drug traffickers  people who are trying to build advanced weaponry  nuclear weapons  and build delivery systems for those  and nation states who might be executing aggression against their immediate neighbors  which you may have some visibility into some of that that's going on right now  the capabilities are applied in very discrete and measured and controlled ways. So the unconstrained disclosure  of those capabilities means that as adversaries see them and recognize   Hey  I might be vulnerable to this   they move away from that  and we have seen targets in terrorism  in the nation state area  in smugglers of various types  and other folks who have  because of the disclosures  moved away from our ability to have insight into what they're doing. The net effect of that is that our people who are overseas in dangerous places  whether they're diplomats or military  and our allies who are in similar situations  are at greater risk because we don't see the threats that are coming their way. CA  So that's a general response saying that because of his revelations  access that you had to certain types of information has been shut down  has been closed down. But the concern is that the nature of that access was not necessarily legitimate in the first place. I mean  describe to us this Bullrun program where it's alleged that the NSA specifically weakened security in order to get the type of  access that you've spoken of. RL  So there are  when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that I described before  use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology  and they do  because it's a great system  it's the most complex system ever devised by man  and it is a wonder  and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that  and it's just a wonderful thing. But it's also used by people who are working against us and our allies. And so if I'm going to pursue them  I need to have the capability to go after them  and again  the controls are in how I apply that capability  not that I have the capability itself. Otherwise  if we could make it so that all the bad guys used one corner of the Internet  we could have a domain  badguy.com. That would be awesome  and we could just concentrate all our efforts there. That's not how it works. They're trying to hide from the government's ability to isolate and interdict their actions  and so we have to swim in that same space. But I will tell you this. So NSA has two missions. One is the Signals Intelligence mission that we've unfortunately read so much about in the press. The other one is the Information Assurance mission  which is to protect the national security systems of the United States  and by that  that's things like the communications that the president uses  the communications that control our nuclear weapons  the communications that our military uses around the world  and the communications that we use with our allies  and that some of our allies themselves use. And so we make recommendations on standards to use  and we use those same standards  and so we are invested in making sure that those communications are secure for their intended purposes. CA  But it sounds like what you're saying is that when it comes to the Internet at large  any strategy is fair game if it improves America's safety. And I think this is partly where there is such a divide of opinion  that there's a lot of people in this room and around the world who think very differently about the Internet. They think of it as a momentous invention of humanity  kind of on a par with the Gutenberg press  for example. It's the bringer of knowledge to all. It's the connector of all. And it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms. And from that lens  what the NSA has done is equivalent to the authorities back in Germany inserting some device into every printing press that would reveal which books people bought and what they read. Can you understand that from that viewpoint  it feels outrageous  RL  I do understand that  and I actually share the view of the utility of the Internet  and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet. It is a global telecommunications system. The Internet is a big chunk of  that  but there is a lot more. And I think that people have legitimate concerns about the balance between transparency and secrecy. That's sort of been couched as a balance between privacy and national security. I don't think that's the right framing. I think it really is transparency and secrecy. And so that's the national and international conversation that we're having  and we want to participate in that  and want people to participate in it in an informed way. So there are things  let me talk there a little bit more  there are things that we need to be transparent about  our authorities  our processes  our oversight  who we are. We  NSA  have not done a good job of that  and I think that's part of the reason that this has been so revelational and so sensational in the media. Nobody knew who we were. We were the No Such Agency  the Never Say Anything. There's takeoffs of our logo of an eagle with headphones on around it. And so that's the public characterization. And so we need to be more transparent about those things. What we don't need to be transparent about  because it's bad for the U.S.  it's bad for all those other countries that we work with and that we help provide information that helps them secure themselves and their people  it's bad to expose operations and capabilities in a way that allows the people that we're all working against  the generally recognized bad guys  to counter those. CA  But isn't it also bad to deal a kind of body blow to the American companies that have essentially given the world most of the Internet services that matter  RL  It is. It's really the companies are in a tough position  as are we  because the companies  we compel them to provide information  just like every other nation in the world does. Every industrialized nation in the world has a lawful intercept program where they are requiring companies to provide them with information that they need for their security  and the companies that are involved have complied with those programs in the same way that they have to do when they're operating in Russia or the U.K. or China or India or France  any country that you choose to name. And so the fact that these revelations have been broadly characterized as  you can't trust company A because your privacy is suspect with them  is actually only accurate in the sense that it's accurate with every other company in the world that deals with any of those countries in the world. And so it's being picked up by people as a marketing advantage  and it's being marketed that  way by several countries  including some of our allied countries  where they are saying   Hey  you can't trust the U.S.  but you can trust our telecom company  because we're safe.  And they're actually using that to counter the very large technological edge that U.S. companies have in areas like the cloud and Internet based technologies. CA  You're sitting there with the American flag  and the American Constitution guarantees freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. How do you characterize the American citizen's right to privacy  Is there such a right  RL  Yeah  of course there is. And we devote an inordinate amount of time and pressure  inordinate and appropriate  actually I should say  amount of time and effort in order to ensure that we protect that privacy. and beyond that  the privacy of citizens around the world  it's not just Americans. Several things come into play here. First  we're all in the same network. My communications  I'm a user of a particular Internet email service that is the number one email service of choice by terrorists around the world  number one. So I'm there right beside them in email space in the Internet. And so we need to be able to pick that apart and find the information that's relevant. In doing so  we're going to necessarily encounter Americans and innocent foreign citizens who are just going about their business  and so we have procedures in place that shreds that out  that says  when you find that  not if you find it  when you find it  because you're certain to find it  here's how you protect that. These are called minimization procedures. They're approved by the attorney general and constitutionally based. And so we protect those. And then  for people  citizens of the world who are going about their lawful business on a day to day basis  the president on his January    speech  laid out some additional protections that we are providing to them. So I think absolutely  folks do have a right to privacy  and that we work very hard to make sure that that right to privacy is protected. CA  What about foreigners using American companies' Internet services  Do they have any privacy rights  RL  They do. They do  in the sense of  the only way that we are able to compel one of those companies to provide us information is when it falls into one of three categories  We can identify that this particular person  identified by a selector of some kind  is associated with counterterrorist or proliferation or other foreign intelligence target. CA  Much has been made of the fact that a lot of the information that you've obtained through these programs is essentially metadata. It's not necessarily the actual words that someone has written in an email or given on a phone call. It's who they wrote to and when  and so forth. But it's been argued  and someone here in the audience has talked to a former NSA analyst who said metadata is actually much more invasive than the core data  because in the core data you present yourself as you want to be presented. With metadata  who knows what the conclusions are that are drawn  Is there anything to that  RL  I don't really understand that argument. I think that metadata's important for a couple of reasons. Metadata is the information that lets you find connections that people are trying to hide. So when a terrorist is corresponding with somebody else who's not known to us but is engaged in doing or supporting terrorist activity  or someone who's violating international sanctions by providing nuclear weapons related material to a country like Iran or North Korea  is trying to hide that activity because it's illicit activity. What metadata lets you do is connect that. The alternative to that is one that's much less efficient and much more invasive of privacy  which is gigantic amounts of content collection. So metadata  in that sense  actually is privacy enhancing. And we don't  contrary to some of the stuff that's been printed  we don't sit there and grind out metadata profiles of average people. If you're not connected to one of those valid intelligence targets  you are not of interest to us. CA  So in terms of the threats that face America overall  where would you place terrorism  RL  I think terrorism is still number one. I think that we have never been in a time where there are more places where things are going badly and forming the petri dish in which terrorists take advantage of the lack of governance. An old boss of mine  Tom Fargo  Admiral Fargo  used to describe it as arcs of instability. And so you have a lot of those arcs of instability in the world right now  in places like Syria  where there's a civil war going on and you have massive numbers  thousands and thousands of foreign fighters who are coming into Syria to learn how to be terrorists and practice that activity  and lots of those people are Westerners who hold passports to European countries or in some cases the United States  and so they are basically learning how to do jihad and have expressed intent to go out and do that later on in their home countries. You've got places like Iraq  which is suffering from a high level of sectarian violence  again a breeding ground for terrorism. And you have the activity in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel area of Africa. Again  lots of weak governance which forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity. So I think it's very serious. I think it's number one. I think number two is cyber threat. I think cyber is a threat in three ways  One way  and probably the most common way that people have heard about it  is due to the theft of intellectual property  so basically  foreign countries going in  stealing companies' secrets  and then providing that information to state owned enterprises or companies connected to the government to help them leapfrog technology or to gain business intelligence that's then used to win contracts overseas. That is a hugely costly set of activities that's going on right now. Several nation states are doing it. Second is the denial of service attacks. You're probably aware that there have been a spate of those directed against the U.S. financial sector since     . Again  that's a nation state who is executing those attacks  and they're doing that as a semi anonymous way of reprisal. And the last one is destructive attacks  and those are the ones that concern me the most. Those are on the rise. You have the attack against Saudi Aramco in       August of     . It took down about        of their computers with a Wiper style virus. You had a follow on a week later to a Qatari company. You had March of       you had a South Korean attack that was attributed in the press to North Korea that took out thousands of computers. Those are on the rise  and we see people expressing interest in those capabilities and a desire to employ them. CA  Okay  so a couple of things here  because this is really the core of this  almost. I mean  first of all  a lot of people who look at risk and look at the numbers don't understand this belief that terrorism is still the number one threat. Apart from September     I think the numbers are that in the last    or    years about     Americans have died from terrorism  mostly from homegrown terrorists. The chance in the last few years of being killed by terrorism is far less than the chance of being killed by lightning. I guess you would say that a single nuclear incident or bioterrorism act or something like that would change those numbers. Would that be the point of view  RL  Well  I'd say two things. One is  the reason that there hasn't been a major attack in the United States since       that is not an accident. That's a lot of hard work that we have done  that other folks in the intelligence community have done  that the military has done  and that our allies around the globe have done. You've heard the numbers about the tip of the iceberg in terms of numbers of terrorist attacks that NSA programs contributed to stopping was        of those in Europe  and of those        of them occurred in three countries  some of which are our allies  and some of which are beating the heck out of us over the NSA programs  by the way. So that's not an accident that those things happen. That's hard work. That's us finding intelligence on terrorist activities and interdicting them through one way or another  through law enforcement  through cooperative activities with other countries and sometimes through military action. The other thing I would say is that your idea of nuclear or chem bio threat is not at all far fetched and in fact there are a number of groups who have for several years expressed interest and desire in obtaining those capabilities and work towards that. CA  It's also been said that  of those    alleged incidents  that as few as zero of them were actually anything to do with these controversial programs that Mr. Snowden revealed  that it was basically through other forms of intelligence  that you're looking for a needle in a haystack  and the effects of these programs  these controversial programs  is just to add hay to the stack  not to really find the needle. The needle was found by other methods. Isn't there something to that  RL  No  there's actually two programs that are typically implicated in that discussion. One is the section     program  the U.S. telephony metadata program  and the other one is popularly called the PRISM program  and it's actually section      of the FISA Amendment Act. But the     program is only relevant to threats that are directed against the United States  and there have been a dozen threats where that was implicated. Now what you'll see people say publicly is there is no  but for  case  and so there is no case where  but for that  the threat would have happened. But that actually indicates a lack of understanding of how terrorist investigations actually work. You think about on television  you watch a murder mystery. What do you start with  You start with a body  and then they work their way from there to solve the crime. We're actually starting well before that  hopefully before there are any bodies  and we're trying to build the case for who the people are  what they're trying to do  and that involves massive amounts of information. Think of it is as mosaic  and it's hard to say that any one piece of a mosaic was necessary to building the mosaic  but to build the complete picture  you need to have all the pieces of information. On the other  the non U.S. related threats out of those     the other    of them  the PRISM program was hugely relevant to that  and in fact was material in contributing to stopping those attacks. CA  Snowden said two days ago that terrorism has always been what is called in the intelligence world  a cover for action   that it's something that  because it invokes such a powerful emotional response in people  it allows the initiation of these programs to achieve powers that an organization like yours couldn't otherwise have. Is there any internal debate about that  RL  Yeah. I mean  we debate these things all the time  and there is discussion that goes on in the executive branch and within NSA itself and the intelligence community about what's right  what's proportionate  what's the correct thing to do. And it's important to note that the programs that we're talking about were all authorized by two different presidents  two different political parties  by Congress twice  and by federal judges    different times  and so this is not NSA running off and doing its own thing. This is a legitimate activity of the United States foreign government that was agreed to by all the branches of the United States government  and President Madison would have been proud. CA  And yet  when congressmen discovered what was actually being done  with that authorization  many of them were completely shocked. Or do you think that is not a legitimate reaction  that it's only because it's now come out publicly  that they really knew exactly what you were doing with the powers they had granted you  RL  Congress is a big body. There's     of them  and they change out frequently  in the case of the House  every two years  and I think that the NSA provided all the relevant information to our oversight committees  and then the dissemination of that information by the oversight committees throughout Congress is something that they manage. I think I would say that Congress members had the opportunity to make themselves aware  and in fact a significant number of them  the ones who are assigned oversight responsibility  did have the ability to do that. And you've actually had the chairs of those committees say that in public. CA  Now  you mentioned the  threat of cyberattacks  and I don't think anyone in this room would disagree that that is a huge concern  but do you accept that there's a tradeoff between offensive and defensive strategies  and that it's possible that the very measures taken to   weaken encryption   and allow yourself to find the bad guys  might also open the door to forms of cyberattack  RL  So I think two things. One is  you said weaken encryption. I didn't. And the other one is that the NSA has both of those missions  and we are heavily biased towards defense  and  actually  the vulnerabilities that we find in the overwhelming majority of cases  we disclose to the people who are responsible for manufacturing or developing those products. We have a great track record of that  and we're actually working on a proposal right now to be transparent and to publish transparency reports in the same way that the Internet companies are being allowed to publish transparency reports for them. We want to be more transparent about that. So again  we eat our own dog food. We use the standards  we use the products that we recommend  and so it's in our interest to keep our communications protected in the same way that other people's need to be. CA  Edward Snowden  when  after his talk  was wandering the halls here in the bot  and I heard him say to a couple of people  they asked him about what he thought of the NSA overall  and he was very complimentary about the people who work with you  said that it's a really impassioned group of employees who are seeking to do the right thing  and that the problems have come from just some badly conceived policies. He came over certainly very reasonably and calmly. He didn't come over like a crazy man. Would you accept that at least  even if you disagree with how he did it  that he has opened a debate that matters  RL  So I think that the discussion is an important one to have. I do not like the way that he did it. I think there were a number of other ways that he could have done that that would have not endangered our people and the people of other nations through losing visibility into what our adversaries are doing. But I do think it's an important conversation. CA  It's been reported that there's almost a difference of opinion with you and your colleagues over any scenario in which he might be offered an amnesty deal. I think your boss  General Keith Alexander  has said that that would be a terrible example for others  you can't negotiate with someone who's broken the law in that way. But you've been quoted as saying that  if Snowden could prove that he was surrendering all undisclosed documents  that a deal maybe should be considered. Do you still think that  RL  Yeah  so actually  this is my favorite thing about that     Minutes  interview was all the misquotes that came from that. What I actually said  in  response to a question about  would you entertain any discussions of mitigating action against Snowden  I said  yeah  it's worth a conversation. This is something that the attorney general of the United States and the president also actually have both talked about this  and I defer to the attorney general  because this is his lane. But there is a strong tradition in American jurisprudence of having discussions with people who have been charged with crimes in order to  if it benefits the government  to get something out of that  that there's always room for that kind of discussion. So I'm not presupposing any outcome  but there is always room for discussion. CA  To a lay person it seems like he has certain things to offer the U.S.  the government  you  others  in terms of putting things right and helping figure out a smarter policy  a smarter way forward for the future. Do you see  has that kind of possibility been entertained at all  RL  So that's out of my lane. That's not an NSA thing. That would be a Department of Justice sort of discussion. I'll defer to them. CA  Rick  when Ed Snowden ended his talk  I offered him the chance to share an idea worth spreading. What would be your idea worth spreading for this group  RL  So I think  learn the facts. This is a really important conversation  and it impacts  it's not just NSA  it's not just the government  it's you  it's the Internet companies. The issue of privacy and personal data is much bigger than just the government  and so learn the facts. Don't rely on headlines  don't rely on sound bites  don't rely on one sided conversations. So that's the idea  I think  worth spreading. We have a sign  a badge tab  we wear badges at work with lanyards  and if I could make a plug  my badge lanyard at work says   Dallas Cowboys.  Go Dallas. I've just alienated half the audience  I know. So the lanyard that our people who work in the organization that does our crypto analytic work have a tab that says   Look at the data.  So that's the idea worth spreading. Look at the data. CA  Rick  it took a certain amount of courage  I think  actually  to come and speak openly to this group. It's not something the NSA has done a lot of in the past  and plus the technology has been challenging. We truly appreciate you doing that and sharing in this very important conversation. Thank you so much. RL  Thanks  Chris. Charlie Rose  So Larry sent me an email and he basically said  we've got to make sure that  we don't seem like we're a couple of middle aged boring men. I said  I'm flattered by that    because I'm a bit older  and he has a bit more net worth than I do. Larry Page  Well  thank you. CR  So we'll have a conversation about the Internet  and we'll have a conversation Google  and we'll have a conversation about search and privacy  and also about your philosophy and a sense of how you've connected the dots and how this journey that began some time ago has such interesting prospects. Mainly we want to talk about the future. So my first question  Where is Google and where is it going  LP  Well  this is something we think about a lot  and our mission we defined a long time ago is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And people always say  is that really what you guys are still doing  And I always kind of think about that myself  and I'm not quite sure. But actually  when I think about search  it's such a deep thing for all of us  to really understand what you want  to understand the world's information  and we're still very much in the early stages of that  which is totally crazy. We've been at it for    years already  but it's not at all done. CR  When it's done  how will it be  LP  Well  I guess  in thinking about where we're going    you know  why is it not done     a lot of it is just computing's kind of a mess. You know  your computer doesn't know where you are  it doesn't know what you're doing  it doesn't know what you know  and a lot we've been trying to do recently is just make your devices work  make them understand your context. Google Now  you know  knows where you are  knows what you may need. So really having computing  work and understand you and understand that information  we really haven't done that yet. It's still very  very clunky. CR  Tell me  when you look at what Google is doing  where does Deep Mind fit  LP  Yeah  so Deep Mind is a company we just acquired recently. It's in the U.K. First  let me tell you the way we got there  which was looking at search and really understanding  trying to understand everything  and also make the computers not clunky and really understand you    like  voice was really important. So what's the state of the art  on speech recognition  It's not very good. It doesn't really understand you. So we started doing machine learning research to improve that. That helped a lot. And we started just looking at things like YouTube. Can we understand YouTube  But we actually ran machine learning on YouTube and it discovered cats  just by itself. Now  that's an important concept. And we realized there's really something here. If we can learn what cats are  that must be really important. So I think Deep Mind  what's really amazing about Deep Mind is that it can actually    they're learning things in this unsupervised way. They started with video games  and really just  maybe I can show the video  just playing video games  and learning how to do that automatically. CR  Take a look at the video games and how machines are coming to be able to do some remarkable things. LP  The amazing thing about this is this is  I mean  obviously  these are old games  but the system just sees what you see  the pixels  and it has the controls and it has the score  and it's learned to play all of these games  same program. It's learned to play all of these games with superhuman performance. We've not been able to do things like this with computers before. And maybe I'll just narrate this one quickly. This is boxing  and it figures out it can sort of pin the opponent down. The computer's on the left  and it's just racking up points. So imagine if this kind of intelligence were thrown at your schedule  or your information needs  or things like that. We're really just at the beginning of that  and that's what I'm really excited about. CR  When you look at all that's taken place with Deep Mind and the boxing  also a part of where we're going is artificial intelligence. Where are we  when you look at that  LP  Well  I think for me  this is kind of one of the most exciting things I've seen in a long time. The guy who started this company  Demis  has a neuroscience and a computer science background. He went back to school to get his Ph.D. to study the brain. And so I think we're seeing a lot of exciting work going on that sort of crosses computer science and neuroscience in terms of really understanding what it takes to make something smart and do really interesting things. CR  But where's the level of it now  And how fast do you think we are moving  LP  Well  this is the state of the art right now  understanding cats on YouTube and things like that  improving voice recognition. We used a lot of machine learning to improve things incrementally  but I think for me  this example's really exciting  because it's one program that can do a lot of different things. CR  I don't know if we can do this  but we've got the image of the cat. It would be wonderful to see this. This is how machines looked at cats and what they came up with. Can we see that image  LP  Yeah. CR  There it is. Can you see the cat  Designed by machines  seen by machines. LP  That's right. So this is learned from just watching YouTube. And there's no training  no notion of a cat  but this concept of a cat is something important that you would understand  and now that the machines can kind of understand. Maybe just finishing also on the search part  it started with search  really understanding people's context and their information. I did have a video I wanted to show quickly on that that we actually found. Zack Matere  Not long ago  I planted a crop of potatoes. Then suddenly they started dying one after the other. I checked out the books and  they didn't tell me much. So  I went and I did a search.   Zack Matere  Farmer   Potato diseases. One of the websites told me that ants could be the problem. It said  sprinkle wood ash over the plants. Then after a few days the ants disappeared. I got excited about the Internet. I have this friend who really would like to expand his business. So I went with him to the cyber cafe and we checked out several sites. When I met him next  he was going to put a windmill at the local school. I felt proud because something that wasn't there before was suddenly there. I realized that not everybody can be able to access what I was able to access. I thought that I need to have an Internet that my grandmother can use. So I thought about a notice board. A simple wooden notice board. When I get information on my phone  I'm able to post the information on the notice board. So it's basically like a computer. I use the Internet to help people. I think I am searching for a better life for me and my neighbors. So many people have access to information  but there's no follow up to that. I think the follow up to that is our knowledge. When people have the knowledge  they can find solutions without having to helped out. Information is powerful  but it is how we use it that will define us. LP  Now  the amazing thing about that video  actually  was we just read about it in the news  and we found this gentlemen  and made that little clip. CR  When I talk to people about you  they say to me  people who know you well  say  Larry wants to change the world  and he believes technology can show the way. And that means access to the Internet. It has to do with languages. It also means how people can get access and do things that will affect their community  and this is an example. LP  Yeah  that's right  and I think for me  I have been focusing on access more  if we're talking about the future. We recently released this Loon Project which is using balloons to do it. It sounds totally crazy. We can show the video here. Actually  two out of three people in the world don't have good Internet access now. We actually think this can really help people sort of cost efficiently. CR  It's a balloon. LP  Yeah  get access to the Internet. CR  And why does this balloon give you access to the Internet  Because there was some interesting things you had to do to figure out how to make balloons possible  they didn't have to be tethered. LP  Yeah  and this is a good example of innovation. Like  we've been thinking about this idea for five years or more before we started working on it  but it was just really  how do we get access points up high  cheaply  You normally have to use satellites and it takes a long time to launch them. But you saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon and get it up  and actually again  it's the power of the Internet  I did a search on it  and I found         years ago  someone had put up a balloon and it had gone around the Earth multiple times. And I thought  why can't we do that today  And that's how this project got going. CR  But are you at the mercy of the wind  LP  Yeah  but it turns out  we did some weather simulations which probably hadn't really been done before  and if you control the altitude of the balloons  which you can do by pumping air into them and other ways  you can actually control roughly where they go  and so I think we can build a worldwide mesh of these balloons that can cover the whole planet. CR  Before I talk about the future and transportation  where you've been a nerd for a while  and this fascination you have with transportation and automated cars and bicycles  let me talk a bit about what's been the subject here earlier with Edward Snowden. It is security and privacy. You have to have been thinking about that. LP  Yeah  absolutely. I saw the picture of Sergey with Edward Snowden yesterday. Some of you may have seen it. But I think  for me  I guess  privacy and security are a really important thing. We think about it in terms of both things  and I think you can't have privacy without security  so let me just talk about security first  because you asked about Snowden and all of that  and then I'll say a little bit about privacy. I think for me  it's tremendously disappointing that the government secretly did all this stuff and didn't tell us. I don't think we can have a democracy if we're having to protect you and our users from the government for stuff that we've never had a conversation about. And I don't mean we have to know what the particular terrorist attack is they're worried about protecting us from  but we do need to know what the parameters of it is  what kind of surveillance the government's going to do and how and why  and I think we haven't had that conversation. So I think the government's actually done itself a tremendous disservice by doing all that in secret. CR  Never coming to Google to ask for anything. LP  Not Google  but the public. I think we need to  have a debate about that  or we can't have a functioning democracy. It's just not possible. So I'm sad that Google's in the position of protecting you and our users from the government doing secret thing that nobody knows about. It doesn't make any sense. CR  Yeah. And then there's a privacy side of it. LP  Yes. The privacy side  I think it's    the world is changing. You carry a phone. It knows where you are. There's so much more information about you  and that's an important thing  and it makes sense why people are asking difficult questions. We spend a lot of time thinking about this and what the issues are. I'm a little bit    I think the main thing that we need to do is just provide people choice  show them what data's being collected    search history  location data. We're excited about incognito mode in Chrome  and doing that in more ways  just giving people more choice and more awareness of what's going on. I also think it's very easy. What I'm worried is that we throw out the baby with the bathwater. And I look at  on your show  actually  I kind of lost my voice  and I haven't gotten it back. I'm hoping that by talking to you I'm going to get it back. CR  If I could do anything  I would do that. LP  All right. So get out your voodoo doll and whatever you need to do. But I think  you know what  I look at that  I made that public  and I got all this information. We got a survey done on medical conditions with people who have similar issues  and I look at medical records  and I say  wouldn't it be amazing if everyone's medical records were available anonymously to research doctors  And when someone accesses your medical record  a research doctor  they could see  you could see which doctor accessed it and why  and you could maybe learn about what conditions you have. I think if we just did that  we'd save         lives this year. CR  Absolutely. Let me go    Applause  LP  So I guess I'm just very worried that with Internet privacy  we're doing the same thing we're  doing with medical records  is we're throwing out the baby with the bathwater  and we're not really thinking about the tremendous good that can come from people sharing information with the right people in the right ways. CR  And the necessary condition that people have to have confidence that their information will not be abused. LP  Yeah  and I had this problem with my voice stuff. I was scared to share it. Sergey encouraged me to do that  and it was a great thing to do. CR  And the response has been overwhelming. LP  Yeah  and people are super positive. We got thousands and thousands of people with similar conditions  which there's no data on today. So it was a really good thing. CR  So talking about the future  what is it about you and transportation systems  LP  Yeah. I guess I was just frustrated with this when I was at college in Michigan. I had to get on the bus and take it and wait for it. And it was cold and snowing. I did some research on how much it cost  and I just became a bit obsessed with transportation systems. CR  And that began the idea of an automated car. LP  Yeah  about    years ago I learned about people working on automated cars  and I became fascinated by that  and it takes a while to  get these projects going  but I'm super excited about the possibilities of that improving the world. There's    million people or more injured per year. It's the leading cause of death for people under    in the U.S. CR  So you're talking about saving lives. LP  Yeah  and also saving space and making life better. Los Angeles is half parking lots and roads  half of the area  and most cities are not far behind  actually. It's just crazy that that's what we use our space for. CR  And how soon will we be there  LP  I think we can be there very  very soon. We've driven well over         miles now totally automated. I'm super excited about getting that out quickly. CR  But it's not only you're talking about automated cars. You also have this idea for bicycles. LP  Well at Google  we got this idea that we should just provide free bikes to everyone  and that's been amazing  most of the trips. You see bikes going everywhere  and the bikes wear out. They're getting used    hours a day. CR  But you want to put them above the street  too. LP  Well I said  how do we get people using bikes more  CR  We may have a video here. LP  Yeah  let's show the video. I just got excited about this. So this is actually how you might separate bikes from cars with minimal cost. Anyway  it looks totally crazy  but I was actually thinking about our campus  working with the Zippies and stuff  and just trying to get a lot more bike usage  and I was thinking about  how do you cost effectively separate the bikes from traffic  And I went and searched  and this is what I found. And we're not actually working on this  that particular thing  but it gets your imagination going. CR  Let me close with this. Give me a sense of the philosophy  of your own mind. You have this idea of  Google X . You don't simply want to go in some small  measurable arena of progress. LP  Yeah  I think many of the things we just  talked about are like that  where they're really    I almost use the economic concept of additionality  which means that you're doing something that wouldn't happen unless  you were actually doing it. And I think the more you can do things like that  the bigger impact you have  and that's about doing things that people might not think are possible. And I've been amazed  the more I learn about technology  the more I realize I don't know  and that's because this technological horizon  the thing that you can see to do next  the more you learn about technology  the more you learn what's possible. You learn that the balloons are possible because there's some material that will work for them. CR  What's interesting about  you too  though  for me  is that  we have lots of people who are thinking about the future  and they are going and looking and they're coming back  but we never see the implementation. I think of somebody you knew and read about  Tesla. The principle of that for you is what  LP  Well  I think invention is not enough. If you invent something  Tesla invented electric power that we use  but he struggled to get it out to people. That had to be done by other people. It took a long time. And I think if we can actually combine both things  where we have an innovation and invention focus  plus the ability to really    a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people in a way that's positive for the world and to give people hope. You know  I'm amazed with the Loon Project just how excited people were about that  because it gave them hope for the two thirds of the world that doesn't have Internet right now that's any good. CR  Which is a second thing about corporations. You are one of those people who believe that corporations are an agent of change if they are run well. LP  Yeah. I'm really dismayed most people think companies are basically evil. They get a bad rap. And I think that's somewhat correct. Companies are doing the same incremental thing that they did    years ago or    years ago. That's not really what we need. We need  especially in technology  we need revolutionary change  not incremental change. CR  You once said  actually  as I think I've got this about right  that you might consider  rather than giving your money  if you were leaving it to some cause  just simply giving it to Elon Musk  because you had confidence that he would change the future  and that you would therefore   LP  Yeah  if you want to go Mars  he wants to go to Mars  to back up humanity  that's a worthy goal  but it's a company  and it's philanthropical. So I think we aim to do kind of similar things. And I think  you ask  we have a lot of employees at Google who have become pretty wealthy. People make a lot of money in technology. A lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy. You're working because you want to change the world. You want to make it better. Why isn't the company that you work for worthy not just of your time but your money as well  I mean  but we don't have a concept of that. That's not how we think about companies  and I think it's sad  because companies are most of our effort. They're where most of people's time is  where a lot of the money is  and so I think I'd like for us to help out more than we are. CR  When I close conversations with lots of people  I always ask this question  What state of mind  what quality of mind is it that has served you best  People like Rupert Murdoch have said curiosity  and other people in the media have said that. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have said focus. What quality of mind  as I leave this audience  has enabled you to think about the future and at the same time change the present  LP  You know  I think the most important thing    I looked at lots of companies and why I thought they don't succeed over time. We've had a more rapid turnover of companies. And I said  what did they fundamentally do wrong  What did those companies all do wrong  And usually it's just that they missed the future. And so I think  for me  I just try to focus on that and say  what is that future really going to be and how do we create it  and how do we cause our organization  to really focus on that and drive that at a really high rate  And so that's been curiosity  it's been looking at things people might not think about  working on things that no one else is working on  because that's where the additionality really is  and be willing to do that  to take that risk. Look at Android. I felt guilty about working on Android when it was starting. It was a little startup we bought. It wasn't really what we were really working on. And I felt guilty about spending time on that. That was stupid. That was the future  right  That was a good thing to be working on. CR  It is great to see you here. It's great to hear from you  and a pleasure to sit at this table with you. Thanks  Larry. LP  Thank you. CR  Larry Page. In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies  fathers are usually known by their sons  but I'm one of the few fathers who is known by his daughter  and I am proud of it. Malala started her campaign for education and stood for her rights in       and when her efforts were honored in       and she was given the national youth peace prize  and she became a very famous  very popular young girl of her country. Before that  she was my daughter  but now I am her father. Ladies and gentlemen  if we glance to human history  the story of women is the story of injustice  inequality  violence and exploitation. You see  in patriarchal societies  right from the very beginning  when a girl is born  her birth is not celebrated. She is not welcomed  neither by father nor by mother. The neighborhood comes and commiserates with the mother  and nobody congratulates the father. And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child. When she gives birth to the first girl child  first daughter  she is sad. When she gives birth to the second daughter  she is shocked  and in the expectation of a son  when she gives birth to a third daughter  she feels guilty like a criminal. Not only the mother suffers  but the daughter  the newly born daughter  when she grows old  she suffers too. At the age of five  while she should be going to school  she stays at home and her brothers are admitted in a school. Until the age of     somehow  she has a good life. She can have fun. She can play with her friends in the streets  and she can move around in the streets like a butterfly. But when she enters her teens  when she becomes    years old  she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort. She is confined under the four walls of her home. She is no more a free individual. She becomes the so called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family  and if she transgresses the code of that so called honor  she could even be killed. And it is also interesting that this so called code of honor  it does not only affect the life of a girl  it also affects the life of the male members of the family. I know a family of seven sisters and one brother  and that one brother  he has migrated to the Gulf countries  to earn a living for his seven sisters and parents  because he thinks that it will be humiliating if his seven sisters learn a skill and they go out of the home and earn some livelihood. So this brother  he sacrifices the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters at the altar of so called honor. And there is one more norm of the patriarchal societies that is called obedience. A good girl is supposed to be very quiet  very humble and very submissive. It is the criteria. The role model good girl should be very quiet. She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders  even if she does not like them. If she is married to a man she doesn't like or if she is married to an old man  she has to accept  because she does not want to be dubbed as disobedient. If she is married very early  she has to accept. Otherwise  she will be called disobedient. And what happens at the end  In the words of a poetess  she is wedded  bedded  and then she gives birth to more sons and daughters. And it is the irony of the situation that this mother  she teaches the same lesson of obedience to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to her sons. And this vicious cycle goes on  goes on. Ladies and gentlemen  this plight of millions of women could be changed if we think differently  if women and men think differently  if men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies in the developing countries  if they can break a few norms of family and society  if they can abolish the discriminatory laws of the systems in their states  which go against the basic human rights of the women. Dear brothers and sisters  when Malala was born  and for the first time  believe me  I don't like newborn children  to be honest  but when I went and I looked into her eyes  believe me  I got extremely honored. And long before she was born  I thought about her name  and I was fascinated with a heroic legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan. Her name was Malalai of Maiwand  and I named my daughter after her. A few days after Malala was born  my daughter was born  my cousin came    and it was a coincidence    he came to my home and he brought a family tree  a family tree of the Yousafzai family  and when I looked at the family tree  it traced back to     years of our ancestors. But when I looked  all were men  and I picked my pen  drew a line from my name  and wrote   Malala.  And when she grow old  when she was four and a half years old  I admitted her in my school. You will be asking  then  why should I mention about the admission of a girl in a school  Yes  I must mention it. It may be taken for granted in Canada  in America  in many developed countries  but in poor countries  in patriarchal societies  in tribal societies  it's a big event for the life of girl. Enrollment in a school means recognition of her identity and her name. Admission in a school means that she has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where she can explore her potentials for her future life. I have five sisters  and none of them could go to school  and you will be astonished  two weeks before  when I was filling out the Canadian visa form  and I was filling out the family part of the form  I could not recall the surnames of some of my sisters. And the reason was that I have never  never seen the names of my sisters written on any document. That was the reason that I valued my daughter. What my father could not give to my sisters and to his daughters  I thought I must change it. I used to appreciate the intelligence and the brilliance of my daughter. I encouraged her to sit with me when my friends used to come. I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings. And all these good values  I tried to inculcate in her personality. And this was not only she  only Malala. I imparted all these good values to my school  girl students  and boy students as well. I used education for emancipation. I taught my girls  I taught my girl students  to unlearn the lesson of obedience. I taught my boy students to unlearn the lesson of so called pseudo honor. Dear brothers and sisters  we were striving for more rights for women  and we were struggling to have more  more and more space for the women in society. But we came across a new phenomenon. It was lethal to human rights and particularly to women's rights. It was called Talibanization. It means a complete negation of women's participation in all political  economical and social activities. Hundreds of schools were lost. Girls were prohibited from going to school. Women were forced to wear veils and they were stopped from going to the markets. Musicians were silenced  girls were flogged and singers were killed. Millions were suffering  but few spoke  and it was the most scary thing when you have all around such people who kill and who flog  and you speak for your rights. It's really the most scary thing. At the age of     Malala stood  and she stood for the right of education. She wrote a diary for the BBC blog  she volunteered herself for the New York Times documentaries  and she spoke from every platform she could. And her voice was the most powerful voice. It spread like a crescendo all around the world. And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign  and on October         she was shot in the head at point blank range. It was a doomsday for my family and for me. The world turned into a big black hole. While my daughter was on the verge of life and death  I whispered into the ears of my wife   Should I be blamed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter   And she abruptly told me   Please don't blame yourself. You stood for the right cause. You put your life at stake for the cause of truth  for the cause of peace  and for the cause of education  and your daughter in inspired from you and she joined you. You both were on the right path and God will protect her.  These few words meant a lot to me  and I didn't ask this question again. When Malala was in the hospital  and she was going through the severe pains and she had had severe headaches because her facial nerve was cut down  I used to see a dark shadow spreading on the face of my wife. But my daughter never complained. She used to tell us   I'm fine with my crooked smile and with my numbness in my face. I'll be okay. Please don't worry.  She was a solace for us  and she consoled us. Dear brothers and sisters  we learned from her how to be resilient in the most difficult times  and I'm glad to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women  she is like any    year old girl. She cries when her homework is incomplete. She quarrels with her brothers  and I am very happy for that. People ask me  what special is in my mentorship which has made Malala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and poised  I tell them  don't ask me what I did. Ask me what I did not do. I did not clip her wings  and that's all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  Good morning. When I was a little boy  I had an experience that changed my life  and is in fact why I'm here today. That one moment profoundly affected how I think about art  design and engineering. As background  I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family of loving and talented artists in one of the world's great cities. My dad  John Ferren  who died when I was     was an artist by both passion and profession  as is my mom  Rae. He was one of the New York School abstract expressionists who  together with his contemporaries  invented American modern art  and contributed to moving the American zeitgeist towards modernism in the   th century. Isn't it remarkable that  after thousands of years of people doing mostly representational art  that modern art  comparatively speaking  is about    minutes old  yet now pervasive. As with many other important innovations  those radical ideas required no new technology  just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment  plus resiliency in the face of near universal criticism and rejection. In our home  art was everywhere. It was like oxygen  around us and necessary for life. As I watched him paint  Dad taught me that art was not about being decorative  but was a different way of communicating ideas  and in fact one that could bridge the worlds of knowledge and insight. Given this rich artistic environment  you'd assume that I would have been compelled to go into the family business  but no. I followed the path of most kids who are genetically programmed to make their parents crazy. I had no interest in becoming an artist  certainly not a painter. What I did love was electronics and machines    taking them apart  building new ones  and making them work. Fortunately  my family also had engineers in it  and with my parents  these were my first role models. What they all had in common was they worked very  very hard. My grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal kitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn. On weekends  we would go together to Cortlandt Street  which was New York City's radio row. There we would explore massive piles of surplus electronics  and for a few bucks bring home treasures like Norden bombsights and parts from the first IBM tube based computers. I found these objects both useful and fascinating. I learned about engineering and how things worked  not at school but by taking apart and studying these fabulously complex devices. I did this for hours every day  apparently avoiding electrocution. Life was good. However  every summer  sadly  the machines got left behind while my parents and I traveled overseas to experience history  art and design. We visited the great museums and historic buildings of both Europe and the Middle East  but to encourage my growing interest in science and technology  they would simply drop me off in places like the London Science Museum  where I would wander endlessly for hours by myself studying the history of science and technology. Then  when I was about nine years old  we went to Rome. On one particularly hot summer day  we visited a drum shaped building that from the outside was not particularly interesting. My dad said it was called the Pantheon  a temple for all of the gods. It didn't look all that special from the outside  as I said  but when we walked inside  I was immediately struck by three things  First of all  it was pleasantly cool despite the oppressive heat outside. It was very dark  the only source of light being an big open hole in the roof. Dad explained that this wasn't a big open hole  but it was called the oculus  an eye to the heavens. And there was something about this place  I didn't know why  that just felt special. As we walked to the center of the room  I looked up at the heavens through the oculus. This was the first church that I'd been to that provided an unrestricted view between God and man. But I wondered  what about when it rained  Dad may have called this an oculus  but it was  in fact  a big hole in the roof. I looked down and saw floor drains had been cut into the stone floor. As I became more accustomed to the dark  I was able to make out details of the floor and the surrounding walls. No big deal here  just the same statuary stuff that we'd seen all over Rome. In fact  it looked like the Appian Way marble salesman showed up with his sample book  showed it to Hadrian  and Hadrian said   We'll take all of it.  But the ceiling was amazing. It looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome. I'd seen these before  and Bucky was friends with my dad. It was modern  high tech  impressive  a huge     foot clear span which  not coincidentally  was exactly its height. I loved this place. It was really beautiful and unlike anything I'd ever seen before  so I asked my dad   When was this built   He said   About       years ago.  And I said   No  I mean  the roof.  You see  I assumed that this was a modern roof that had been put on because the original was destroyed in some long past war. He said   It's the original roof.  That moment changed my life  and I can remember it as if it were yesterday. For the first time  I realized people were smart       years ago.  Laughter  This had never crossed my mind. I mean  to me  the pyramids at Giza  we visited those the year before  and sure they're impressive  nice enough design  but look  give me an unlimited budget         to        laborers  and about    to    years to cut and drag stone blocks  across the countryside  and I'll build you pyramids too. But no amount of brute force gets you the dome of the Pantheon  not       years ago  nor today. And incidentally  it is still the largest unreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built. To build the Pantheon took some miracles. By miracles  I mean things that are technically barely possible  very high risk  and might not be actually accomplishable at this moment in time  certainly not by you. For example  here are some of the Pantheon's miracles. To make it even structurally possible  they had to invent super strong concrete  and to control weight  varied the density of the aggregate as they worked their way up the dome. For strength and lightness  the dome structure used five rings of coffers  each of diminishing size  which imparts a dramatic forced perspective to the design. It was wonderfully cool inside because of its huge thermal mass  natural convection of air rising up through the oculus  and a Venturi effect when wind blows across the top of the building. I discovered for the first time that light itself has substance. The shaft of light beaming through the oculus was both beautiful and palpable  and I realized for the first time that light could be designed. Further  that of all of the forms of design  visual design  they were all kind of irrelevant without it  because without light  you can't see any of them. I also realized that I wasn't the first person to think that this place was really special. It survived gravity  barbarians  looters  developers and the ravages of time to become what I believe is the longest continuously occupied building in history. Largely because of that visit  I came to understand that  contrary to what I was being told in school  the worlds of art and design were not  in fact  incompatible with science and engineering. I realized  when combined  you could create things that were amazing that couldn't be done in either domain alone. But in school  with few exceptions  they were treated as separate worlds  and they still are. My teachers told me that I had to get serious and focus on one or the other. However  urging me to specialize only caused me to really  appreciate those polymaths like Michelangelo  Leonardo da Vinci  Benjamin Franklin  people who did exactly the opposite. And this led me to embrace and want to be in both worlds. So then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity like the Pantheon actually happen  Someone themselves  perhaps Hadrian  needed a brilliant creative vision. They also needed the storytelling and leadership skills necessary to fund and execute it  and a mastery of science and technology with the ability and knowhow to push existing innovations even farther. It is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least five miracles. The problem is  no matter how talented  rich or smart you are  you only get one to one and a half miracles. That's it. That's the quota. Then you run out of time  money  enthusiasm  whatever. Remember  most people can't even imagine one of these technical miracles  and you need at least five to make a Pantheon. In my experience  these rare visionaries who can think across the worlds of art  design and engineering have the ability to notice when others have provided enough of the miracles to bring the goal within reach. Driven by the clarity of their vision  they summon the courage and determination to deliver the remaining miracles and they often take what other people think to be insurmountable obstacles and turn them into features. Take the oculus of the Pantheon. By insisting that it be in the design  it meant you couldn't use much of the structural technology that had been developed for Roman arches. However  by instead embracing it and rethinking weight and stress distribution  they came up with a design that only works if there's a big hole in the roof. That done  you now get the aesthetic and design benefits of light  cooling and that critical direct connection with the heavens. Not bad. These people not only believed that the impossible can be done  but that it must be done. Enough ancient history. What are some recent examples of innovations that combine creative design and technological advances in a way so profound that they will be remembered a thousand years from now  Well  putting a man on the moon was a good one  and returning him safely to Earth wasn't bad either. Talk about one giant leap  It's hard to imagine a more profound moment in human history than when we first left our world to set foot on another. So what came after the moon  One is tempted to say that today's pantheon is the Internet  but I actually think that's quite wrong  or at least it's only part of the story. The Internet isn't a Pantheon. It's more like the invention of concrete  important  absolutely necessary to build the Pantheon  and enduring  but entirely insufficient by itself. However  just as the technology of concrete was critical in realization of the Pantheon  new designers will use the technologies of the Internet to create novel concepts that will endure. The smartphone is a perfect example. Soon the majority of people on the planet will have one  and the idea of connecting everyone to both knowledge and each other will endure. So what's next  What imminent advance will be the equivalent of the Pantheon  Thinking about this  I rejected many very plausible and dramatic breakthroughs to come  such as curing cancer. Why  Because Pantheons are anchored in designed physical objects  ones that inspire by simply seeing and experiencing them  and will continue to do so indefinitely. It is a different kind of language  like art. These other vital contributions that extend life and relieve suffering are  of course  critical  and fantastic  but they're part of the continuum of our overall knowledge and technology  like the Internet. So what is next  Perhaps counterintuitively  I'm guessing it's a visionary idea from the late     s that's been revived every decade since  autonomous vehicles. Now you're thinking  give me a break. How can a fancy version of cruise control be profound  Look  much of our world has been designed around  roads and transportation. These were as essential to the success of the Roman Empire as the interstate highway system to the prosperity and development of the United States. Today  these roads that interconnect our world are dominated by cars and trucks that have remained largely unchanged for     years. Although perhaps not obvious today  autonomous vehicles will be the key technology that enables us to redesign our cities and  by extension  civilization. Here's why  Once they become ubiquitous  each year  these vehicles will save tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone and a million globally. Automotive energy consumption and air pollution will be cut dramatically. Much of the road congestion in and out of our cities will disappear. They will enable compelling new concepts in how we design cities  work  and the way we live. We will get where we're going faster and society will recapture vast amounts of lost productivity now spent sitting in traffic basically polluting. But why now  Why do we think this is ready  Because over the last    years  people from outside the automotive industry have spent countless billions creating the needed miracles  but for entirely different purposes. It took folks like DARPA  universities  and companies completely outside of the automotive industry to notice that if you were clever about it  autonomy could be done now. So what are the five miracles needed for autonomous vehicles  One  you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is. This was solved neatly by the GPS system  Global Positioning System  that the U.S. Government put in place. You need to know where all the roads are  what the rules are  and where you're going. The various needs of personal navigation systems  in car navigation systems  and web based maps address this. You must have near continuous communication with high performance computing networks and with others nearby to understand their intent. The wireless technologies developed for mobile devices  with some minor modifications  are completely suitable to solve this. You'll probably want some restricted roadways to get started that both society and its lawyers agree are safe to use for this. This will start with the HOV lanes and move from there. But finally  you need to recognize people  signs and objects. Machine vision  special sensors  and high performance computing can do a lot of this  but it turns out a lot is not good enough when your family is on board. Occasionally  humans will  need to do sense making. For this  you might actually have to wake up your passenger and ask them what the hell that big lump is in the middle of the road. Not so bad  and it will give us a sense of purpose in this new world. Besides  once the first drivers explain to their confused car that the giant chicken at the fork in the road is actually a restaurant  and it's okay to keep driving  every other car on the surface of the Earth will know that from that point on. Five miracles  mostly delivered  and now you just need a clear vision of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles with seductively beautiful  and new functional designs plus a lot of money and hard work to bring it home. The beginning is now only a handful of years away  and I predict that autonomous vehicles will permanently change our world over the next several decades. In conclusion  I've come to believe that the ingredients for the next Pantheons are all around us  just waiting for visionary people with the broad knowledge  multidisciplinary skills  and intense passion to harness them to make their dreams a reality. But these people don't spontaneously pop into existence. They need to be nurtured and encouraged from when they're little kids. We need to love them and help them discover their passions. We need to encourage them to work hard and help them understand that failure is a necessary ingredient for success  as is perseverance. We need to help them to find their own role models  and give them the confidence to believe in themselves and to believe that anything is possible  and just as my grandpa did when he took me shopping for surplus  and just as my parents did when they took me to science museums  we need to encourage them to find their own path  even if it's very different from our own. But a cautionary note  We also need to periodically pry them away from their modern miracles  the computers  phones  tablets  game machines and TVs  take them out into the sunlight so they can experience both the natural and design wonders of our world  our planet and our civilization. If we don't  they won't understand what these precious things are that someday they will be resopnsible for protecting and improving. We also need them to understand something that doesn't seem adequately appreciated in our increasingly tech dependent world  that art and design are not luxuries  nor somehow incompatible with science and engineering. They are in fact essential to what makes us special. Someday  if you get the chance  perhaps you can take your kids to the actual Pantheon  as we will our daughter Kira  to experience firsthand the power of that astonishing design  which on one otherwise unremarkable day in Rome  reached       years into the future to set the course for my life. Thank you. A herd of wildebeests  a shoal of fish  a flock of birds. Many animals gather in large groups that are among the most wonderful spectacles in the natural world. But why do these groups form  The common answers include things like seeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs or gathering to mate or breed  and all of these explanations  while often true  make a huge assumption about animal behavior  that the animals are in control of their own actions  that they are in charge of their bodies. And that is often not the case. This is Artemia  a brine shrimp. You probably know it better as a sea monkey. It's small  and it typically lives alone  but it can gather in these large red swarms that span for meters  and these form because of a parasite. These shrimp are infected with a tapeworm. A tapeworm is effectively a long  living gut with genitals at one end and a hooked mouth at the other. As a freelance journalist  I sympathize. The tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body  but it also does other things. It castrates them  it changes their color from transparent to bright red  it makes them live longer  and as biologist Nicolas Rode has found  it makes them swim in groups. Why  Because the tapeworm  like many other parasites  has a complicated life cycle involving many different hosts. The shrimp are just one step on its journey. Its ultimate destination is this  the greater flamingo. Only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce  so to get there  it manipulates its shrimp hosts into forming these conspicuous colored swarms that are easier for a flamingo to spot and to devour  and that is the secret of the Artemia swarm. They aren't sociable through their own volition  but because they are being controlled. It's not safety in numbers. It's actually the exact opposite. The tapeworm hijacks their brains and their bodies  turning them into vehicles for getting itself into a flamingo. And here is another example of a parasitic manipulation. This is a suicidal cricket. This cricket swallowed the  larvae of a Gordian worm  or horsehair worm. The worm grew to adult size within it  but it needs to get into water in order to mate  and it does that by releasing proteins that addle the cricket's brain  causing it to behave erratically. When the cricket nears a body of water  such as this swimming pool  it jumps in and drowns  and the worm wriggles out of its suicidal corpse. Crickets are really roomy. Who knew  The tapeworm and the Gordian worm are not alone. They are part of an entire cavalcade of mind controlling parasites  of fungi  viruses  and worms and insects and more that all specialize in subverting and overriding the wills of their hosts. Now  I first learned about this way of life through David Attenborough's  Trials of Life  about    years ago  and then later through a wonderful book called  Parasite Rex  by my friend Carl Zimmer. And I've been writing about these creatures ever since. Few topics in biology enthrall me more. It's like the parasites have subverted my own brain. Because after all  they are always compelling and they are delightfully macabre. When you write about parasites  your lexicon swells with phrases like  devoured alive  and  bursts out of its body.  But there's more to it than that. I'm a writer  and fellow writers in the audience will know that we love stories. Parasites invite us to resist the allure of obvious stories. Their world is one of plot twists and unexpected explanations. Why  for example  does this caterpillar start violently thrashing about when another insect gets close to it and those white cocoons that it seems to be standing guard over  Is it maybe protecting its siblings  No. This caterpillar was attacked by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it. The eggs hatched and the young wasps devoured the caterpillar alive before bursting out of its body. See what I mean  Now  the caterpillar didn't die. Some of the wasps seemed to stay behind and controlled it into defending their siblings which are metamorphosing into adults within those cocoons. This caterpillar is a head banging  zombie bodyguard defending the offspring of the creature that killed it. We have a lot to get through.  I only have    minutes.  Laughter  Now  some of you are probably just desperately clawing for some solace in the idea that these things are oddities of the natural world  that they are outliers  and that point of view is understandable  because by their nature  parasites are quite small and they spend a lot of their time inside the bodies of other things. They're easy to overlook  but that doesn't mean that they aren't important. A few years back  a man called Kevin Lafferty took a group of scientists into three Californian estuaries and they pretty much weighed and dissected and recorded everything they could find  and what they found were parasites in extreme abundance. Especially common were trematodes  tiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts like this unfortunate snail. Now  a single trematode is tiny  microscopic  but collectively they weighed as much as all the fish in the estuaries and three to nine times more than all the birds. And remember the Gordian worm that I showed you  the cricket thing  One Japanese scientist called Takuya Sato found that in one stream  these things drive so many crickets and grasshoppers into the water that the drowned insects make up some    percent of the diet of local trout. Manipulation is not an oddity. It is a critical and common part of the world around us  and scientists have now found hundreds of examples of such manipulators  and more excitingly  they're starting to understand exactly how these creatures control their hosts. And this is one of my favorite examples. This is Ampulex compressa  the emerald cockroach wasp  and it is a truth universally acknowledged that an emerald cockroach wasp in possession of some fertilized eggs must be in want of a cockroach. When she finds one  she stabs it with a stinger that is also a sense organ. This discovery came out three weeks ago. She stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ equipped with small sensory bumps that allow her to feel the distinctive texture of a roach's brain. So like a person blindly rooting about in a bag  she finds the brain  and she injects it with venom into two very specific clusters of neurons. Israeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal found that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon. It doesn't kill the roach  nor does it sedate it. The roach could walk away or fly or run if it chose to  but it doesn't choose to  because the venom nixes its motivation to walk  and only that. The wasp basically un checks the escape from danger box in the roach's operating system  allowing her to lead her helpless victim back to her lair by its antennae like a person walking a dog. And once there  she lays an egg on it  egg hatches  devoured alive  bursts out of body  yadda yadda yadda  you know the drill. Now I would argue that  once stung  the cockroach isn't a roach anymore. It's more of an extension of the wasp  just like the cricket was an extension of the Gordian worm. These hosts won't get to survive or reproduce. They have as much control over their own fates as my car. Once the parasites get in  the hosts don't get a say. Now humans  of course  are no stranger to manipulation. We take drugs to shift the chemistries of our brains and to change our moods  and what are arguments or advertising or big ideas if not an attempt to influence someone else's mind  But our attempts at doing this are crude and blundering compared to the fine grained specificity of the parasites. Don Draper only wishes he was as elegant and precise as the emerald cockroach wasp. Now  I think this is part of what makes parasites so sinister and so compelling. We place such a premium on our free will and our independence that the prospect of losing those qualities to forces unseen informs many of our deepest societal fears. Orwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals and mind controlling supervillains    these are tropes that fill our darkest fiction  but in nature  they happen all the time. Which leads me to an obvious and disquieting question  Are there dark  sinister parasites that are influencing our behavior without us knowing about it  besides the NSA  If there are any   I've got a red dot on my forehead now  don't I  If there are any  this is a good candidate for them. This is Toxoplasma gondii  or Toxo  for short  because the terrifying creature always deserves a cute nickname. Toxo infects mammals  a wide variety of mammals  but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat. And scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that if Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse  it turns the rodent into a cat seeking missile. If the infected rat smells the delightful odor of cat piss  it runs towards the source of the smell rather than the more sensible direction of away. The cat eats the rat. Toxo gets to have sex. It's a classic tale of Eat  Prey  Love. You're very charitable  generous people. Hi  Elizabeth  I loved your talk. How does the parasite control its host in this way  We don't really know. We know that Toxo releases an enzyme that makes dopamine  a substance involved in reward and motivation. We know it targets certain parts of a rodent's brain  including those involved in sexual arousal. But how those puzzle pieces fit together is not immediately clear. What is clear is that this thing is a single cell. This has no nervous system. It has no consciousness. It doesn't even have a body. But it's manipulating a mammal  We are mammals. We are more intelligent than a mere rat  to be sure  but our brains have the same basic structure  the same types of cells  the same chemicals running through them  and the same parasites. Estimates vary a lot  but some figures suggest that one in three people around the world have Toxo in their brains. Now typically  this doesn't lead to any overt illness. The parasite holds up in a dormant state for a long period of time. But there's some evidence that those people who are carriers score slightly differently on personality questionnaires than other people  that they have a slightly  higher risk of car accidents  and there's some evidence that people with schizophrenia are more likely to be infected. Now  I think this evidence is still inconclusive  and even among Toxo researchers  opinion is divided as to whether the parasite is truly influencing our behavior. But given the widespread nature of such manipulations  it would be completely implausible for humans to be the only species that weren't similarly affected. And I think that this capacity to constantly subvert our way of thinking about the world makes parasites amazing. They're constantly inviting us to look at the natural world sideways  and to ask if the behaviors we're seeing  whether they're simple and obvious or baffling and puzzling  are not the results of individuals acting through their own accord but because they are being bent to the control of something else. And while that idea may be disquieting  and while parasites' habits may be very grisly  I think that ability to surprise us makes them as wonderful and as charismatic as any panda or butterfly or dolphin. At the end of  On the Origin of Species   Charles Darwin writes about the grandeur of life  and of endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful  and I like to think he could easily have been talking about a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable or a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks. But perhaps  that's just a parasite talking. Thank you. My job at Twitter is to ensure user trust  protect user rights and keep users safe  both from each other and  at times  from themselves. Let's talk about what scale looks like at Twitter. Back in January       we saw more than two million new tweets each day on the platform. January       more than     million. We were seeing two million tweets in less than six minutes. That's a        percent increase. Now  the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way. There's no risk involved. My job is to root out and prevent activity that might. Sounds straightforward  right  You might even think it'd be easy  given that I just said the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way. Why spend so much time searching for potential calamities in innocuous activities  Given the scale that Twitter is at  a one in a million chance happens     times a day. It's the same for other companies dealing at this sort of scale. For us  edge cases  those rare situations that are unlikely to occur  are more like norms. Say   .    percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone. There's no threat involved. Maybe people are documenting travel landmarks like Australia's Heart Reef  or tweeting about a concert they're attending  or sharing pictures of cute baby animals. After you take out that   .    percent  that tiny percentage of tweets remaining works out to roughly         per month. The sheer scale of what we're dealing with makes for a challenge. You know what else makes my role particularly challenging  People do weird things. And I have to figure out what they're doing  why  and whether or not there's risk involved  often without much in terms of context or background. I'm going to show you some examples that I've run into during my time at Twitter    these are all real examples   of situations that at first seemed cut and dried  but the truth of the matter was something altogether different. The details have been changed to protect the innocent and sometimes the guilty. We'll start off easy.   Yo bitch   If you saw a Tweet that only said this  you might think to yourself   That looks like abuse.  After all  why would you want to receive the message   Yo  bitch.  Now  I try to stay relatively hip to the latest trends and memes  so I knew that  yo  bitch  was also often a common greeting between friends  as well as being a popular  Breaking Bad  reference. I will admit that I did not expect to encounter a fourth use case. It turns out it is also used on Twitter when people are role playing as dogs. And in fact  in that case  it's not only not abusive  it's technically just an accurate greeting. So okay  determining whether or not something is abusive without context  definitely hard. Let's look at spam. Here's an example of an account engaged in classic spammer behavior  sending the exact same message to thousands of people. While this is a mockup I put together using my account  we see accounts doing this all the time. Seems pretty straightforward. We should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior. Turns out there's some exceptions to that rule. Turns out that that message could also be a notification you signed up for that the International Space Station is passing overhead because you wanted to go outside and see if you could see it. You're not going to get that chance if we mistakenly suspend the account thinking it's spam. Okay. Let's make the stakes higher. Back to my account  again exhibiting classic behavior. This time it's sending the same message and link. This is often indicative of  something called phishing  somebody trying to steal another person's account information by directing them to another website. That's pretty clearly not a good thing. We want to  and do  suspend accounts engaging in that kind of behavior. So why are the stakes higher for this  Well  this could also be a bystander at a rally who managed to record a video of a police officer beating a non violent protester who's trying to let the world know what's happening. We don't want to gamble on potentially silencing that crucial speech by classifying it as spam and suspending it. That means we evaluate hundreds of parameters when looking at account behaviors  and even then  we can still get it wrong and have to reevaluate. Now  given the sorts of challenges I'm up against  it's crucial that I not only predict but also design protections for the unexpected. And that's not just an issue for me  or for Twitter  it's an issue for you. It's an issue for anybody who's building or creating something that you think is going to be amazing and will let people do awesome things. So what do I do  I pause and I think  how could all of this go horribly wrong  I visualize catastrophe. And that's hard. There's a sort of inherent cognitive dissonance in doing that  like when you're writing your wedding vows at the same time as your prenuptial agreement. But you still have to do it  particularly if you're marrying      million tweets per day. What do I mean by  visualize catastrophe   I try to think of how something as benign and innocuous as a picture of a cat could lead to death  and what to do to prevent that. Which happens to be my next example. This is my cat  Eli. We wanted to give users the ability to add photos to their tweets. A picture is worth a thousand words. You only get     characters. You add a photo to your tweet  look at how much more content you've got now. There's all sorts of great things you can do by adding a photo to a tweet. My job isn't to think of those. It's to think of what could go wrong. How could this picture lead to my death  Well  here's one possibility. There's more in that picture than just a cat. There's geodata. When you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera  there's a lot of additional information saved along in that image. In fact  this image also contains the equivalent of this  more specifically  this. Sure  it's not likely that someone's going to try to track me down and do me harm based upon image data associated with a picture I took of my cat  but I start by assuming the worst will happen. That's why  when we launched photos on Twitter  we made the decision to strip that geodata out. If I start by assuming the worst and work backwards  I can make sure that the protections we build work for both expected and unexpected use cases. Given that I spend my days and nights imagining the worst that could happen  it wouldn't be surprising if  my worldview was gloomy. It's not. The vast majority of interactions I see    and I see a lot  believe me    are positive  people reaching out to help or to connect or share information with each other. It's just that for those of us dealing with scale  for those of us tasked with keeping people safe  we have to assume the worst will happen  because for us  a one in a million chance is pretty good odds. Thank you. Looking deeply inside nature  through the magnifying glass of science  designers extract principles  processes and materials that are forming the very basis of design methodology. From synthetic constructs that resemble biological materials  to computational methods that emulate neural processes  nature is driving design. Design is also driving nature. In realms of genetics  regenerative medicine and synthetic biology  designers are growing novel technologies  not foreseen or anticipated by nature. Bionics explores the interplay between biology and design. As you can see  my legs are bionic. Today  I will tell human stories of bionic integration  how electromechanics attached to the body  and implanted inside the body are beginning to bridge the gap between disability and ability  between human limitation and human potential. Bionics has defined my physicality. In       both of my legs were amputated due to tissue damage from frostbite  incurred during a mountain climbing accident. At that time  I didn't view my body as broken. I reasoned that a human being can never be  broken.  Technology is broken. Technology is inadequate. This simple but powerful idea was a call to arms  to advance technology for the elimination of my own disability  and ultimately  the disability of others. I began by developing specialized limbs that allowed me to return to the vertical world of rock and ice climbing. I quickly realized that the artificial part of my body is malleable  able to take on any form  any function    a blank slate for which to create  perhaps  structures that could extend beyond biological capability. I made my height adjustable. I could be as short as five feet or as tall as I'd like. So when I was feeling bad about myself  insecure  I would jack my height up. But when I was feeling confident and suave  I would knock my height down a notch  just to give the competition a chance. Narrow edged feet allowed me to climb steep rock fissures  where the human foot cannot penetrate  and spiked feet enabled me to climb vertical ice walls  without ever experiencing muscle leg fatigue. Through technological innovation  I returned to my sport  stronger and better. Technology had eliminated my disability  and allowed me a new climbing prowess. As a young man  I imagined a future world where technology so advanced could rid the world of disability  a world in which neural implants would allow the visually impaired to see. A world in which the paralyzed could walk  via body exoskeletons. Sadly  because of deficiencies in technology  disability is rampant in the world. This gentleman is missing three limbs. As a testimony to current technology  he is out of the wheelchair  but we need to do a better job in bionics  to allow  one day  full rehabilitation for a person with this level of injury. At the MIT Media Lab  we've established the Center for Extreme Bionics. The mission of the center is to put forth fundamental science and technological capability that will allow the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of humans  across a broad range of brain and body disabilities. Today  I'm going to tell you how my legs function  how they work  as a case in point for this center. Now  I made sure to shave my legs last night  because I knew I'd be showing them off. Bionics entails the engineering of extreme interfaces. There's three extreme interfaces in my bionic limbs  mechanical  how my limbs are attached to my biological body  dynamic  how they move like flesh and bone  and electrical  how they communicate with my nervous system. I'll begin with mechanical interface. In the area of design  we still do not understand how to attach devices to the body mechanically. It's extraordinary to me that in this day and age  one of the most mature  oldest technologies in the human timeline  the shoe  still gives us blisters. How can this be  We have no idea how to attach things to our bodies. This is the beautifully lyrical design work of Professor Neri Oxman at the MIT Media Lab  showing spatially varying exoskeletal impedances  shown here by color variation in this  D printed model. Imagine a future where clothing is stiff and soft where you need it  when you need it  for optimal support and flexibility  without ever causing discomfort. My bionic limbs are attached to my biological body via synthetic skins with stiffness variations  that mirror my underlying tissue biomechanics. To achieve that mirroring  we first developed a mathematical model of my biological limb. To that end  we used imaging tools such as MRI  to look inside my body  to figure out the geometries and locations of various tissues. We also took robotic tools    here's a    actuator circle that goes around the biological limb. The actuators come in  find the surface of the limb  measure its unloaded shape  and then they push on the tissues to measure tissue compliances at each anatomical point. We combine these imaging and robotic data to build a mathematical description of my biological limb  shown on the left. You see a bunch of points  or nodes  At each node  there's a color that represents tissue compliance. We then do a mathematical transformation to the design of the synthetic skin  shown on the right. And we've discovered optimality is  where the body is stiff  the synthetic skin should be soft  where the body is soft  the synthetic skin is stiff  and this mirroring occurs across all tissue compliances. With this framework  we've produced bionic limbs that are the most comfortable limbs I've ever worn. Clearly  in the future  our clothing  our shoes  our braces  our prostheses  will no longer be designed and manufactured using artisan strategies  but rather  data driven quantitative frameworks. In that future  our shoes will no longer give us blisters. We're also embedding sensing and smart materials into the synthetic skins. This is a material developed by SRI International  California. Under electrostatic effect  it changes stiffness. So under zero voltage  the material is compliant  it's floppy like paper. Then the button's pushed  a voltage is applied  and it becomes stiff as a board. We embed this material into the synthetic skin that attaches my bionic limb to my biological body. When I walk here  it's no voltage. My interface is soft and compliant. The button's pushed  voltage is applied  and it stiffens  offering me a greater maneuverability over the bionic limb. We're also building exoskeletons. This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft in just the right areas of the running cycle  to protect the biological joints from high impacts and degradation. In the future  we'll all be wearing exoskeletons in common activities  such as running. Next  dynamic interface. How do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone  At my MIT lab  we study how humans with normal physiologies stand  walk and run. What are the muscles doing  and how are they controlled by the spinal cord  This basic science motivates what we build. We're building bionic ankles  knees and hips. We're building body parts from the ground up. The bionic limbs that I'm wearing are called BiOMs. They've been fitted to nearly       patients      of which have been wounded U.S. soldiers. How does it work  At heel strike  under computer control  the system controls stiffness  to attenuate the shock of the limb hitting the ground. Then at mid stance  the bionic limb outputs high torques and powers to lift the person into the walking stride  comparable to how muscles work in the calf region. This bionic propulsion is very important clinically to patients. So on the left  you see the bionic device worn by a lady  on the right  a passive device worn by the same lady  that fails to emulate normal muscle function  enabling her to do something everyone should be able to do  go up and down their steps at home. Bionics also allows for extraordinary athletic feats. Here's a gentleman running up a rocky pathway. This is Steve Martin    not the comedian    who lost his legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan. We're also building exoskeletal structures using these same principles  that wrap around the biological limb. This gentleman does not have any leg condition  any disability. He has a normal physiology  so these exoskeletons are applying muscle like torques and powers  so that his own muscles need not apply those torques and powers. This is the first exoskeleton in history that actually augments human walking. It significantly reduces metabolic cost. It's so profound in its augmentation  that when a normal  healthy person wears the device for    minutes and then takes it off  their own biological legs feel ridiculously heavy and awkward. We're beginning the age in which machines attached to our bodies will make us stronger and faster and more efficient. Moving on to electrical interface  How do my bionic limbs communicate with my nervous system  Across my residual limb are electrodes that measure the electrical pulse of my muscles. That's communicated to the bionic limb  so when I think about moving my phantom limb  the robot tracks those movement desires. This diagram shows fundamentally how the bionic limb is controlled. So we model the missing biological limb  and we've discovered what reflexes occurred  how the reflexes of the spinal cord are controlling the muscles. And that capability is embedded in the chips of the bionic limb. What we've done  then  is we modulate the sensitivity of the reflex  the modeled spinal reflex  with the neural signal  so when I relax my muscles in my residual limb  I get very little torque and power  but the more I fire my muscles  the more torque I get  and I can even run. And that was the first demonstration of a running gait under neural command. Feels great. We want to go a step further. We want to actually close the loop between the human and the bionic external limb. We're doing experiments where we're growing nerves  transected nerves  through channels  or micro channel arrays. On the other side of the channel  the nerve then attaches to cells  skin cells and muscle cells. In the motor channels  we can sense how the person wishes to move. That can be sent out wirelessly to the bionic limb  then  sensory information  on the bionic limb can be converted to stimulations in adjacent channels  sensory channels. So when this is fully developed and for human use  persons like myself will not only have synthetic limbs that move like flesh and bone  but actually feel like flesh and bone. This video shows Lisa Mallette  shortly after being fitted with two bionic limbs. Indeed  bionics is making a profound difference in people's lives. LM  Oh my God  I can't believe it  LM  It's just like I've got a real leg  Woman  Now  don't start running. Man  Now turn around  and do the same thing walking up  but get on your heel to toe  like you would normally just walk on level ground. Try to walk right up the hill. LM  Oh my God. Man  Is it pushing you up  LM  Yes  I'm not even    I can't even describe it. Man  It's pushing you right up. Hugh Herr  Next week  I'm visiting the Center    Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Next week I'm visiting the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services  and I'm going to try to convince CMS to grant appropriate code language and pricing  so this technology can be made available to the patients that need it. Thank you. It's not well appreciated  but over half of the world's population suffers from some form of cognitive  emotional  sensory or motor condition  and because of poor technology  too often  conditions result in disability and a poorer quality of life. Basic levels of physiological function should be a part of our human rights. Every person should have the right to live life without disability if they so choose    the right to live life without severe depression  the right to see a loved one  in the case of seeing impaired  or the right to walk or to dance  in the case of limb paralysis or limb amputation. As a society  we can achieve these human rights  if we accept the proposition that humans are not disabled. A person can never be broken. Our built environment  our technologies  are broken and disabled. We the people need not accept our limitations  but can transcend disability through technological innovation. Indeed  through fundamental advances in bionics in this century  we will set the technological foundation for an enhanced human experience  and we will end disability. I'd like to finish up with one more story  a beautiful story. The story of Adrianne Haslet Davis. Adrianne lost her left leg in the Boston terrorist attack. I met Adrianne when this photo was taken  at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. Adrianne is a dancer  a ballroom dancer. Adrianne breathes and lives dance. It is her expression. It is her art form. Naturally  when she lost her limb in the Boston terrorist attack  she wanted to return to the dance floor. After meeting her and driving home in my car  I thought  I'm an MIT professor. I have resources. Let's build her a bionic limb  to enable her to go back to her life of dance. I brought in MIT scientists with expertise in prosthetics  robotics  machine learning and biomechanics  and over a     day research period  we studied dance. We brought in dancers with biological limbs  and we studied how they move  what forces they apply on the dance floor  and we took those data  and we put forth fundamental principles of dance  reflexive dance capability  and we embedded that intelligence into the bionic limb. Bionics is not only about making people stronger and faster. Our expression  our humanity can be embedded into electromechanics. It was  .  seconds between the bomb blasts in the Boston terrorist attack. In  .  seconds  the criminals and cowards took Adrianne off the dance floor. In     days  we put her back. We will not be intimidated  brought down  diminished  conquered or stopped by acts of violence. Ladies and gentlemen  please allow me to introduce Adrianne Haslet Davis  her first performance since the attack. She's dancing with Christian Lightner. Ladies and gentlemen  members of the research team  Elliott Rouse and Nathan Villagaray Carski. Elliott and Nathan. The world makes you something that you're not  but you know inside what you are  and that question burns in your heart  How will you become that  I may be somewhat unique in this  but I am not alone  not alone at all. So when I became a fashion model  I felt that I'd finally achieved the dream that I'd always wanted since I was a young child. My outside self finally matched my inner truth  my inner self. For complicated reasons which I'll get to later  when I look at this picture  at that time I felt like  Geena  you've done it  you've made it  you have arrived. But this past October  I realized that I'm only just beginning. All of us are put in boxes by our family  by our religion  by our society  our moment in history  even our own bodies. Some people have the courage to break free  not to accept the limitations imposed by the color of their skin or by the beliefs of those that surround them. Those people are always the threat to the status quo  to what is considered acceptable. In my case  for the last nine years  some of my neighbors  some of my friends  colleagues  even my agent  did not know about my history. I think  in mystery  this is called the reveal. Here is mine. I was assigned boy at birth based on the appearance of my genitalia. I remember when I was five years old in the Philippines walking around our house  I would always wear this t shirt on my head. And my mom asked me   How come you always wear that t shirt on your head   I said   Mom  this is my hair. I'm a girl.  I knew then how to self identify. Gender has always been considered a fact  immutable  but we now know it's actually more fluid  complex and mysterious. Because of my success  I never had the courage to share my story  not because I thought what I am is wrong  but because of how the world treats those of us who wish to break free. Every day  I am so grateful because I am a woman. I have a mom and dad and family who accepted me for who I am. Many are not so fortunate. There's a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender. There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion. There is a Hindu goddess  hijra goddess. So when I was eight years old  I was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating these mysteries. I was in front of the stage  and I remember  out comes this beautiful woman right in front of me  and I remember that moment something hit me  That is the kind of woman I would like to be. So when I was    years old  still dressing as a boy  I met this woman named T.L. She is a transgender beauty pageant manager. That night she asked me   How come you are not joining the beauty pageant   She convinced me that if I joined that she would take care of the registration fee and the garments  and that night  I won best in swimsuit and best in long gown and placed second runner up among    plus candidates. That moment changed my life. All of a sudden  I was introduced to the world of beauty pageants. Not a lot of people could say that your first job is a pageant queen for transgender women  but I'll take it. So from    to    years old  I joined the most prestigious pageant to the pageant where it's at the back of the truck  literally  or sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field  and when it rains    it rains a lot in the Philippines    the organizers would have to move it inside someone's house. I also experienced the goodness of strangers  especially when we would travel in remote provinces in the Philippines. But most importantly  I met some of my best friends in that community. In       my mom  who had moved to San Francisco  called me and told me that my green card petition came through  that I could now move to the United States. I resisted it. I told my mom   Mom  I'm having fun. I'm here with my friends  I love traveling  being a beauty pageant queen.  But then two weeks later she called me  she said   Did you know that if you move to the United States you could change your name and gender marker   That was all I needed to hear. My mom also told me to put two E's in the spelling of my name. She also came with me when I had my surgery in Thailand at    years old. It's interesting  in some of the most rural cities in Thailand  they perform some of the most prestigious  safe and sophisticated surgery. At that time in the United States  you needed to have surgery before you could change your name and gender marker. So in       I moved to San Francisco  and I remember looking at my California driver's license with the name Geena and gender marker F. That was a powerful moment. For some people  their I.D. is their license to drive or even to get a drink  but for me  that was my license to live  to feel dignified. All of a sudden  my fears were minimized. I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York and be a model. Many are not so fortunate. I think of this woman named Islan Nettles. She's from New York  she's a young woman who was courageously living her truth  but hatred ended her life. For most of my community  this is the reality in which we live. Our suicide rate is nine times higher than that of the general population. Every November     we have a global vigil for Transgender Day of Remembrance. I'm here at this stage because it's a long history of people who fought and stood up for injustice. This is Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera. Today  this very moment  is my real coming out. I could no longer live my truth for and by myself. I want to do my best to help others live their truth without shame and terror. I am here  exposed  so that one day there will never be a need for a November    vigil. My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am. Will you  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Kathryn Schulz  Geena  one quick question for you. I'm wondering what you would say  especially to parents  but in a more broad way  to friends  to family  to anyone who finds themselves encountering a child or a person who is struggling with and uncomfortable with a gender that's being assigned them  what might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and caring and kind family members to them  Geena Rocero  Sure. Well  first  really  I'm so blessed. The support system  with my mom especially  and my family  that in itself is just so powerful. I remember every time I would coach young trans women  I would mentor them  and sometimes when they would call me and tell me that their parents can't accept it  I would pick up that phone call and tell my mom   Mom  can you call this woman   And sometimes it works  sometimes it doesn't  so   But it's just  gender identity is in the core of our being  right  I mean  we're all assigned gender at birth  so what I'm trying to do is to have this conversation that sometimes that gender assignment doesn't match  and there should be a space that would allow people to self identify  and that's a conversation that we should have with parents  with colleagues. The transgender movement  it's at the very beginning  to compare to how the gay movement started. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done. There should be an understanding. There should be a space of curiosity and asking questions  and I hope all of you guys will be my allies. KS  Thank you. That was so lovely. GR  Thank you. Daffodil Hudson  Hello  Yeah  this is she.

I'll make a TED Talk out of you.     I'll make a TED Talk out of you.     I'll make a TED Talk out of you.     Brought to you by TED staff and friends   If you look deep into the night sky  you see stars  and if you look further  you see more stars  and further  galaxies  and  further  more galaxies. But if you keep looking further and further  eventually you see nothing for a long while  and then finally you see a faint  fading afterglow  and it's the afterglow of the Big Bang. Now  the Big Bang was an era in the early universe when everything we see in the night sky was condensed into an incredibly small  incredibly hot  incredibly roiling mass  and from it sprung everything we see. Now  we've mapped that afterglow with great precision  and when I say we  I mean people who aren't me. We've mapped the afterglow with spectacular precision  and one of the shocks about it is that it's almost completely uniform. Fourteen billion light years that way and    billion light years that way  it's the same temperature. Now it's been    billion years since that Big Bang  and so it's got faint and cold. It's now  .  degrees. But it's not exactly  .  degrees. It's only  .  degrees to about    parts in a million. Over here  it's a little hotter  and over there  it's a little cooler  and that's incredibly important to everyone in this room  because where it was a little hotter  there was a little more stuff  and where there was a little more stuff  we have galaxies and clusters of galaxies and superclusters and all the structure you see in the cosmos. And those small  little  inhomogeneities     parts in a million  those were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles in that early universe that were stretched across the size of the entire cosmos. That is spectacular  and that's not what they found on Monday  what they found on Monday is cooler. So here's what they found on Monday  Imagine you take a bell  and you whack the bell with a hammer. What happens  It rings. But if you wait  that ringing fades and fades and fades until you don't notice it anymore. Now  that early universe was incredibly dense  like a metal  way denser  and if you hit it  it would ring  but the thing ringing would be the structure of space time itself  and the hammer would be quantum mechanics. What they found on Monday was evidence of the ringing of the space time of the early universe  what we call gravitational waves from the fundamental era  and here's how they found it. Those waves have long since faded. If you go for a walk  you don't wiggle. Those gravitational waves in the structure of space are totally invisible for all practical purposes. But early on  when the universe was making that last afterglow  the gravitational waves put little twists in the structure of the light that we see. So by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper    in fact  these guys spent three years on the South Pole looking straight up through the coldest  clearest  cleanest air they possibly could find looking deep into the night sky and studying that glow and looking for the faint twists which are the symbol  the signal  of gravitational waves  the ringing of the early universe. And on Monday  they announced that they had found it. And the thing that's so spectacular about that to me is not just the ringing  though that is awesome. The thing that's totally amazing  the reason I'm on this stage  is because what that tells us is something deep about the early universe. It tells us that we and everything we see around us are basically one large bubble    and this is the idea of inflation  one large bubble surrounded by something else. This isn't conclusive evidence for inflation  but anything that isn't inflation that explains this will look the same. This is a theory  an idea  that has been around for a while  and we never thought we we'd really see it. For good reasons  we thought we'd never see killer evidence  and this is killer evidence. But the really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger  roiling pot of universal stuff. We're never going to see the stuff outside  but by going to the South Pole and spending three years looking at the detailed structure of the night sky  we can figure out that we're probably in a universe that looks kind of like that. And that amazes me. Thanks a lot. Chris Anderson  So  this is an interview with a difference. On the basis that a picture is worth a thousand words  what I did was  I asked Bill and Melinda to dig out from their archive some images that would help explain some of what they've done  and do a few things that way. So  we're going to start here. Melinda  when and where was this  and who is that handsome man next to you  Melinda Gates  With those big glasses  huh  This is in Africa  our very first trip  the first time either of us had ever been to Africa  in the fall of     . We were already engaged to be married. We married a few months later  and this was the trip where we really went to see the animals and to see the savanna. It was incredible. Bill had never taken that much time off from work. But what really touched us  actually  were the people  and the extreme poverty. We started asking ourselves questions. Does it have to be like this  And at the end of the trip  we went out to Zanzibar  and took some time to walk on the beach  which is something we had done a lot while we were dating. And we'd already been talking about during that time that the wealth that had come from Microsoft would be given back to society  but it was really on that beach walk that we started to talk about  well  what might we do and how might we go about it  CA  So  given that this vacation led to the creation of the world's biggest private foundation  it's pretty expensive as vacations go.  Laughter  MG  I guess so. We enjoyed it. CA  Which of you was the key instigator here  or was it symmetrical  Bill Gates  Well  I think we were excited that there'd be a phase of our life where we'd get to work together and figure out how to give this money back. At this stage  we were talking about the poorest  and could you have a big impact on them  Were there things that weren't being done  There was a lot we didn't know. Our na vet  is pretty incredible  when we look back on it. But we had a certain enthusiasm that that would be the phase  the post Microsoft phase would be our philanthropy. MG  Which Bill always thought was going to come after he was     so he hasn't quite hit    yet  so some things change along the way. CA  So it started there  but it got accelerated. So that was '    and it was '    really  before the foundation itself started. MA  Yeah  in '    we read an article about diarrheal diseases killing so many kids around the world  and we kept saying to ourselves   Well that can't be. In the U.S.  you just go down to the drug store.  And so we started gathering scientists and started learning about population  learning about vaccines  learning about what had worked and what had failed  and that's really when we got going  was in late           . CA  So  you've got a big pot of money and a world full of so many different issues. How on Earth do you decide what to focus on  BG  Well  we decided that we'd pick two causes  whatever the biggest inequity was globally  and there we looked at children dying  children not having enough nutrition to ever develop  and countries that were really stuck  because with that level of death  and parents would have so many kids that they'd get huge population growth  and that the kids were so sick that they really couldn't be educated and lift themselves up. So that was our global thing  and then in the U.S.  both of us have had amazing educations  and we saw that as the way that the U.S. could live up to its promise of equal opportunity is by having a phenomenal education system  and the more we learned  the more we realized we're not really fulfilling that promise. And so we picked those two things  and everything the foundation does is focused there. CA  So  I asked each of you to pick an image that you like that illustrates your work  and Melinda  this is what you picked. What's this about  MG  So I  one of the things I love to do when I travel is to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women  whether it's Bangladesh  India  lots of countries in Africa  and I go in as a Western woman without a name. I don't tell them who I am. Pair of khakis. And I kept hearing from women  over and over and over  the more I traveled   I want to be able to use this shot.  I would be there to talk to them about childhood vaccines  and they would bring the conversation around to  But what about the shot I get   which is an injection they were getting called Depo Provera  which is a contraceptive. And I would come back and talk to global health experts  and they'd say   Oh no  contraceptives are stocked in in the developing world.  Well  you had to dig deeper into the reports  and this is what the team came to me with  which is  to have the number one thing that women tell you in Africa they want to use stocked out more than     days a year explains why women were saying to me   I walked    kilometers without my husband knowing it  and I got to the clinic  and there was nothing there.  And so condoms were stocked in in Africa because of all the AIDS work that the U.S. and others supported. But women will tell you over and over again   I can't negotiate a condom with my husband. I'm either suggesting he has AIDS or I have AIDS  and I need that tool because then I can space the births of my children  and I can feed them and have a chance of educating them.  CA  Melinda  you're Roman Catholic  and you've often been embroiled in controversy over this issue  and on the abortion question  on both sides  really. How do you navigate that  MG  Yeah  so I think that's a really important point  which is  we had backed away from contraceptives as a global community. We knew that     million women were saying they wanted access to contraceptives  even the contraceptives we have here in the United States  and we weren't providing them because of the political controversy in our country  and to me that was just a crime  and I kept looking around trying to find the person that would get this back on the global stage  and I finally realized I just had to do it. And even though I'm Catholic  I believe in contraceptives just like most of the Catholic women in the United States who report using contraceptives  and I shouldn't let that controversy be the thing that holds us back. We used to have consensus in the United States around contraceptives  and so we got back to that global consensus  and actually raised  .  billion dollars around exactly this issue for women. CA  Bill  this is your graph. What's this about  BG  Well  my graph has numbers on it. I really like this graph. This is the number of children who die before the age of five every year. And what you find is really a phenomenal success story which is not widely known  that we are making incredible progress. We go from    million not long after I was born to now we're down to about six million. So this is a story largely of vaccines. Smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year. That was eradicated  so that got down to zero. Measles was killing a couple million a year. That's down to a few hundred thousand. Anyway  this is a chart where you want to get that number to continue  and it's going to be possible  using the science of new vaccines  getting the vaccines out to kids. We can actually accelerate the progress. The last decade  that number has dropped faster than ever in history  and so I just love the fact that you can say  okay  if we can invent new vaccines  we can get them out there  use the very latest understanding of these things  and get the delivery right  that we can perform a miracle. CA  I mean  you do the math on this  and it works out  I think  literally to thousands of kids' lives saved every day compared to the prior year. It's not reported. An airliner with     plus deaths is a far  far bigger story than that. Does that drive you crazy  BG  Yeah  because it's a silent thing going on. It's a kid  one kid at a time. Ninety eight percent of this has nothing to do with natural disasters  and yet  people's charity  when they see a natural disaster  are wonderful. It's incredible how people think  okay  that could be me  and the money flows. These causes have been a bit invisible. Now that the Millennium Development Goals and various things are getting out there  we are seeing some increased generosity  so the goal is to get this well below a million  which should be possible in our lifetime. CA  Maybe it needed someone who is turned on by numbers and graphs rather than just the big  sad face to get engaged. I mean  you've used it in your letter this year  you used basically this argument to say that aid  contrary to the current meme that aid is kind of worthless and broken  that actually it has been effective. BG  Yeah  well people can take  there is some aid that was well meaning and didn't go well. There's some venture capital investments that were well meaning and didn't go well. You shouldn't just say  okay  because of that  because we don't have a perfect record  this is a bad endeavor. You should look at  what was your goal  How are you trying to uplift nutrition and survival and literacy so these countries can take care of themselves  and say wow  this is going well  and be smarter. We can spend aid smarter. It is not all a panacea. We can do better than venture capital  I think  including big hits like this. CA  Traditional wisdom is that it's pretty hard for married couples to work together. How have you guys managed it  MG  Yeah  I've had a lot of women say to me   I really don't think I could work with my husband. That just wouldn't work out.  You know  we enjoy it  and we don't    this foundation has been a coming to for both of us in its continuous learning journey  and we don't travel together as much for the foundation  actually  as we used to when Bill was working at Microsoft. We have more trips where we're traveling separately  but I always know when I come home  Bill's going to be interested in what I learned  whether it's about women or girls or something new about the vaccine delivery chain  or this person that is a great leader. He's going to listen and be really interested. And he knows when he comes home  even if it's to talk about the speech he did or the data or what he's learned  I'm really interested  and I think we have a really collaborative relationship. But we don't every minute together  that's for sure. CA  But now you are  and we're very happy that you are. Melinda  early on  you were basically largely running the show. Six years ago  I guess  Bill came on full time  so moved from Microsoft and became full time. That must have been hard  adjusting to that. No  MG  Yeah. I think actually  for the foundation employees  there was way more angst for them than there was for me about Bill coming. I was actually really excited. I mean  Bill made this decision even obviously before it got announced in       and it was really his decision  but again  it was a beach vacation where we were walking on the beach and he was starting to think of this idea. And for me  the excitement of Bill putting his brain and his heart against these huge global problems  these inequities  to me that was exciting. Yes  the foundation employees had angst about that. CA  That's cool. MG  But that went away within three months  once he was there. BG  Including some of the employees. MG  That's what I said  the employees  it went away for them three months after you were there. BG  No  I'm kidding. MG  Oh  you mean  the employees didn't go away. BG  A few of them did  but   CA  So what do you guys argue about  Sunday     o'clock  you're away from work  what comes up  What's the argument  BG  Because we built this thing together from the beginning  it's this great partnership. I had that with Paul Allen in the early days of Microsoft. I had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger  and now Melinda  and in even stronger  equal ways  is the partner  so we talk a lot about which things should we give more to  which groups are working well  She's got a lot of insight. She'll sit down with the employees a lot. We'll take the different trips she described. So there's a lot of collaboration. I can't think of anything where one of us had a super strong opinion about one thing or another  CA  How about you  Melinda   though  Can you   Laughter  You never know. MG  Well  here's the thing. We come at things from different angles  and I actually think that's really good. So Bill can look at the big data and say   I want to act based on these global statistics.  For me  I come at it from intuition. I meet with lots of people on the ground and Bill's taught me to take that and read up to the global data and see if they match  and I think what I've taught him is to take that data and meet with people on the ground to understand  can you actually deliver that vaccine  Can you get a woman to accept those polio drops in her child's mouth  Because the delivery piece is every bit as important as the science. So I think it's been more a coming to over time towards each other's point of view  and quite frankly  the work is better because of it. CA  So  in vaccines and polio and so forth  you've had some amazing successes. What about failure  though  Can you talk about a failure and maybe what you've learned from it  BG  Yeah. Fortunately  we can afford a few failures  because we've certainly had them. We do a lot of drug work or vaccine work that you know you're going to have different failures. Like  we put out  one that got a lot of publicity was asking for a better condom. Well  we got hundreds of ideas. Maybe a few of those will work out. We were very na ve  certainly I was  about a drug for a disease in India  visceral leishmaniasis  that I thought  once I got this drug  we can just go wipe out the disease. Well  turns out it took an injection every day for    days. It took three more years to get it than we expected  and then there was no way it was going to get out there. Fortunately  we found out that if you go kill the sand flies  you probably can have success there  but we spent five years  you could say wasted five years  and about    million  on a path that turned out to have very modest benefit when we got there. CA  You're spending  like  a billion dollars a year in education  I think  something like that. Is anything  the story of what's gone right there is quite a long and complex one. Are there any failures that you can talk about  MG  Well  I would say a huge lesson for us out of the early work is we thought that these small schools were the answer  and small schools definitely help. They bring down the dropout rate. They have less violence and crime in those schools. But the thing that we learned from that work  and what turned out to be the fundamental key  is a great teacher in front of the classroom. If you don't have an effective teacher in the front of the classroom  I don't care how big or small the building is  you're not going to change the trajectory of whether that student will be ready for college. CA  So Melinda  this is you and your eldest daughter  Jenn. And just taken about three weeks ago  I think  three or four weeks ago. Where was this  MG  So we went to Tanzania. Jenn's been to Tanzania. All our kids have been to Africa quite a bit  actually. And we did something very different  which is  we decided to go spend two nights and three days with a family. Anna and Sanare are the parents. They invited us to come and stay in their boma. Actually  the goats had been there  I think  living in that particular little hut on their little compound before we got there. And we stayed with their family  and we really  really learned what life is like in rural Tanzania. And the difference between just going and visiting for half a day or three quarters of a day versus staying overnight was profound  and so let me just give you one explanation of that. They had six children  and as I talked to Anna in the kitchen  we cooked for about five hours in the cooking hut that day  and as I talked to her  she had absolutely planned and spaced with her husband the births of their children. It was a very loving relationship. This was a Maasai warrior and his wife  but they had decided to get married  they clearly had respect and love in the relationship. Their children  their six children  the two in the middle were twins      a boy  and a girl named Grace. And when we'd go out to chop wood and do all the things that Grace and her mother would do  Grace was not a child  she was an adolescent  but she wasn't an adult. She was very  very shy. So she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn. We kept trying to engage her  but she was shy. And at night  though  when all the lights went out in rural Tanzania  and there was no moon that night  the first night  and no stars  and Jenn came out of our hut with her REI little headlamp on  Grace went immediately  and got the translator  came straight up to my Jenn and said   When you go home  can I have your headlamp so I can study at night   CA  Oh  wow. MG  And her dad had told me how afraid he was that unlike the son  who had passed his secondary exams  because of her chores  she'd not done so well and wasn't in the government school yet. He said   I don't know how I'm going to pay for her education. I can't pay for private school  and she may end up on this farm like my wife.  So they know the difference that an education can make in a huge  profound way. CA  I mean  this is another pic of your other two kids  Rory and Phoebe  along with Paul Farmer. Bringing up three children when you're the world's richest family seems like a social experiment without much prior art. How have you managed it  What's been your approach  BG  Well  I'd say overall the kids get a great education  but you've got to make sure they have a sense of their own ability and what they're going to go and do  and our philosophy has been to be very clear with them    most of the money's going to the foundation    and help them find something they're excited about. We want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything but not a lot of money showered on them so they could go out and do nothing. And so far  they're fairly diligent  excited to pick their own direction. CA  You've obviously guarded their  privacy carefully for obvious reasons. I'm curious why you've given me permission to show this picture now here at TED. MG  Well  it's interesting. As they get older  they so know that our family belief is about responsibility  that we are in an unbelievable situation just to live in the United States and have a great education  and we have a responsibility to give back to the world. And so as they get older and we are teaching them    they have been to so many countries around the world   they're saying  we do want people to know that we believe in what you're doing  Mom and Dad  and it is okay to show us more. So we have their permission to show this picture  and I think Paul Farmer is probably going to put it eventually in some of his work. But they really care deeply about the mission of the foundation  too. CA  You've easily got enough money despite your vast contributions to the foundation to make them all billionaires. Is that your plan for them  BG  Nope. No. They won't have anything like that. They need to have a sense that their own work is meaningful and important. We read an article long  actually  before we got married  where Warren Buffett talked about that  and we're quite convinced that it wasn't a favor either to society or to the kids. CA  Well  speaking of Warren Buffett  something really amazing happened in       when somehow your only real rival for richest person in America suddenly turned around and agreed to give    percent of his fortune to your foundation. How on Earth did that happen  I guess there's a long version and a short version of that. We've got time for the short version. BG  All right. Well  Warren was a close friend  and he was going to have his wife Suzie give it all away. Tragically  she passed away before he did  and he's big on delegation  and    Laughter    he said   CA  Tweet that. BG  If he's got somebody who is doing something well  and is willing to do it at no charge  maybe that's okay. But we were stunned. MG  Totally stunned. BG  We had never expected it  and it has been unbelievable. It's allowed us to increase our ambition in what the foundation can do quite dramatically. Half the resources we have come from Warren's mind blowing generosity. CA  And I think you've pledged that by the time you're done  more than  or    percent of your wealth  will be given to the foundation. BG  Yes. CA  And since this relationship  it's amazing  And recently  you and Warren have been going around trying to persuade other billionaires and successful people to pledge to give  what  more than half of their assets for philanthropy. How is that going  BG  Well  we've got about     people who have now taken this giving pledge. The thing that's great is that we get together yearly and talk about  okay  do you hire staff  what do you give to them  We're not trying to homogenize it. I mean  the beauty of philanthropy is this mind blowing diversity. People give to some things. We look and go   Wow.  But that's great. That's the role of philanthropy is to pick different approaches  including even in one space  like education. We need more experimentation. But it's been wonderful  meeting those people  sharing their journey to philanthropy  how they involve their kids  where they're doing it differently  and it's been way more successful than we expected. Now it looks like it'll just keep growing in size in the years ahead. MG  And having people see that other people are making change with philanthropy  I mean  these are people who have created their own businesses  put their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas. If they put their ideas and their brain behind philanthropy  they can change the world. And they start to see others doing it  and saying   Wow  I want to do that with my own money.  To me  that's the piece that's incredible. CA  It seems to me  it's actually really hard for some people to figure out even how to remotely spend that much money on something else. There are probably some billionaires in the room and certainly some successful people. I'm curious  can you make the pitch  What's the pitch  BG  Well  it's the most fulfilling thing we've ever done  and you can't take it with you  and if it's not good for your kids  let's get together and brainstorm about what we can be done. The world is a far better place because of the philanthropists of the past  and the U.S. tradition here  which is the strongest  is the envy of the world. And part of the reason I'm so optimistic is because I do think philanthropy is going to grow and take some of these things government's not just good at working on and discovering and shine some light in the right direction. CA  The world's got this terrible inequality  growing inequality problem that seems structural. It does seem to me that if more of your peers took the approach that you two have made  it would make a dent both in that problem and certainly in the perception of that problem. Is that a fair comment  BG  Oh yeah. If you take from the most wealthy and give to the least wealthy  it's good. It tries to balance out  and that's just. MG  But you change systems. In the U.S.  we're trying to change the education system so it's just for everybody and it works for all students. That  to me  really changes the inequality balance. BG  That's the most important. CA  Well  I really think that most people here and many millions around the world are just in awe of the trajectory your lives have taken and the spectacular degree to which you have shaped the future. Thank you so much for coming to TED and for sharing with us and for all you do. BG  Thank you. MG  Thank you. BG  Thank you. MG  Thank you very much. BG  All right  good job.  Applause  If you remember that first decade of the web  it was really a static place. You could go online  you could look at pages  and they were put up either by organizations who had teams to do it or by individuals who were really tech savvy for the time. And with the rise of social media and social networks in the early     s  the web was completely changed to a place where now the vast majority of content we interact with is put up by average users  either in YouTube videos or blog posts or product reviews or social media postings. And it's also become a much more interactive place  where people are interacting with others  they're commenting  they're sharing  they're not just reading. So Facebook is not the only place you can do this  but it's the biggest  and it serves to illustrate the numbers. Facebook has  .  billion users per month. So half the Earth's Internet population is using Facebook. They are a site  along with others  that has allowed people to create an online persona with very little technical skill  and people responded by putting huge amounts of personal data online. So the result is that we have behavioral  preference  demographic data for hundreds of millions of people  which is unprecedented in history. And as a computer scientist   what this means is that I've been able to build models that can predict all sorts of hidden attributes for all of you that you don't even know you're sharing information about. As scientists  we use that to help the way people interact online  but there's less altruistic applications  and there's a problem in that users don't really understand these techniques and how they work  and even if they did  they don't have a lot of control over it. So what I want to talk to you about today is some of these things that we're able to do  and then give us some ideas of how we might go forward to move some control back into the hands of users. So this is Target  the company. I didn't just put that logo on this poor  pregnant woman's belly. You may have seen this anecdote that was printed in Forbes magazine where Target sent a flyer to this    year old girl with advertisements and coupons for baby bottles and diapers and cribs two weeks before she told her parents that she was pregnant. Yeah  the dad was really upset. He said   How did Target figure out that this high school girl was pregnant before she told her parents   It turns out that they have the purchase history for hundreds of thousands of customers and they compute what they  call a pregnancy score  which is not just whether or  not a woman's pregnant  but what her due date is. And they compute that not by looking at the obvious things  like  she's buying a crib or baby clothes  but things like  she bought more vitamins than she normally had  or she bought a handbag that's big enough to hold diapers. And by themselves  those purchases don't seem like they might reveal a lot  but it's a pattern of behavior that  when you take it in the context  of thousands of other people  starts to actually reveal some insights. So that's the kind of thing that we do when we're predicting stuff about you on social media. We're looking for little patterns of behavior that  when you detect them among millions of people  lets us find out all kinds of things. So in my lab and with colleagues  we've developed mechanisms where we can quite accurately predict things like your political preference  your personality score  gender  sexual orientation  religion  age  intelligence  along with things like how much you trust the people you know and how strong those relationships are. We can do all of this really well. And again  it doesn't come from what you might think of as obvious information. So my favorite example is from this study that was published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academies. If you Google this  you'll find it. It's four pages  easy to read. And they looked at just people's Facebook likes  so just the things you like on Facebook  and used that to predict all these attributes  along with some other ones. And in their paper they listed the five likes that were most indicative of high intelligence. And among those was liking a page for curly fries.  Laughter  Curly fries are delicious  but liking them does not necessarily mean that you're smarter than the average person. So how is it that one of the strongest indicators of your intelligence is liking this page when the content is totally irrelevant to the attribute that's being predicted  And it turns out that we have to look at a whole bunch of underlying theories to see why we're able to do this. One of them is a sociological theory called homophily  which basically says people are friends with people like them. So if you're smart  you tend to be friends with smart people  and if you're young  you tend to be friends with young people  and this is well established for hundreds of years. We also know a lot about how information spreads through networks. It turns out things like viral videos or Facebook likes or other information spreads in exactly the same way that diseases spread through social networks. So this is something we've studied for a long time. We have good models of it. And so you can put those things together and start seeing why things like this happen. So if I were to give you a hypothesis  it would be that a smart guy started this page  or maybe one of the first people who liked it would have scored high on that test. And they liked it  and their friends saw it  and by homophily  we know that he probably had smart friends  and so it spread to them   and some of them liked it  and they had smart friends  and so it spread to them  and so it propagated through the network to a host of smart people  so that by the end  the action of liking the curly fries page is indicative of high intelligence  not because of the content  but because the actual action of liking reflects back the common attributes of other people who have done it. So this is pretty complicated stuff  right  It's a hard thing to sit down and explain to an average user  and even if you do  what can the average user do about it  How do you know that  you've liked something that indicates a trait for you that's totally irrelevant to the content of what you've liked  There's a lot of power that users don't have to control how this data is used. And I see that as a real  problem going forward. So I think there's a couple paths that we want to look at if we want to give users some control over how this data is used  because it's not always going to be used for their benefit. An example I often give is that  if I ever get bored being a professor  I'm going to go start a company that predicts all of these attributes and things like how well you work in teams and if you're a drug user  if you're an alcoholic. We know how to predict all that. And I'm going to sell reports to H.R. companies and big businesses that want to hire you. We totally can do that now. I could start that business tomorrow  and you would have absolutely no control over me using your data like that. That seems to me to be a problem. So one of the paths we can go down is the policy and law path. And in some respects  I think that that would be most effective  but the problem is we'd actually have to do it. Observing our political process in action makes me think it's highly unlikely that we're going to get a bunch of representatives to sit down  learn about this  and then enact sweeping changes to intellectual property law in the U.S. so users control their data. We could go the policy route  where social media companies say  you know what  You own your data. You have total control over how it's used. The problem is that the revenue models for most social media companies rely on sharing or exploiting  users' data in some way. It's sometimes said of Facebook that the users aren't the customer  they're the product. And so how do you get a company to cede control of their main asset back to the users  It's possible  but I don't think it's something that we're going to see change quickly. So I think the other path that we can go down that's going to be more effective is one of more science. It's doing science that allowed us to develop all these mechanisms for computing this personal data in the first place. And it's actually very similar research that we'd have to do if we want to develop mechanisms that can say to a user   Here's the risk of that action you just took.  By liking that Facebook page  or by sharing this piece of personal information  you've now improved my ability to predict whether or not you're using drugs or whether or not you get along well in the workplace. And that  I think  can affect whether or not people want to share something  keep it private  or just keep it offline altogether. We can also look at things like allowing people to encrypt data that they upload  so it's kind of invisible and worthless to sites like Facebook or third party services that access it  but that select users who the person who posted it want to see it have access to see it. This is all super exciting research from an intellectual perspective  and so scientists are going to be willing to do it. So that gives us an advantage over the law side. One of the problems that people bring up when I talk about this is  they say  you know  if people start keeping all this data private  all those methods that you've been developing to predict their traits are going to fail. And I say  absolutely  and for me  that's success  because as a scientist  my goal is not to infer information about users  it's to improve the way people interact online. And sometimes that involves inferring things about them  but if users don't want me to use that data  I think they should have the right to do that. I want users to be informed and consenting users of the tools that we develop. And so I think encouraging this kind of science and supporting researchers who want to cede some of that control back to users and away from the social media companies means that going forward  as these tools evolve and advance  means that we're going to have an educated and empowered user base  and I think all of us can agree that that's a pretty ideal way to go forward. Thank you. So a chip  a poet and a boy. It's just about    years ago  June       when Intel announced that there was a flaw at the core of their Pentium chip. Deep in the code of the SRT algorithm to calculate intermediate quotients necessary for iterative floating points of divisions    I don't know what that means  but  it's what it says on Wikipedia   there was a flaw and an error that meant that there was a certain probability that the result of the calculation would be an error  and the probability was one out of every     billion calculations. So Intel said your average spreadsheet would be flawed once every        years. They didn't think it was significant  but there was an outrage in the community. The community  the techies  said  this flaw has to be addressed. They were not going to stand by quietly as Intel gave them these chips. So there was a revolution across the world. People marched to demand    okay  not really exactly like that   but they rose up and they demanded that Intel fix the flaw. And Intel set aside     million dollars to fund the replacement of millions of chips to fix the flaw. So billions of dollars in our society was spent to address a problem which would come once out of every     billion calculations. Number two  a poet. This is Martin Niem ller. You're familiar with his poetry. Around the height of the Nazi period  he started repeating the verse   First they came for the communists  and I did nothing  did not speak out because I was not a communist. Then they came for the socialists. Then they came for the trade unions. Then they came for the Jews. And then they came for me. But there was no one left to speak for me.  Now  Niem ller is offering a certain kind of insight. This is an insight at the core of intelligence. We could call it cluefulness. It's a certain kind of test  Can you recognize an underlying threat and respond  Can you save yourself or save your kind  Turns out ants are pretty good at this. Cows  not so much. So can you see the pattern  Can you see a pattern and then recognize and do something about it  Number two. Number three  a boy. This is my friend Aaron Swartz. He's Tim's friend. He's friends of many of you in this audience  and seven years ago  Aaron came to me with a question. It was just before I was going to give my first TED Talk. I was so proud. I was telling him about my talk   Laws that choke creativity.  And Aaron looked at me and was a little impatient  and he said   So how are you ever going to solve the problems you're talking about  Copyright policy  Internet policy  how are you ever going to address those problems so long as there's this fundamental corruption in the way our government works   So I was a little put off by this. He wasn't sharing in my celebration. And I said to him   You know  Aaron  it's not my field  not my field.  He said   You mean as an academic  it's not your field   I said   Yeah  as an academic  it's not my field.  He said   What about as a citizen  As a citizen.  Now  this is the way Aaron was. He didn't tell. He asked questions. But his questions spoke as clearly as my four year old's hug. He was saying to me   You've got to get a clue. You have got to get a clue  because there is a flaw at the core of the operating system of this democracy  and it's not a flaw every one out of     billion times our democracy tries to make a decision. It is every time  every single important issue. We've got to end the bovinity of this political society. We've got to adopt  it turns out  the word is fourmi formatic attitude    that's what the Internet tells me the word is    the ant's appreciative attitude that gets us to recognize this flaw  save our kind and save our demos. Now if you know Aaron Swartz  you know that we lost him just over a year ago. It was about six weeks before I gave my TED Talk  and I was so grateful to Chris that he asked me to give this TED Talk  not because I had the chance to talk to you  although that was great  but because it pulled me out of an extraordinary depression. I couldn't begin to describe the sadness. Because I had to focus. I had to focus on  what was I going to say to you  It saved me. But after the buzz  the excitement  the power that comes from this community  I began to yearn for a less sterile  less academic way to address these issues  the issues that I was talking about. We'd begun to focus on New Hampshire as a target for this political movement  because the primary in New Hampshire is so incredibly important. It was a group called the New Hampshire Rebellion that was beginning to talk about  how would we make this issue of this corruption central in       But it was another soul that caught my imagination  a woman named Doris Haddock  aka Granny D. On January             years ago  at the age of     Granny D started a walk. She started in Los Angeles and began to walk to Washington  D.C. with a single sign on her chest that said   campaign finance reform.  Eighteen months later  at the age of     she arrived in Washington with hundreds following her  including many congressmen who had gotten in a car and driven out about a mile outside of the city to walk in with her. Now  I don't have    months to walk across the country. I've got three kids who hate to walk  and a wife who  it turns out  still hates when I'm not there for mysterious reasons  so this was not an option  but the question I asked  could we remix Granny D a bit  What about a walk not of       miles but of     miles across New Hampshire in January  So on January     the anniversary of Aaron's death  we began a walk that ended on January   th  the day that Granny D was born. A total of     people joined us across this walk  as we went from the very top to the very bottom of New Hampshire talking about this issue. And what was astonishing to me  something I completely did not expect to find  was the passion and anger that there was among everyone that we talked to about this issue. We had found in a poll that    percent of Americans believe it important to reduce the influence of money in politics. Now politicians and pundits tell you  there's nothing we can do about this issue  Americans don't care about it  but the reason for that is that    percent of Americans think there's nothing that can be done about this issue. And it's this gap between    and    that explains our politics of resignation. I mean  after all  at least    percent of us wish we could fly like Superman  but because at least    percent of us believe we can't  we don't leap off of tall buildings every time we have that urge. That's because we accept our limits  and so too with this reform. But when you give people the sense of hope  you begin to thaw that absolute sense of impossibility. As Harvey Milk said  if you give 'em hope  you give 'em a chance  a way to think about how this change is possible. Hope. And hope is the one thing that we  Aaron's friends  failed him with  because we let him lose that sense of hope. I loved that boy like I love my son. But we failed him. And I love my country  and I'm not going to fail that. I'm not going to fail that. That sense of hope  we're going to hold  and we're going to fight for  however impossible this battle looks. What's next  Well  we started with this march with     people  and next year  there will be       on different routes that march in the month of January and meet in Concord to celebrate this cause  and then in       before the primary  there will be        who march across that state  meeting in Concord to celebrate this cause. And as we have marched  people around the country have begun to say   Can we do the same thing in our state   So we've started a platform called G.D. Walkers  that is  Granny D walkers  and Granny D walkers across the country will be marching for this reform. Number one. Number two  on this march  one of the founders of Thunderclap  David Cascino  was with us  and he said   Well what can we do   And so they developed a platform  which we are announcing today  that allows us to pull together voters who are committed to this idea of reform. Regardless of where you are  in New Hampshire or outside of New Hampshire  you can sign up and directly be informed where the candidates are on this issue so you can decide who to vote for as a function of which is going to make this possibility real. And then finally number three  the hardest. We're in the age of the Super PAC. Indeed yesterday  Merriam announced that Merriam Webster will have Super PAC as a word. It is now an official word in the dictionary. So on May    aka May Day  we're going to try an experiment. We're going to try a launching of what we can think of as a Super PAC to end all Super PACs. And the basic way this works is this. For the last year  we have been working with analysts and political experts to calculate  how much would it cost to win enough votes in the United States Congress to make fundamental reform possible  What is that number  Half a billion  A billion  What is that number  And then whatever that number is  we are going to kickstart  sort of  because you can't use KickStarter for political work  but anyway  kickstart  sort of  first a bottom up campaign where people will make small dollar commitments contingent on reaching very ambitious goals  and when those goals have been reached  we will turn to the large dollar contributors  to get them to contribute to make it possible for us to run the kind of Super PAC necessary to win this issue  to change the way money influences politics  so that on November    which I discovered yesterday is the day that Aaron would have been    years old  on November    we will celebrate     representatives in the House and    Senators in the United States Senate who have committed to this idea of fundamental reform. So last night  we heard about wishes. Here's my wish. May one. May the ideals of one boy unite one nation behind one critical idea that we are one people  we are the people who were promised a government  a government that was promised to be dependent upon the people alone  the people  who  as Madison told us  meant not the rich more than the poor. May one. And then may you  may you join this movement  not because you're a politician  not because you're an expert  not because this is your field  but because if you are  you are a citizen. Aaron asked me that. Now I've asked you. Thank you very much. When people think about cities  they tend to think of certain things. They think of buildings and streets and skyscrapers  noisy cabs. But when I think about cities  I think about people. Cities are fundamentally about people  and where people go and where people meet are at the core of what makes a city work. So even more important than buildings in a city are the public spaces in between them. And today  some of the most transformative changes in cities are happening in these public spaces. So I believe that lively  enjoyable public spaces are the key to planning a great city. They are what makes it come alive. But what makes a public space work  What attracts people to successful public spaces  and what is it about unsuccessful places that keeps people away  I thought  if I could answer those questions  I could make a huge contribution to my city. But one of the more wonky things about me is that I am an animal behaviorist  and I use those skills not to study animal behavior but to study how people in cities use city public spaces. One of the first spaces that I studied was this little vest pocket park called Paley Park in midtown Manhattan. This little space became a small phenomenon  and because it had such a profound impact on New Yorkers  it made an enormous impression on me. I studied this park very early on in my career because it happened to have been built by my stepfather  so I knew that places like Paley Park didn't happen by accident. I saw firsthand that they required incredible dedication and enormous attention to detail. But what was it about this space that made it special and drew people to it  Well  I would sit in the park and watch very carefully  and first among other things were the comfortable  movable chairs. People would come in  find their own seat  move it a bit  actually  and then stay a while  and then interestingly  people themselves attracted other people  and ironically  I felt more peaceful if there were other people around. And it was green. This little park provided what New Yorkers crave  comfort and greenery. But my question was  why weren't there more places with greenery and places to sit in the middle of the city where you didn't feel alone  or like a trespasser  Unfortunately  that's not how cities were being designed. So here you see a familiar sight. This is how plazas have been designed for generations. They have that stylish  Spartan look that we often associate with modern architecture  but it's not surprising that people avoid spaces like this. They not only look desolate  they feel downright dangerous. I mean  where would you sit here  What would you do here  But architects love them. They are plinths for their creations. They might tolerate a sculpture or two  but that's about it. And for developers  they are ideal. There's nothing to water  nothing to maintain  and no undesirable people to worry about. But don't you think this is a waste  For me  becoming a city planner meant being able to truly change the city that I lived in and loved. I wanted to be able to create places that would give you the feeling that you got in Paley Park  and not allow developers to build bleak plazas like this. But over the many years  I have learned how hard it is to create successful  meaningful  enjoyable public spaces. As I learned from my stepfather  they certainly do not happen by accident  especially in a city like New York  where public space has to be fought for to begin with  and then for them to be successful  somebody has to think very hard about every detail. Now  open spaces in cities are opportunities. Yes  they are opportunities for commercial investment  but they are also opportunities for the common good of the city  and those two goals are often not aligned with one another  and therein lies the conflict. The first opportunity I had to fight for a great public open space was in the early     s  when I was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River. And this sandy wasteland had lain barren for    years  and we were told  unless we found a developer in six months  it would go bankrupt. So we came up with a radical  almost insane idea. Instead of building a park as a complement to future development  why don't we reverse that equation and build a small but very high quality public open space first  and see if that made a difference. So we only could afford to build a two block section of what would become a mile long esplanade  so whatever we built had to be perfect. So just to make sure  I insisted that we build a mock up in wood  at scale  of the railing and the sea wall. And when I sat down on that test bench with sand still swirling all around me  the railing hit exactly at eye level  blocking my view and ruining my experience at the water's edge. So you see  details really do make a difference. But design is not just how something looks  it's how your body feels on that seat in that space  and I believe that successful design always depends on that very individual experience. In this photo  everything looks very finished  but that granite edge  those lights  the back on that bench  the trees in planting  and the many different kinds of places to sit were all little battles that turned this project into a place that people wanted to be. Now  this proved very valuable    years later when Michael Bloomberg asked me to be his planning commissioner and put me in charge of shaping the entire city of New York. And he said to me on that very day  he said that New York was projected to grow from eight to nine million people. And he asked me   So where are you going to put one million additional New Yorkers   Well  I didn't have any idea. Now  you know that New York does place a high value on attracting immigrants  so we were excited about the prospect of growth  but honestly  where were we going to grow in a city that was already built out to its edges and surrounded by water  How were we going to find housing for that many new New Yorkers  And if we couldn't spread out  which was probably a good thing  where could new housing go  And what about cars  Our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars. So what were we going to do  If we couldn't spread out  we had to go up. And if we had to go up  we had to go up in places where you wouldn't need to own a car. So that meant using one of our greatest assets  our transit system. But we had never before thought of how we could make the most of it. So here was the answer to our puzzle. If we were to channel and redirect all new development around transit  we could actually handle that population increase  we thought. And so here was the plan  what we really needed to do  We needed to redo our zoning    and zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool    and basically reshape the entire city  targeting where new development could go and prohibiting any development at all in our car oriented  suburban style neighborhoods. Well  this was an unbelievably ambitious idea  ambitious because communities had to approve those plans. So how was I going to get this done  By listening. So I began listening  in fact  thousands of hours of listening just to establish trust. You know  communities can tell whether or not you understand their neighborhoods. It's not something you can just fake. And so I began walking. I can't tell you how many blocks I walked  in sweltering summers  in freezing winters  year after year  just so I could get to understand the DNA of each neighborhood and know what each street felt like. I became an incredibly geeky zoning expert  finding ways that zoning could address communities' concerns. So little by little  neighborhood by neighborhood  block by block  we began to set height limits so that all new development would be predictable and near transit. Over the course of    years  we were able to rezone     neighborhoods     percent of the city         blocks  so that now     percent of all new development of New York is within a    minute walk of a subway. In other words  nobody in those new buildings needs to own a car. Well  those rezonings were exhausting and enervating and important  but rezoning was never my mission. You can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning. My mission was always to create great public spaces. So in the areas where we zoned for significant development  I was determined to create places that would make a difference in people's lives. Here you see what was two miles of abandoned  degraded waterfront in the neighborhoods of Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn  impossible to get to and impossible to use. Now the zoning here was massive  so I felt an obligation to create magnificent parks on these waterfronts  and I spent an incredible amount of time on every square inch of these plans. I wanted to make sure that there were tree lined paths from the upland to the water  that there were trees and plantings everywhere  and  of course  lots and lots of places to sit. Honestly  I had no idea how it would turn out. I had to have faith. But I put everything that I had studied and learned into those plans. And then it opened  and I have to tell you  it was incredible. People came from all over the city to be in these parks. I know they changed the lives of the people who live there  but they also changed New Yorkers' whole image of their city. I often come down and watch people get on this little ferry that now runs between the boroughs  and I can't tell you why  but I'm completely moved by the fact that people are using it as if it had always been there. And here is a new park in lower Manhattan. Now  the water's edge in lower Manhattan was a complete mess before     . Wall Street was essentially landlocked because you couldn't get anywhere near this edge. And after       the city had very little control. But I thought if we went to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and got money to reclaim this two miles of degraded waterfront that it would have an enormous effect on the rebuilding of lower Manhattan. And it did. Lower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront on all three sides. I really love this park. You know  railings have to be higher now  so we put bar seating at the edge  and you can get so close to the water you're practically on it. And see how the railing widens and flattens out so you can lay down your lunch or your laptop. And I love when people come there and look up and they say   Wow  there's Brooklyn  and it's so close.  So what's the trick  How do you turn a park into a place that people want to be  Well  it's up to you  not as a city planner but as a human being. You don't tap into your design expertise. You tap into your humanity. I mean  would you want to go there  Would you want to stay there  Can you see into it and out of it  Are there other people there  Does it seem green and friendly  Can you find your very own seat  Well now  all over New York City  there are places where you can find your very own seat. Where there used to be parking spaces  there are now pop up cafes. Where Broadway traffic used to run  there are now tables and chairs. Where    years ago  sidewalk cafes were not allowed  they are now everywhere. But claiming these spaces for public use was not simple  and it's even harder to keep them that way. So now I'm going to tell you a story about a very unusual park called the High Line. The High Line was an elevated railway. The High Line was an elevated railway that ran through three neighborhoods on Manhattan's West Side  and when the train stopped running  it became a self seeded landscape  a kind of a garden in the sky. And when I saw it the first time  honestly  when I went up on that old viaduct  I fell in love the way you fall in love with a person  honestly. And when I was appointed  saving the first two sections of the High Line from demolition became my first priority and my most important project. I knew if there was a day that I didn't worry about the High Line  it would come down. And the High Line  even though it is widely known now and phenomenally popular  it is the most contested public space in the city. You might see a beautiful park  but not everyone does. You know  it's true  commercial interests will always battle against public space. You might say   How wonderful it is that more than four million people come from all over the world to visit the High Line.  Well  a developer sees just one thing  customers. Hey  why not take out those plantings and have shops all along the High Line  Wouldn't that be terrific and won't it mean a lot more money for the city  Well no  it would not be terrific. It would be a mall  and not a park. And you know what  it might mean more money for the city  but a city has to take the long view  the view for the common good. Most recently  the last section of the High Line  the third section of the High Line  the final section of the High Line  has been pitted against development interests  where some of the city's leading developers are building more than    million square feet at the Hudson Yards. And they came to me and proposed that they  temporarily disassemble  that third and final section. Perhaps the High Line didn't fit in with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers on a hill. Perhaps it was just in their way. But in any case  it took nine months of nonstop daily negotiation to finally get the signed agreement to prohibit its demolition  and that was only two years ago. So you see  no matter how popular and successful a public space may be  it can never be taken for granted. Public spaces always    this is it saved    public spaces always need vigilant champions  not only to claim them at the outset for public use  but to design them for the people that use them  then to maintain them to ensure that they are for everyone  that they are not violated  invaded  abandoned or ignored. If there is any one lesson that I have learned in my life as a city planner  it is that public spaces have power. It's not just the number of people using them  it's the even greater number of people who feel better about their city just knowing that they are there. Public space can change how you live in a city  how you feel about a city  whether you choose one city over another  and public space is one of the most important reasons why you stay in a city. I believe that a successful city is like a fabulous party. People stay because they are having a great time. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Right now there is an aspiring teacher who is working on a    page paper based on some age old education theory developed by some dead education professor wondering to herself what this task that she's engaging in has to do with what she wants to do with her life  which is be an educator  change lives  and spark magic. Right now there is an aspiring teacher in a graduate school of education who is watching a professor babble on and on about engagement in the most disengaging way possible. Right now there's a first year teacher at home who is pouring through lesson plans trying to make sense of standards  who is trying to make sense of how to grade students appropriately  while at the same time saying to herself over and over again   Don't smile till November   because that's what she was taught in her teacher education program. Right now there's a student who is coming up with a way to convince his mom or dad that he's very  very sick and can't make it to school tomorrow. On the other hand  right now there are amazing educators that are sharing information  information that is shared in such a beautiful way that the students are sitting at the edge of their seats just waiting for a bead of sweat to drop off the face of this person so they can soak up all that knowledge. Right now there is also a person who has an entire audience rapt with attention  a person that is weaving a powerful narrative about a world that the people who are listening have never imagined or seen before  but if they close their eyes tightly enough  they can envision that world because the storytelling is so compelling. Right now there's a person who can tell an audience to put their hands up in the air and they will stay there till he says   Put them down.  Right now. So people will then say   Well  Chris  you describe the guy who is going through some awful training but you're also describing these powerful educators. If you're thinking about the world of education or urban education in particular  these guys will probably cancel each other out  and then we'll be okay.  The reality is  the folks I described as the master teachers  the master narrative builders  the master storytellers are far removed from classrooms. The folks who know the skills about how to teach and engage an audience don't even know what teacher certification means. They may not even have the degrees to be able to have anything to call an education. And that to me is sad. It's sad because the people who I described  they were very disinterested in the learning process  want to be effective teachers  but they have no models. I'm going to paraphrase Mark Twain. Mark Twain says that proper preparation  or teaching  is so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good  it can turn awful practices into powerful ones  it can change men and transform them into angels. The folks who I described earlier got proper preparation in teaching  not in any college or university  but by virtue of just being in the same spaces of those who engage. Guess where those places are  Barber shops  rap concerts  and most importantly  in the black church. And I've been framing this idea called Pentecostal pedagogy. Who here has been to a black church  We got a couple of hands. You go to a black church  their preacher starts off and he realizes that he has to engage the audience  so he starts off with this sort of wordplay in the beginning oftentimes  and then he takes a pause  and he says   Oh my gosh  they're not quite paying attention.  So he says   Can I get an amen   Audience  Amen. Chris Emdin  So I can I get an amen  Audience  Amen. CE  And all of a sudden  everybody's reawoken. That preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention. He drops his voice at a very  very low volume when he wants people to key into him  and those things are the skills that we need for the most engaging teachers. So why does teacher education only give you theory and theory and tell you about standards and tell you about all of these things that have nothing to do with the basic skills  that magic that you need to engage an audience  to engage a student  So I make the argument that we reframe teacher education  that we could focus on content  and that's fine  and we could focus on theories  and that's fine  but content and theories with the absence of the magic of teaching and learning means nothing. Now people oftentimes say   Well  magic is just magic.  There are teachers who  despite all their challenges  who have those skills  get into those schools and are  able to engage an audience  and the administrator walks by and says   Wow  he's so good  I wish all my teachers could be that good.  And when they try to describe what that is  they just say   He has that magic.  But I'm here to tell you that magic can be taught. Magic can be taught. Magic can be taught. Now  how do you teach it  You teach it by allowing people to go into those spaces where the magic is happening. If you want to be an aspiring teacher in urban education  you've got to leave the confines of that university and go into the hood. You've got to go in there and hang out at the barbershop  you've got to attend that black church  and you've got to view those folks that have the power to engage and just take notes on what they do. At our teacher education classes at my university  I've started a project where every single student that comes in there sits and watches rap concerts. They watch the way that the rappers move and talk with their hands. They study the way that he walks proudly across that stage. They listen to his metaphors and analogies  and they start learning these little things that if they practice enough becomes the key to magic. They learn that if you just stare at a student and raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch  you don't have to say a word because they know that that means that you want more. And if we could transform teacher education to focus on teaching teachers how to create that magic then poof  we could make dead classes come alive  we could reignite imaginations  and we can change education. Thank you. What is the intersection between technology  art and science  Curiosity and wonder  because it drives us to explore  because we're surrounded by things we can't see. And I love to use film to take us on a journey through portals of time and space  to make the invisible visible  because what that does  it expands our horizons  it transforms our perception  it opens our minds and it touches our heart. So here are some scenes from my  D IMAX film   Mysteries of the Unseen World.  There is movement which is too slow for our eyes to detect  and time lapse makes us discover and broaden our perspective of life. We can see how organisms emerge and grow  how a vine survives by creeping from the forest floor to look at the sunlight. And at the grand scale  time lapse allows us to see our planet in motion. We can view not only the vast sweep of nature  but the restless movement of humanity. Each streaking dot represents a passenger plane  and by turning air traffic data into time lapse imagery  we can see something that's above us constantly but invisible  the vast network of air travel over the United States. We can do the same thing with ships at sea. We can turn data into a time lapse view of a global economy in motion. And decades of data give us the view of our entire planet as a single organism sustained by currents circulating throughout the oceans and by clouds swirling through the atmosphere  pulsing with lightning  crowned by the aurora Borealis. It may be the ultimate time lapse image  the anatomy of Earth brought to life. At the other extreme  there are things that move too fast for our eyes  but we have technology that can look into that world as well. With high speed cameras  we can do the opposite of time lapse. We can shoot images that are thousands of times faster than our vision. And we can see how nature's ingenious devices work  and perhaps we can even imitate them. When a dragonfly flutters by  you may not realize  but it's the greatest flier in nature. It can hover  fly backwards  even upside down. And by tracking markers on an insect's wings  we can visualize the air flow that they produce. Nobody knew the secret  but high speed shows that a dragonfly can move all four wings in different directions at the same time. And what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places. We're giants  and we're unaware of things that are too small for us to see. The electron microscope fires electrons which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times. This is the egg of a butterfly. And there are unseen creatures living all over your body  including mites that spend their entire lives dwelling on your eyelashes  crawling over your skin at night. Can you guess what this is  Shark skin. A caterpillar's mouth. The eye of a fruit fly. An eggshell. A flea. A snail's tongue. We think we know most of the animal kingdom  but there may be millions of tiny species waiting to be discovered. A spider also has great secrets  because spiders' silk thread is pound for pound stronger than steel but completely elastic. This journey will take us all the way down to the nano world. The silk is     times thinner than human hair. On there is bacteria  and near that bacteria     times smaller  a virus. Inside of that     times smaller  three strands of DNA. And nearing the limit of our most powerful microscopes  single carbon atoms. With the tip of a powerful microscope  we can actually move atoms and begin to create amazing nano devices. Some could one day patrol our body for all kinds of diseases and clean out clogged arteries along the way. Tiny chemical machines of the future can one day  perhaps  repair DNA. We are on the threshold of extraordinary advances  born of our drive to unveil the mysteries of life. So under an endless rain of cosmic dust  the air is full of pollen  micro diamonds and jewels from other planets and supernova explosions. People go about their lives surrounded by the unseeable. Knowing that there's so much around us we can't see forever changes our understanding of the world  and by looking at unseen worlds  we recognize that we exist in the living universe  and this new perspective creates wonder and inspires us to become explorers in our own backyards. Who knows what awaits to be seen and what new wonders will transform our lives. We'll just have to see. Thank you. I was born and raised in Sierra Leone  a small and very beautiful country in West Africa  a country rich both in physical resources and creative talent. However  Sierra Leone is infamous for a decade long rebel war in the '  s when entire villages were burnt down. An estimated       men  women and children had their arms and legs amputated during this time. As my family and I ran for safety when I was about    from one of those attacks  I resolved that I would do everything I could to ensure that my own children would not go through the  same experiences we had. They would  in fact  be part of a Sierra Leone where war and amputation were no longer a strategy for gaining power. As I watched people who I knew  loved ones  recover from this devastation  one thing that deeply troubled me was that many of the amputees in the country would not use their prostheses. The reason  I would come to find out  was that their prosthetic sockets were painful because they did not fit well. The prosthetic socket is the part in which the amputee inserts their residual limb  and which connects to the prosthetic ankle. Even in the developed world  it takes a period of three weeks to often years for a patient to get a comfortable socket  if ever. Prosthetists still use conventional processes like molding and casting to create single material prosthetic sockets. Such sockets often leave intolerable amounts of pressure on the limbs of the patient  leaving them with pressure sores and blisters. It does not matter how powerful your prosthetic ankle is. If your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable  you will not use your leg  and that is just simply unacceptable in our age. So one day  when I met professor Hugh Herr about two and a half years ago  and he asked me if I knew  how to solve this problem  I said   No  not yet  but I would love to figure it out.  And so  for my Ph.D. at the MIT Media Lab  I designed custom prosthetic sockets quickly and cheaply that are more comfortable than conventional prostheses. I used magnetic resonance imaging to capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy  then use finite element modeling to better predict the internal stresses and strains on the normal forces  and then create a prosthetic socket for manufacture. We use a  D printer to create a multi material prosthetic socket which relieves pressure where needed on the anatomy of the patient. In short  we're using data to make novel sockets quickly and cheaply. In a recent trial we just wrapped up at the Media Lab  one of our patients  a U.S. veteran who has been an amputee for about    years and worn dozens of legs  said of one of our printed parts   It's so soft  it's like walking on pillows  and it's effing sexy.  Disability in our age should not prevent anyone from living meaningful lives. My hope and desire is that the tools and processes we develop in our research group can be used to bring highly functional prostheses to those who need them. For me  a place to begin healing the souls of those affected by war and disease is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces for their bodies. Whether it's in Sierra Leone or in Boston  I hope this not only restores but indeed transforms their sense of human potential. Thank you very much. Pat Mitchell  That day  January          began like all others. You were both doing the work that you love. You were meeting with constituents  which is something that you loved doing as a congresswoman  and Mark  you were happily preparing for your next space shuttle. And suddenly  everything  that you had planned or expected in your lives was irrevocably changed forever. Mark Kelly  Yeah  it's amazing  it's amazing how  everything can change for any of us in an instant. People don't realize that. I certainly didn't. Gabby Giffords  Yes. MK  And on that Saturday morning  I got this horrible phone call from Gabby's chief of staff. She didn't have much other information. She just said   Gabby was shot.  A few minutes later  I called her back and I actually thought for a second  well  maybe I just imagined  getting this phone call. I called her back  and  that's when she told me that Gabby had been shot in the head. And from that point on  I knew that our lives were  going to be a lot different. PM  And when you arrived at the hospital  what was the prognosis that they gave you about Gabby's condition  and what recovery  if any  you could expect  MK  Well  for a gunshot wound to the head and a traumatic brain injury  they typically can't tell you much. Every injury is different. It's not predictable like often a stroke might be predictable  which is another TBI kind of injury. So they didn't know how long Gabby would be in a coma  didn't know when that would change and what the prognosis would be. PM  Gabby  has your recovery been an effort to create  a new Gabby Giffords or reclaim the old Gabby Giffords  GG  The new one    better  stronger  tougher. MK  That to say  when you look at the picture behind us  to come back from that kind of injury and come back strong  and stronger than ever is a really tough thing to do. I don't know anybody that's as tough as my  wonderful wife right here. PM  And what were the first signs that recovery was not  only going to be possible but you were going to have some semblance of the life that you and Gabby had planned  MK  Well  the first thing  for me  was Gabby was still kind of almost unconscious  but she did something when she was in the ICU hospital bed that she used to do when we might be out to dinner at a restaurant  in that she pulled my ring off and she flipped it from one finger to the next  and at that point I knew that she was still in there. PM  And there were certain words  too. Didn't she surprise you with  words in the beginning  MK  Well  it was tough in the beginning. GG  What  What  Chicken. Chicken. Chicken. MK  Yeah  that was it. For the first month  that was the extent of Gabby's vocabulary. For some reason  she has aphasia  which is difficulty with communication. She latched on to the word  chicken   which isn't the best but  certainly is not the worst. And we were actually worried it could have been a lot worse than that. PM  Gabby  what's been  the toughest challenge for you during this recovery  GG  Talking. Really hard. Really. MK  Yeah  with aphasia  Gabby knows what she wants to say  she just can't get it out. She understands everything  but the communication is just very difficult because when you look at the picture  the part of your brain where those communication centers are are on the left side of your head  which is where the bullet passed through. PM  So you have to do  a very dangerous thing  speak for your wife. MK  I do. It might be some of the most dangerous things I've ever done. PM  Gabby  are you optimistic about your continuing recovery    walking  talking  being able to move your arm and leg  GG  I'm optimistic. It will be a long  hard haul  but I'm optimistic. PM  That seems to be the number one  characteristic of Gabby Giffords  wouldn't you say   Applause  MK  Gabby's always been really optimistic. She works incredibly hard every day. GG  On the treadmill   walked on my treadmill  Spanish lessons  French horn. MK  It's only my wife who could be    and if you knew her before she was injured  you would kind of understand this    somebody who could be injured and have such a hard time communicating and meets with a speech therapist  and then about a month ago  she says   I want to learn Spanish again.  PM  Well  let's take a little closer look at the wife  and this was even before you met Gabby Giffords. And she's on a motor scooter there  but it's my understanding that's a very tame image of what Gabby Giffords was like growing up. MK  Yeah  Gabby  she  used to race motorcycles. So that's a scooter  but she had    well  she still has a BMW motorcycle. PM  Does she ride it  MK  Well  that's a challenge with not being able to move her right arm  but I think with something I know about  Velcro  we might be able to get her back on the bike  Velcro her right hand up onto the handlebar. PM  I have a feeling we might  see that picture next  Gabby. But you meet  you're already decided that you're going to dedicate  your life to service. You're going into the military and eventually to become an astronaut. So you meet. What attracts you to Gabby  MK  Well  when we met  oddly enough  it was the last time we were in Vancouver  about    years ago. We met in Vancouver  at the airport  on a trip  that we were both taking to China  that I would actually  from my background  I would call it a boondoggle. Gabby would   GG  Fact finding mission. MK  She would call it an important fact finding mission. She was a state senator at the time  and we met here  at the airport  before a trip to China. PM  Would you describe it  as a whirlwind romance  GG  No  no  no. A good friend. MK  Yeah  we were friends for a long time. GG  Yes.  Laughter  MK  And then she invited me on  about a year or so later  she invited me on a date. Where'd we go  Gabby  GG  Death row. MK  Yes. Our first date was to death row at the Florence state prison in Arizona  which was just outside  Gabby's state senate district. They were working on some legislation that had to do with crime and punishment and capital punishment  in the state of Arizona. So she couldn't get anybody  else to go with her  and I'm like   Of course I  want to go to death row.  So that was our first date. We've been together ever since. GG  Yes. PM  Well  that might have contributed to the reason that Gabby decided to marry you. You were willing to go to death row  after all. MK  I guess. PM  Gabby  what did make you want to marry Mark  GG  Um  good friends. Best friends. Best friends. MK  I thought we always had a very special relationship. We've gone through some tough times and it's only made it stronger. GG  Stronger. PM  After you got married  however  you continued very independent lives. Actually  you didn't even live together. MK  We had one of those commuter marriages. In our case  it was Washington  D.C.  Houston  Tucson. Sometimes we'd go clockwise  sometimes counterclockwise  to all those different places  and we didn't really live together until that Saturday morning. Within an hour of Gabby being shot  I was on an airplane to Tucson  and that was the moment where that had changed things. PM  And also  Gabby  you had run for Congress after being a state senator and served in Congress for six years. What did you like best about being in Congress  GG  Fast pace. Fast pace. PM  Well it was the way you did it. GG  Yes  yes. Fast pace. PM  I'm not sure people would describe it entirely that way. MK  Yeah  you know  legislation is often at a colossally slow pace  but my wife  and I have to admit  a lot of other members of Congress that I know  work incredibly hard. I mean  Gabby would run  around like a crazy person  never take a day off  maybe a half a day off a month  and whenever she was awake she was working  and she really  really thrived on that  and still does today. GG  Yes. Yes. PM  Installing solar panels on the top of her house  I have to say. So after the tragic incident  Mark  you decided to resign your position as an astronaut  even though you were supposed to take the next space mission. Everybody  including Gabby  talked you into going back  and you did end up taking. MK  Kind of. The day after Gabby was injured  I called my boss  the chief astronaut  Dr. Peggy Whitson  and I said   Peggy  I know I'm launching in space in three months from now. Gabby's in a coma. I'm in Tucson. You've got to find a replacement for me.  So I didn't actually resign from being an astronaut  but I gave up my job and they found a replacement. Months later  maybe about two months later  I started about getting my job back  which is something  when you become this primary caregiver person  which some people in the audience here have certainly been in that position  it's a challenging role but at some point you've got to figure out when you're going to get your life back  and at the time  I couldn't ask Gabby if she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again. But I knew she was  GG  Yes. Yes. Yes. MK  She was the biggest  supporter of my career  and I knew it was the right thing to do. PM  And yet I'm trying to imagine  Mark  what that was like  going off onto a mission  one presumes safely   but it's never a guarantee  and knowing that Gabby is   MK  Well not only was  she still in the hospital  on the third day of that flight  literally while I was rendezvousing with the space station  and you've got two vehicles moving at        miles an hour  I'm actually flying it  looking out the window  a bunch of computers  Gabby was in brain surgery  literally at that time having the final surgery to replace the piece of skull that they took out on the day she was injured with a prosthetic  yeah  which is the whole side of her head. Now if any of you guys would ever come to our house in Tucson for the first time  Gabby would usually go up to the freezer and pull out the piece of Tupperware that has the real skull.  Laughter  GG  The real skull. MK  Which freaks people out  sometimes. PM  Is that for appetizer or dessert  Mark  MK  Well  it just gets the conversation going. PM  But there was a lot  of conversation about something you did  Gabby  after Mark's flight. You had to make another  step of courage too  because here was  Congress deadlocked again  and you got out of the rehabilitation center  got yourself to Washington so that you could walk  on the floor of the House    I can barely talk about this without getting emotional   and cast a vote which could have been the deciding vote. GG  The debt ceiling. The debt ceiling. MK  Yeah  we had that vote  I guess about five months after Gabby was injured  and she made this bold decision to go back. A very controversial vote  but she wanted to be there to have her voice heard one more time. PM  And after that  resigned and began what has been a very slow and challenging recovery. What's life like  day to day  MK  Well  that's Gabby's service dog Nelson. GG  Nelson. MK  New member of our family. GG  Yes  yes. MK  And we got him from a  GG  Prison. Murder. MK  We have a lot of connections with prisons  apparently.  Laughter  Nelson came from a prison  raised by a murderer in Massachusetts. But she did a great job with this dog. He's a fabulous service dog. PM  So Gabby  what have you learned from your experiences the past few years  MK  Yeah  what have you learned  GG  Deeper. Deeper. PM  Your relationship is deeper. It has to be. You're together all the time now. MK  I imagine being grateful  too  right  GG  Grateful. PM  This is a picture of  family and friends gathering  but I love these pictures because they show the Gabby and Mark relationship now. And you describe it  Gabby  over and over  as deeper on so many levels. Yes  MK  I think when something tragic happens in a family  it can pull people together. Here's us watching the space shuttle fly over Tucson  the Space Shuttle Endeavour  the one that I was the  commander on its last flight  on its final flight on top of an airplane on a     on its way to L.A.  NASA was kind enough  to have it fly over Tucson. PM  And of course  the two of you go through these challenges of a slow and difficult recovery  and yet  Gabby  how do you maintain your optimism and positive outlook  GG  I want to make the world a better place. PM  And you're doing that even though your recovery has to remain front and center for both of you. You are people who have done service to your country and you  are continuing to do that with a new initiative  a new purpose. And Gabby  what's on the agenda now  GG  Americans for Responsible Solutions. MK  That's our political action committee  where we are trying to  get members of Congress to take a more serious look at gun violence in this country  and to try to pass some reasonable legislation. GG  Yes. Yes.  Applause  MK  You know  this affected  us very personally  but it wasn't what happened to Gabby that got us involved. It was really the    murdered first graders and kindergartners in Newtown  Connecticut  and the response that we saw afterwards where    well  look what's happened so far. So far the national response has been pretty much to do nothing. We're trying to change that. PM  There have been    mass shootings since Newtown  a school a week in the first  two months of last year. What are you doing that's different than other efforts to balance rights for gun ownership and responsibilities  MK  We're gun owners   we support gun rights. At the same time  we've  got to do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill. It's not too difficult to do that. This issue  like many others  has become very polarizing and political  and we're trying to bring some balance to the debate in Washington. PM  Thank you both for that effort. And not surprisingly for  this woman of courage and of a sense of adventure  you just keep challenging yourself  and the sky seems to be the limit. I have to share this video of your most recent adventure. Take a look at Gabby. MK  This is a couple months ago. Good stuff. Gorgeous. Oh  thank you. Mountains. Gorgeous mountains. MK  Let me just say one of the guys that Gabby jumped with that day was a Navy SEAL who she met in Afghanistan who was injured in combat  had a really rough time. Gabby visited him when he was at Bethesda and went through a really tough period. He started doing better. Months later  Gabby was shot in the head  and then he supported her while she was in the hospital in Houston. So they have a very  very nice connection. GG  Yes. PM  What a wonderful moment. Because this is the TED stage  Gabby  I know you worked very hard to think of the ideas that you wanted to leave with this audience. GG  Thank you. Hello  everyone. Thank you for inviting us here today. It's been a long  hard haul  but I'm getting better. I'm working hard  lots of therapy    speech therapy  physical therapy  and yoga too. But my spirit is strong as ever. I'm still fighting to make  the world a better place  and you can too. Get involved with your community. Be a leader. Set an example. Be passionate. Be courageous. Be your best. Thank you very much. MK  Thank you. GG  Thank you. MK  Thank you everybody. GG  Bye bye.  Applause  So I've been thinking about the difference between the r sum  virtues and  the eulogy virtues. The r sum  virtues are the ones you put on your r sum   which are the skills  you bring to the marketplace. The eulogy virtues are the ones that get mentioned in the eulogy  which are deeper  who are you   in your depth  what is the nature of your relationships  are you bold  loving  dependable  consistency  And most of us  including  me  would say that the eulogy virtues are the more important of the virtues. But at least in my case   are they the ones that I think about the most   And the answer is no. So I've been thinking about that problem  and a thinker who has  helped me think about it is a guy named Joseph Soloveitchik  who was a rabbi who wrote a book called  The Lonely Man Of Faith  in     . Soloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures  which he called Adam I and Adam II. Adam I is the worldly  ambitious  external side of our nature. He wants to build  create  create companies  create innovation. Adam II is the humble side of our nature. Adam II wants not only  to do good but to be good  to live in a way internally that honors God  creation and our possibilities. Adam I wants to conquer the world. Adam II wants to hear  a calling and obey the world. Adam I savors accomplishment. Adam II savors inner  consistency and strength. Adam I asks how things work. Adam II asks why we're here. Adam I's motto is  success.  Adam II's motto is  love  redemption and return.  And Soloveitchik argued  that these two sides of our nature are  at war with each other. We live in perpetual self confrontation between the external success and the internal value. And the tricky thing   I'd say  about these two sides of our nature is they work by different logics. The external logic is  an economic logic  input leads to output   risk leads to reward. The internal side of our nature is a moral logic and  often an inverse logic. You have to give to receive. You have to surrender  to something outside yourself to gain strength within yourself. You have to conquer the desire to get what you want. In order to fulfill yourself  you have to forget yourself. In order to find yourself   you have to lose yourself. We happen to live in a society  that favors Adam I  and often neglects Adam II. And the problem is  that turns you into a shrewd animal who treats life as a game  and you become a cold   calculating creature who slips into a sort of mediocrity where you realize there's a difference between your desired  self and your actual self. You're not earning the sort of eulogy you want  you hope someone will give to you. You don't have the  depth of conviction. You don't have an emotional sonorousness. You don't have  commitment to tasks that would take more than a lifetime to commit. I was reminded of a common response through history of how you build a solid Adam II  how you build a depth of character. Through history  people  have gone back into their own pasts  sometimes to a precious  time in their life  to their childhood  and often  the mind  gravitates in the past to a moment of shame  some sin committed   some act of selfishness  an act of omission  of shallowness  the sin of anger  the sin of self pity  trying to be a people pleaser   a lack of courage. Adam I is built by  building on your strengths. Adam II is built by fighting  your weaknesses. You go into yourself   you find the sin which you've committed over and again through your life  your signature sin out of which the others emerge  and you fight that sin and you wrestle with that sin  and out of that wrestling   that suffering  then a depth of character is constructed. And we're often not taught to recognize the sin in ourselves  in that we're not taught in this culture how to wrestle with it  how to confront it   and how to combat it. We live in a culture  with an Adam I mentality where we're inarticulate  about Adam II. Finally  Reinhold Niebuhr summed up the confrontation  the fully lived Adam I and Adam II life  this way   Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime  therefore we must  be saved by hope. Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history  therefore we must be saved by faith. Nothing we do  however virtuous  can be accomplished alone  therefore we must  be saved by love. No virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as from our own standpoint. Therefore we must be saved  by that final form of love  which is forgiveness.  Thanks. When I was born  there was really only one book about how to raise your children  and it was written by Dr. Spock. Thank you for indulging me. I have always wanted to do that. No  it was Benjamin Spock  and his book was called  The Common Sense Book of Baby And Child Care.  It sold almost    million copies  by the time he died. Today  I  as the mother of a six year old  walk into Barnes and Noble  and see this. And it is amazing the variety that one finds  on those shelves. There are guides to raising  an eco friendly kid  a gluten free kid  a disease proof kid  which  if you ask me  is a little bit creepy. There are guides to raising a bilingual kid even if you only speak one language at home. There are guides to raising a financially savvy kid and a science minded kid and a kid who is a whiz at yoga. Short of teaching your toddler how to defuse a nuclear bomb  there is pretty much a guide to everything. All of these books are well intentioned. I am sure that many of them are great. But taken together  I am sorry  I do not see help when I look at that shelf. I see anxiety. I see a giant candy colored monument to our collective panic  and it makes me want to know  why is it that raising our children is associated with so much anguish and so much confusion  Why is it that we are at sixes and sevens about the one thing human beings have been doing successfully for millennia  long before parenting message boards and peer reviewed studies came along  Why is it that so many mothers and fathers experience parenthood as a kind of crisis  Crisis might seem like a strong word  but there is data suggesting it probably isn't. There was  in fact  a paper of just this very name   Parenthood as Crisis   published in       and in the    plus years since  there has been plenty of scholarship documenting a pretty clear pattern of parental anguish. Parents experience more stress than non parents. Their marital satisfaction is lower. There have been a number of studies looking at how parents feel when they are spending time with their kids  and the answer often is  not so great. Last year  I spoke with a researcher named Matthew Killingsworth who is doing a very  very imaginative project that tracks people's happiness  and here is what he told me he found   Interacting with your friends is better than interacting with your spouse  which is better than interacting with other relatives  which is better than interacting with acquaintances  which is better than interacting with parents  which is better than interacting with children. Who are on par with strangers.  But here's the thing. I have been looking at what underlies these data for three years  and children are not the problem. Something about parenting right now at this moment is the problem. Specifically  I don't think we know what parenting is supposed to be. Parent  as a verb  only entered common usage in     . Our roles as mothers and fathers have changed. The roles of our children have changed. We are all now furiously improvising our way through a situation for which there is no script  and if you're an amazing jazz musician  then improv is great  but for the rest of us  it can kind of feel like a crisis. So how did we get here  How is it that we are all now navigating a child rearing universe without any norms to guide us  Well  for starters  there has been a major historical change. Until fairly recently  kids worked  on our farms primarily  but also in factories  mills  mines. Kids were considered economic assets. Sometime during the Progressive Era  we put an end to this arrangement. We recognized kids had rights  we banned child labor  we focused on education instead  and school became a child's new work. And thank God it did. But that only made a parent's role more confusing in a way. The old arrangement might not have been particularly ethical  but it was reciprocal. We provided food  clothing  shelter  and moral instruction to our kids  and they in return provided income. Once kids stopped working  the economics of parenting changed. Kids became  in the words of one brilliant if totally ruthless sociologist   economically worthless but emotionally priceless.  Rather than them working for us  we began to work for them  because within only a matter of decades it became clear  if we wanted our kids to succeed  school was not enough. Today  extracurricular activities are a kid's new work  but that's work for us too  because we are the ones driving them to soccer practice. Massive piles of homework are a kid's new work  but that's also work for us  because we have to check it. About three years ago  a Texas woman told something to me that totally broke my heart. She said  almost casually   Homework is the new dinner.  The middle class now pours all of its time and energy and resources into its kids  even though the middle class has less and less of those things to give. Mothers now spend more time with their children than they did in       when most women were not even in the workforce. It would probably be easier for parents to do their new roles if they knew what they were preparing their kids for. This is yet another thing that makes modern parenting so very confounding. We have no clue what portion our wisdom  if any  is of use to our kids. The world is changing so rapidly  it's impossible to say. This was true even when I was young. When I was a kid  high school specifically  I was told that I would be at sea in the new global economy if I did not know Japanese. And with all due respect to the Japanese  it didn't turn out that way. Now there is a certain kind of middle class parent that is obsessed with teaching their kids Mandarin  and maybe they're onto something  but we cannot know for sure. So  absent being able to anticipate the future  what we all do  as good parents  is try and prepare our kids for every possible kind of future  hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off. We teach our kids chess  thinking maybe they will need analytical skills. We sign them up for team sports  thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills  you know  for when they go to Harvard Business School. We try and teach them to be financially savvy and science minded and eco friendly and gluten free  though now is probably a good time to tell you that I was not eco friendly and gluten free as a child. I ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef. And you know what  I'm doing okay. I pay my taxes. I hold down a steady job. I was even invited to speak at TED. But the presumption now is that what was good enough for me  or for my folks for that matter  isn't good enough anymore. So we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf  because we feel like if we aren't trying everything  it's as if we're doing nothing and we're defaulting on our obligations to our kids. So it's hard enough to navigate our new roles as mothers and fathers. Now add to this problem something else  we are also navigating new roles as husbands and wives because most women today are in the workforce. This is another reason  I think  that parenthood feels like a crisis. We have no rules  no scripts  no norms for what to do when a child comes along now that both mom and dad are breadwinners. The writer Michael Lewis once put this very  very well. He said that the surest way for a couple to start fighting is for them to go out to dinner with another couple whose division of labor is ever so slightly different from theirs  because the conversation in the car on the way home goes something like this   So  did you catch that Dave is the one who walks them to school every morning   Without scripts telling us who does what in this brave new world  couples fight  and both mothers and fathers each have their legitimate gripes. Mothers are much more likely to be multi tasking when they are at home  and fathers  when they are at home  are much more likely to be mono tasking. Find a guy at home  and odds are he is doing just one thing at a time. In fact  UCLA recently did a study looking at the most common configuration of family members in middle class homes. Guess what it was  Dad in a room by himself. According to the American Time Use Survey  mothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers  which is better than it was in Erma Bombeck's day  but I still think that something she wrote is highly relevant   I have not been alone in the bathroom since October.  But here is the thing  Men are doing plenty. They spend more time with their kids than their fathers ever spent with them. They work more paid hours  on average  than their wives  and they genuinely want to be good  involved dads. Today  it is fathers  not mothers  who report the most work life conflict. Either way  by the way  if you think it's hard for traditional families to sort out these new roles  just imagine what it's like now for non traditional families  families with two dads  families with two moms  single parent households. They are truly improvising as they go. Now  in a more progressive country  and forgive me here for capitulating to clich  and invoking  yes  Sweden  parents could rely on the state for support. There are countries that acknowledge the anxieties and the changing roles of mothers and fathers. Unfortunately  the United States is not one of them  so in case you were wondering what the U.S. has in common with Papua New Guinea and Liberia  it's this  We too have no paid maternity leave policy. We are one of eight known countries that does not. In this age of intense confusion  there is just one goal upon which all parents can agree  and that is whether they are tiger moms or hippie moms  helicopters or drones  our kids' happiness is paramount. That is what it means to raise kids in an age when they are economically worthless but emotionally priceless. We are all the custodians of their self esteem. The one mantra no parent ever questions is   All I want is for my children to be happy.  And don't get me wrong  I think happiness is a wonderful goal for a child. But it is a very elusive one. Happiness and self confidence  teaching children that is not like teaching them how to plow a field. It's not like teaching them how to ride a bike. There's no curriculum for it. Happiness and self confidence can be the byproducts of other things  but they cannot really be goals unto themselves. A child's happiness is a very unfair burden to place on a parent. And happiness is an even more unfair burden to place on a kid. And I have to tell you  I think it leads to some very strange excesses. We are now so anxious to protect our kids from the world's ugliness that we now shield them from  Sesame Street.  I wish I could say I was kidding about this  but if you go out and you buy the first few episodes of  Sesame Street  on DVD  as I did out of nostalgia  you will find a warning at the beginning saying that the content is not suitable for children. Can I just repeat that  The content of the original  Sesame Street  is not suitable for children. When asked about this by The New York Times  a producer for the show gave a variety of explanations. One was that Cookie Monster smoked a pipe in one skit and then swallowed it. Bad modeling. I don't know. But the thing that stuck with me is she said that she didn't know whether Oscar the Grouch could be invented today because he was too depressive. I cannot tell you how much this distresses me. You are looking at a woman who has a periodic table of the Muppets hanging from her cubicle wall. The offending muppet  right there. That's my son the day he was born. I was high as a kite on morphine. I had had an unexpected C section. But even in my opiate haze  I managed to have one very clear thought the first time I held him. I whispered it into his ear. I said   I will try so hard not to hurt you.  It was the Hippocratic Oath  and I didn't even know I was saying it. But it occurs to me now that the Hippocratic Oath is a much more realistic aim than happiness. In fact  as any parent will tell you  it's awfully hard. All of us have said or done hurtful things that we wish to God we could take back. I think in another era we did not expect quite so much from ourselves  and it is important that we all remember that the next time we are staring with our hearts racing at those bookshelves. I'm not really sure how to create new norms for this world  but I do think that in our desperate quest to create happy kids  we may be assuming the wrong moral burden. It strikes me as a better goal  and  dare I say  a more virtuous one  to focus on making productive kids and moral kids  and to simply hope that happiness will come to them by virtue of the good that they do and their accomplishments and the love that they feel from us. That  anyway  is one response to having no script. Absent having new scripts  we just follow the oldest ones in the book    decency  a work ethic  love   and let happiness and self esteem take care of themselves. I think if we all did that  the kids would still be all right  and so would their parents  possibly in both cases even better. Thank you. I want you all to think about the third word that was ever said about you    or  if you were delivering  about the person you were delivering. And you can all mouth it if you want or say it out loud. It was    the first two were   It's a ...  Audience   Mixed reply  Girl. Boy. Well  it shows you that    I also deal with issues where there's not certainty of whether it's a girl or a boy  so the mixed answer was very appropriate. Of course  now the answer often comes not at birth but at the ultrasound  unless the prospective parents choose to be surprised  like we all were. But I want you to think about what it is that leads to that statement on the third word  because the third word is a description of your sex. And by that I mean  made by a description of your genitals. Now  as a pediatric endocrinologist  I used to be very  very involved and still somewhat am  in cases in which there are mismatches in the externals or between the externals and the internals  and we literally have to figure out what is the description of your sex. But there is nothing that is definable at the time of birth that would define you. And when I talk about definition  I'm talking about your sexual orientation. We don't say   It's a ... gay boy    A lesbian girl   Those situations don't really define themselves more until the second decade of life. Nor do they define your gender  which  as different from your anatomic sex  describes your self concept  Do you see yourself as a male or female  or somewhere in the spectrum in between  That sometimes shows up in the first decade of life  but it can be very confusing for parents  because it is quite normative for children to act in a cross gender play and way  and  in fact  there are studies that show that even    percent of children who act in that fashion will not persist in wanting to be the opposite gender at the time when puberty begins. But  at the time that puberty begins    that means between about age    to    in girls     to    in boys    with breast budding  or two to three times' increase in the gonads in the case of genetic males  by that particular point  the child who says they are in the absolute wrong body is almost certain to be transgender and is extremely unlikely to change those feelings  no matter how anybody tries reparative therapy or any other noxious things. Now  this is relatively rare  so I had relatively little personal experience with this. And my experience was more typical  only because I had an adolescent practice. And I saw someone age     genetically female  went through Harvard with three male roommates who knew the whole story  a registrar who always listed his name on course lists as a male name  and came to me after graduating  saying   Help me. I know you know a lot of endocrinology.  And indeed  I've treated a lot of people who were born without gonads. This wasn't rocket science. But I made a deal with him   I'll treat you if you teach me.  And so he did. And what an education I got from taking care of all the members of his support group. And then I got really confused  because I thought it was relatively easy at that age to just give people the hormones of the gender in which they were affirming. But then my patient married  and he married a woman who had been born as a male  had married as a male  had two children  then went through a transition into female. And now this delightful female was attached to my male patient    in fact  got legally married  because they showed up as a man and a woman  and who knew  right  And I was confused     Does this make so and so gay  Does this make so and so straight   I was getting sexual orientation confused with gender identity. And my patient said to me   Look  look  look. If you just think of the following  you'll get it right  Sexual orientation is who you go to bed with. Gender identity is who you go to bed as.  And I subsequently learned from the many adults    I took care of about     adults    I learned from them that if I didn't peek as to who their partner was in the waiting room  I would never be able to guess better than chance  whether they were gay  straight  bi or asexual in their affirmed gender. In other words  one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other. And the data show it. Now  as I took care of the     adults  I found it extremely painful. These people    many of them    had to give up so much of their lives. Sometimes their parents would reject them  siblings  their own children  and then their divorcing spouse would forbid them from seeing their children. It was so awful  but why did they do it at    and     Because they felt they had to affirm themselves before they would kill themselves. And indeed  the rate of suicide among untreated transgendered people is among the highest in the world. So  what to do  I was intrigued  in going to a conference in Holland  where they are experts in this  and saw the most remarkable thing. They were treating young adolescents after giving them the most intense psychometric testing of gender  and they were treating them by blocking the puberty that they didn't want. Because basically  kids look about the same  each sex  until they go through puberty  at which point  if you feel you're in the wrong sex  you feel like Pinocchio becoming a donkey. The fantasy that you had that your body will change to be who you want it to be  with puberty  actually is nullified by the puberty you get. And they fall apart. So that's why putting the puberty on hold    why on hold  You can't just give them the opposite hormones that young. They'll end up stunted in growth  and you think you can have a meaningful conversation about the fertility effects of such treatment with a    year old girl  a    year old boy  So this buys time in the diagnostic process for four or five years  so that they can work it out. They can have more and more testing  they can live without feeling their bodies are running away from them. And then  in a program they call           around age    is when they give the blocking hormones  and then at age     with retesting  they re qualify to receive    now remember  the blocking hormones are reversible  but when you give the hormones of the opposite sex  you now start spouting breasts and facial hair and voice change  depending on what you're using  and those effects are permanent  or require surgery to remove  or electrolysis  and you can never really affect the voice. So this is serious  and this is         year old stuff. And then at     they're eligible for surgery. And while there's no good surgery for females to males genitally  the male to female surgery has fooled gynecologists. That's how good it can be. So I looked at how the patients were doing  and I looked at patients who just looked like everybody else  except they were pubertally delayed. But once they gave them the hormones consistent with the gender they affirm  they look beautiful. They look normal. They had normal heights. You would never be able to pick them out in a crowd. So at that point  I decided I'm going to do this. This is really where the pediatric endocrine realm comes in  because  in fact  if you're going to deal with it in kids aged    to     that's pediatric endocrinology. So I brought some kids in  and this now became the standard of care  and the  Boston  Children's Hospital was behind it. By my showing them the kids before and after  people who never got treated and people who wished to be treated  and pictures of the Dutch    they came to me and said   You've got to do something for these kids.  Well  where were these kids before  They were out there suffering  is where they were. So we started a program in     . It became the first program of its kind    but it's really of the Dutch kind    in North America. And since then  we have     patients. Did they come from Afghanistan  No.    percent of them came from within     miles of Boston. And some came from England. Jackie had been abused in the Midlands  in England. She's    years old there  she was living as a girl  but she was being beaten up. It was a horror show  they had to homeschool her. And the reason the British were coming was because they would not treat anybody with anything under age     which means they were consigning them to an adult body no matter what happened  even if they tested them well. Jackie  on top of it  was  by virtue of skeletal markings  destined to be six feet five. And yet  she had just begun a male puberty. Well  I did something a little bit innovative  because I do know hormones  and that estrogen is much more potent in closing epiphyses  the growth plates  and stopping growth  than testosterone is. So we blocked her testosterone with a blocking hormone  but we added estrogen  not at     but at   . And so here she is at     on the left. And on her   th birthday  she went to Thailand  where they would do a genital plastic surgery. They will do it at    now. And she ended up  '   . But more than that  she has normal breast size  because by blocking testosterone  every one of our patients has normal breast size if they get to us at the appropriate age  not too late. And on the far right  there she is. She went public    semifinalist in the Miss England competition. The judges debated as to  can they do this  And one of them quipped  I'm told   But she has more natural self than half the other contestants.  And some of them have been rearranged a little bit  but it's all her DNA. And she's become a remarkable spokeswoman. And she was offered contracts as a model  at which point she teased me  when she said   You know  I might have had a better chance as a model if you'd made me six feet one.  Go figure. So this picture  I think  says it all. It really says it all. These are Nicole and brother Jonas  identical twin boys  and proven to be identical. Nicole had affirmed herself as a girl as early as age three. At age seven  they changed her name  and came to me at the very beginnings of a male puberty. Now you can imagine looking at Jonas at only     that male puberty is early in this family  because he looks more like a    year old. But it makes the point all the more  of why you have to be conscious of where the patient is. Nicole is on pubertal blockade in here  and Jonas is just going    biologic control. This is what Nicole would look like if we weren't doing what we were doing. He's got a prominent Adam's apple. He's got angular bones to the face  a mustache  and you can see there's a height difference  because he's gone through a growth spurt that she won't get. Now Nicole is on estrogen. She has a bit of a form to her. This family went to the White House last spring  because of their work in overturning an anti discrimination    there was a bill that would block the right of transgender people in Maine to use public bathrooms  and it looked like the bill was going to pass  and that would have been a problem  but Nicole went personally to every legislator in Maine and said   I can do this. If they see me  they'll understand why I'm no threat in the ladies' room  but I can be threatened in the men's room.  And then they finally got it. So where do we go from here  Well  we still have a ways to go in terms of anti discrimination. There are only    states that have an anti discrimination law against discrimination in housing  employment  public accommodation    only    states  and five of them are in New England. We need less expensive drugs. They cost a fortune. And we need to get this condition out of the DSM. It is as much a psychiatric disease as being gay and lesbian  and that went out the window in       and the whole world changed. And this isn't going to break anybody's budget. This is not that common. But the risks of not doing anything for them not only puts all of them at risk of losing their lives to suicide  but it also says something about whether we are a truly inclusive society. Thank you. The universe is teeming with planets. I want us  in the next decade  to build a space telescope that'll be able to image an Earth about another star and figure out whether it can harbor life. My colleagues at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Princeton and I are working on technology that will be able to do just that in the coming years. Astronomers now believe that every star in the galaxy has a planet  and they speculate that up to one fifth of them have an Earth like planet that might be able to harbor life  but we haven't seen any of them. We've only detected them indirectly. This is NASA's famous picture of the pale blue dot. It was taken by the Voyager spacecraft in       when they turned it around as it was exiting the solar system to take a picture of the Earth from six billion kilometers away. I want to take that of an Earth like planet about another star. Why haven't we done that  Why is that hard  Well to see  let's imagine we take the Hubble Space Telescope and we turn it around and we move it out to the orbit of Mars. We'll see something like that  a slightly blurry picture of the Earth  because we're a fairly small telescope out at the orbit of Mars. Now let's move ten times further away. Here we are at the orbit of Uranus. It's gotten smaller  it's got less detail  less resolve. We can still see the little moon  but let's go ten times further away again. Here we are at the edge of the solar system  out at the Kuiper Belt. Now it's not resolved at all. It's that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan's. But let's move yet again ten times further away. Here we are out at the Oort Cloud  outside the solar system  and we're starting to see the sun move into the field of view and get into where the planet is. One more time  ten times further away. Now we're at Alpha Centauri  our nearest neighbor star  and the planet is gone. All we're seeing is the big beaming image of the star that's ten billion times brighter than the planet  which should be in that little red circle. That's what we want to see. That's why it's hard. The light from the star is diffracting. It's scattering inside the telescope  creating that very bright image that washes out the planet. So to see the planet  we have to do something about all of that light. We have to get rid of it. I have a lot of colleagues working on really amazing technologies to do that  but I want to tell you about one today that I think is the coolest  and probably the most likely to get us an Earth in the next decade. It was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer  the father of the space telescope  in       and he took his inspiration from an eclipse. You've all seen that. That's a solar eclipse. The moon has moved in front of the sun. It blocks out most of the light so we can see that dim corona around it. It would be the same thing if I put my thumb up and blocked that spotlight that's getting right in my eye  I can see you in the back row. Well  what's going on  Well the moon is casting a shadow down on the Earth. We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow  we look back at the sun  and most of the light's been removed and we can see that dim  fine structure in the corona. Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space. We build a big screen  we fly it in space  we put it up in front of the star  we block out most of the light  we fly a space telescope in that shadow that's created  and boom  we get to see planets. Well that would look something like this. So there's that big screen  and there's no planets  because unfortunately it doesn't actually work very well  because the light waves of the light and waves diffracts around that screen the same way it did in the telescope. It's like water bending around a rock in a stream  and all that light just destroys the shadow. It's a terrible shadow. And we can't see planets. But Spitzer actually knew the answer. If we can feather the edges  soften those edges so we can control diffraction  well then we can see a planet  and in the last    years or so we've come up with optimal solutions for doing that. It looks something like that. We call that our flower petal starshade. If we make the edges of those petals exactly right  if we control their shape  we can control diffraction  and now we have a great shadow. It's about    billion times dimmer than it was before  and we can see the planets beam out just like that. That  of course  has to be bigger than my thumb. That starshade is about the size of half a football field and it has to fly        kilometers away from the telescope that has to be held right in its shadow  and then we can see those planets. This sounds formidable  but brilliant engineers  colleagues of mine at JPL  came up with a fabulous design for how to do that and it looks like this. It starts wrapped around a hub. It separates from the telescope. The petals unfurl  they open up  the telescope turns around. Then you'll see it flip and fly out that        kilometers away from the telescope. It's going to move in front of the star just like that  creates a wonderful shadow. Boom  we get planets orbiting about it. Thank you. That's not science fiction. We've been working on this for the last five or six years. Last summer  we did a really cool test out in California at Northrop Grumman. So those are four petals. This is a sub scale star shade. It's about half the size of the one you just saw. You'll see the petals unfurl. Those four petals were built by four undergraduates doing a summer internship at JPL. Now you're seeing it deploy. Those petals have to rotate into place. The base of those petals has to go to the same place every time to within a tenth of a millimeter. We ran this test    times  and    times it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter. This has to be done very precisely  but if we can do this  if we can build this technology  if we can get it into space  you might see something like this. That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. If we can take a similar space telescope  slightly larger  put it out there  fly an occulter in front of it  what we might see is something like that    that's a family portrait of our solar system    but not ours. We're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system as seen through an occulter  through a starshade like that. You can see Jupiter  you can see Saturn  Uranus  Neptune  and right there in the center  next to the residual light is that pale blue dot. That's Earth. We want to see that  see if there's water  oxygen  ozone  the things that might tell us that it could harbor life. I think this is the coolest possible science. That's why I got into doing this  because I think that will change the world. That will change everything when we see that. Thank you. Type is something we consume in enormous quantities. In much of the world  it's completely inescapable. But few consumers are concerned to know where a particular typeface came from or when or who designed it  if  indeed  there was any human agency involved in its creation  if it didn't just sort of materialize out of the software ether. But I do have to be concerned with those things. It's my job. I'm one of the tiny handful of people who gets badly bent out of shape by the bad spacing of the T and the E that you see there. I've got to take that slide off. I can't stand it. Nor can Chris. There. Good. So my talk is about the connection between technology and design of type. The technology has changed a number of times since I started work  photo  digital  desktop  screen  web. I've had to survive those changes and try to understand their implications for what I do for design. This slide is about the effect of tools on form. The two letters  the two K's  the one on your left  my right  is modern  made on a computer. All straight lines are dead straight. The curves have that kind of mathematical smoothness that the B zier formula imposes. On the right  ancient Gothic  cut in the resistant material of steel by hand. None of the straight lines are actually straight. The curves are kind of subtle. It has that spark of life from the human hand that the machine or the program can never capture. What a contrast. Well  I tell a lie. A lie at TED. I'm really sorry. Both of these were made on a computer  same software  same B zier curves  same font format. The one on your left was made by Zuzana Licko at Emigre  and I did the other one. The tool is the same  yet the letters are different. The letters are different because the designers are different. That's all. Zuzana wanted hers to look like that. I wanted mine to look like that. End of story. Type is very adaptable. Unlike a fine art  such as sculpture or architecture  type hides its methods. I think of myself as an industrial designer. The thing I design is manufactured  and it has a function  to be read  to convey meaning. But there is a bit more to it than that. There's the sort of aesthetic element. What makes these two letters different from different interpretations by different designers  What gives the work of some designers sort of characteristic personal style  as you might find in the work of a fashion designer  an automobile designer  whatever  There have been some cases  I admit  where I as a designer did feel the influence of technology. This is from the mid '  s  the change from metal type to photo  hot to cold. This brought some benefits but also one particular drawback  a spacing system that only provided    discrete units for letters to be accommodated on. I was asked at this time to design a series of condensed sans serif types with as many different variants as possible within this    unit box. Quickly looking at the arithmetic  I realized I could only actually make three of related design. Here you see them. In Helvetica Compressed  Extra Compressed  and Ultra Compressed  this rigid    unit system really boxed me in. It kind of determined the proportions of the design. Here are the typefaces  at least the lower cases. So do you look at these and say   Poor Matthew  he had to submit to a problem  and by God it shows in the results.  I hope not. If I were doing this same job today  instead of having    spacing units  I would have      . Clearly I could make more variants  but would these three members of the family be better  It's hard to say without actually doing it  but they would not be better in the proportion of       to     I can tell you that. My instinct tells you that any improvement would be rather slight  because they were designed as functions of the system they were designed to fit  and as I said  type is very adaptable. It does hide its methods. All industrial designers work within constraints. This is not fine art. The question is  does a constraint force a compromise  By accepting a constraint  are you working to a lower standard  I don't believe so  and I've always been encouraged by something that Charles Eames said. He said he was conscious of working within constraints  but not of making compromises. The distinction between a constraint and a compromise is obviously very subtle  but it's very central to my attitude to work. Remember this reading experience  The phone book. I'll hold the slide so you can enjoy the nostalgia. This is from the mid '  s early trials of Bell Centennial typeface I designed for the U.S. phone books  and it was my first experience of digital type  and quite a baptism. Designed for the phone books  as I said  to be printed at tiny size on newsprint on very high speed rotary presses with ink that was kerosene and lampblack. This is not a hospitable environment for a typographic designer. So the challenge for me was to design type that performed as well as possible in these very adverse production conditions. As I say  we were in the infancy of digital type. I had to draw every character by hand on quadrille graph paper    there were four weights of Bell Centennial   pixel by pixel  then encode them raster line by raster line for the keyboard. It took two years  but I learned a lot. These letters look as though they've been chewed by the dog or something or other  but the missing pixels at the intersections of strokes or in the crotches are the result of my studying the effects of ink spread on cheap paper and reacting  revising the font accordingly. These strange artifacts are designed to compensate for the undesirable effects of scale and production process. At the outset  AT T had wanted to set the phone books in Helvetica  but as my friend Erik Spiekermann said in the Helvetica movie  if you've seen that  the letters in Helvetica were designed to be as similar to one another as possible. This is not the recipe for legibility at small size. It looks very elegant up on a slide. I had to disambiguate these forms of the figures as much as possible in Bell Centennial by sort of opening the shapes up  as you can see in the bottom part of that slide. So now we're on to the mid '  s  the early days of digital outline fonts  vector technology. There was an issue at that time with the size of the fonts  the amount of data that was required to find and store a font in computer memory. It limited the number of fonts you could get on your typesetting system at any one time. I did an analysis of the data  and found that a typical serif face you see on the left needed nearly twice as much data as a sans serif in the middle because of all the points required to define the elegantly curved serif brackets. The numbers at the bottom of the slide  by the way  they represent the amount of data needed to store each of the fonts. So the sans serif  in the middle  sans the serifs  was much more economical     to    .  Aha   I thought.  The engineers have a problem. Designer to the rescue.  I made a serif type  you can see it on the right  without curved serifs. I made them polygonal  out of straight line segments  chamfered brackets. And look  as economical in data as a sans serif. We call it Charter  on the right. So I went to the head of engineering with my numbers  and I said proudly   I have solved your problem.   Oh   he said.  What problem   And I said   Well  you know  the problem of the huge data you require for serif fonts and so on.   Oh   he said.  We solved that problem last week. We wrote a compaction routine that reduces the size of all fonts by an order of magnitude. You can have as many fonts on your system as you like.   Well  thank you for letting me know   I said. Foiled again. I was left with a design solution for a nonexistent technical problem. But here is where the story sort of gets interesting for me. I didn't just throw my design away in a fit of pique. I persevered. What had started as a technical exercise became an aesthetic exercise  really. In other words  I had come to like this typeface. Forget its origins. Screw that. I liked the design for its own sake. The simplified forms of Charter gave it a sort of plain spoken quality and unfussy spareness that sort of pleased me. You know  at times of technical innovation  designers want to be influenced by what's in the air. We want to respond. We want to be pushed into exploring something new. So Charter is a sort of parable for me  really. In the end  there was no hard and fast causal link between the technology and the design of Charter. I had really misunderstood the technology. The technology did suggest something to me  but it did not force my hand  and I think this happens very often. You know  engineers are very smart  and despite occasional frustrations because I'm less smart  I've always enjoyed working with them and learning from them. Apropos  in the mid '  s  I started talking to Microsoft about screen fonts. Up to that point  all the fonts on screen had been adapted from previously existing printing fonts  of course. But Microsoft foresaw correctly the movement  the stampede towards electronic communication  to reading and writing onscreen with the printed output as being sort of secondary in importance. So the priorities were just tipping at that point. They wanted a small core set of fonts that were not adapted but designed for the screen to face up to the problems of screen  which were their coarse resolution displays. I said to Microsoft  a typeface designed for a particular technology is a self obsoleting typeface. I've designed too many faces in the past that were intended to mitigate technical problems. Thanks to the engineers  the technical problems went away. So did my typeface. It was only a stopgap. Microsoft came back to say that affordable computer monitors with better resolutions were at least a decade away. So I thought  well  a decade  that's not bad  that's more than a stopgap. So I was persuaded  I was convinced  and we went to work on what became Verdana and Georgia  for the first time working not on paper but directly onto the screen from the pixel up. At that time  screens were binary. The pixel was either on or it was off. Here you see the outline of a letter  the cap H  which is the thin black line  the contour  which is how it is stored in memory  superimposed on the bitmap  which is the grey area  which is how it's displayed on the screen. The bitmap is rasterized from the outline. Here in a cap H  which is all straight lines  the two are in almost perfect sync on the Cartesian grid. Not so with an O. This looks more like bricklaying than type design  but believe me  this is a good bitmap O  for the simple reason that it's symmetrical in both x and y axes. In a binary bitmap  you actually can't ask for more than that. I would sometimes make  I don't know  three or four different versions of a difficult letter like a lowercase A  and then stand back to choose which was the best. Well  there was no best  so the designer's judgment comes in in trying to decide which is the least bad. Is that a compromise  Not to me  if you are working at the highest standard the technology will allow  although that standard may be well short of the ideal. You may be able to see on this slide two different bitmap fonts there. The  a  in the upper one  I think  is better than the  a  in the lower one  but it still ain't great. You can maybe see the effect better if it's reduced. Well  maybe not. So I'm a pragmatist  not an idealist  out of necessity. For a certain kind of temperament  there is a certain kind of satisfaction in doing something that cannot be perfect but can still be done to the best of your ability. Here's the lowercase H from Georgia Italic. The bitmap looks jagged and rough. It is jagged and rough. But I discovered  by experiment  that there is an optimum slant for an italic on a screen so the strokes break well at the pixel boundaries. Look in this example how  rough as it is  how the left and right legs actually break at the same level. That's a victory. That's good  right there. And of course  at the lower depths  you don't get much choice. This is an S  in case you were wondering. Well  it's been    years now since Verdana and Georgia were released. Microsoft were absolutely right  it took a good    years  but screen displays now do have improved spatial resolution  and very much improved photometric resolution thanks to anti aliasing and so on. So now that their mission is accomplished  has that meant the demise of the screen fonts that I designed for coarser displays back then  Will they outlive the now obsolete screens and the flood of new web fonts coming on to the market  Or have they established their own sort of evolutionary niche that is independent of technology  In other words  have they been absorbed into the typographic mainstream  I'm not sure  but they've had a good run so far. Hey     is a good age for anything with present day rates of attrition  so I'm not complaining. Thank you. I feel so fortunate that my first job was working at the Museum of Modern Art on a retrospective of painter Elizabeth Murray. I learned so much from her. After the curator Robert Storr selected all the paintings from her lifetime body of work  I loved looking at the paintings from the     s. There were some motifs and elements that would come up again later in her life. I remember asking her what she thought of those early works. If you didn't know they were hers  you might not have been able to guess. She told me that a few didn't quite meet her own mark for what she wanted them to be. One of the works  in fact  so didn't meet her mark  she had set it out in the trash in her studio  and her neighbor had taken it because she saw its value. In that moment  my view of success and creativity changed. I realized that success is a moment  but what we're always celebrating is creativity and mastery. But this is the thing  What gets us to convert success into mastery  This is a question I've long asked myself. I think it comes when we start to value the gift of a near win. I started to understand this when I went on one cold May day to watch a set of varsity archers  all women as fate would have it  at the northern tip of Manhattan at Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex. I wanted to see what's called archer's paradox  the idea that in order to actually hit your target  you have to aim at something slightly skew from it. I stood and watched as the coach drove up these women in this gray van  and they exited with this kind of relaxed focus. One held a half eaten ice cream cone in one hand and arrows in the left with yellow fletching. And they passed me and smiled  but they sized me up as they made their way to the turf  and spoke to each other not with words but with numbers  degrees  I thought  positions for how they might plan to hit their target. I stood behind one archer as her coach stood in between us to maybe assess who might need support  and watched her  and I didn't understand how even one was going to hit the ten ring. The ten ring from the standard    yard distance  it looks as small as a matchstick tip held out at arm's length. And this is while holding    pounds of draw weight on each shot. She first hit a seven  I remember  and then a nine  and then two tens  and then the next arrow didn't even hit the target. And I saw that gave her more tenacity  and she went after it again and again. For three hours this went on. At the end of the practice  one of the archers was so taxed that she lied out on the ground just star fished  her head looking up at the sky  trying to find what T.S. Eliot might call that still point of the turning world. It's so rare in American culture  there's so little that's vocational about it anymore  to look at what doggedness looks like with this level of exactitude  what it means to align your body posture for three hours in order to hit a target  pursuing a kind of excellence in obscurity. But I stayed because I realized I was witnessing what's so rare to glimpse  that difference between success and mastery. So success is hitting that ten ring  but mastery is knowing that it means nothing if you can't do it again and again. Mastery is not just the same as excellence  though. It's not the same as success  which I see as an event  a moment in time  and a label that the world confers upon you. Mastery is not a commitment to a goal but to a constant pursuit. What gets us to do this  what get us to forward thrust more is to value the near win. How many times have we designated something a classic  a masterpiece even  while its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished  riddled with difficulties and flaws  in other words  a near win  Elizabeth Murray surprised me with her admission about her earlier paintings. Painter Paul C zanne so often thought his works were incomplete that he would deliberately leave them aside with the intention of picking them back up again  but at the end of his life  the result was that he had only signed    percent of his paintings. His favorite novel was  The  Unknown  Masterpiece  by Honor  de Balzac  and he felt the protagonist was the painter himself. Franz Kafka saw incompletion when others would find only works to praise  so much so that he wanted all of his diaries  manuscripts  letters and even sketches burned upon his death. His friend refused to honor the request  and because of that  we now have all the works we now do by Kafka   America    The Trial  and  The Castle   a work so incomplete it even stops mid sentence. The pursuit of mastery  in other words  is an ever onward almost.  Lord  grant that I desire more than I can accomplish   Michelangelo implored  as if to that Old Testament God on the Sistine Chapel  and he himself was that Adam with his finger outstretched and not quite touching that God's hand. Mastery is in the reaching  not the arriving. It's in constantly wanting to close that gap between where you are and where you want to be. Mastery is about sacrificing for your craft and not for the sake of crafting your career. How many inventors and untold entrepreneurs live out this phenomenon  We see it even in the life of the indomitable Arctic explorer Ben Saunders  who tells me that his triumphs are not merely the result of a grand achievement  but of the propulsion of a lineage of near wins. We thrive when we stay at our own leading edge. It's a wisdom understood by Duke Ellington  who said that his favorite song out of his repertoire was always the next one  always the one he had yet to compose. Part of the reason that the near win is inbuilt to mastery is because the greater our proficiency  the more clearly we might see that we don't know all that we thought we did. It's called the Dunning Kruger effect. The Paris Review got it out of James Baldwin when they asked him   What do you think increases with knowledge   and he said   You learn how little you know.  Success motivates us  but a near win can propel us in an ongoing quest. One of the most vivid examples of this comes when we look at the difference between Olympic silver medalists and bronze medalists after a competition. Thomas Gilovich and his team from Cornell studied this difference and found that the frustration silver medalists feel compared to bronze  who are typically a bit more happy to have just not received fourth place and not medaled at all  gives silver medalists a focus on follow up competition. We see it even in the gambling industry that once picked up on this phenomenon of the near win and created these scratch off tickets that had a higher than average rate of near wins and so compelled people to buy more tickets that they were called heart stoppers  and were set on a gambling industry set of abuses in Britain in the     s. The reason the near win has a propulsion is because it changes our view of the landscape and puts our goals  which we tend to put at a distance  into more proximate vicinity to where we stand. If I ask you to envision what a great day looks like next week  you might describe it in more general terms. But if I ask you to describe a great day at TED tomorrow  you might describe it with granular  practical clarity. And this is what a near win does. It gets us to focus on what  right now  we plan to do to address that mountain in our sights. It's Jackie Joyner Kersee  who in      missed taking the gold in the heptathlon by one third of a second  and her husband predicted that would give her the tenacity she needed in follow up competition. In       she won the gold in the heptathlon and set a record of       points  a score that no athlete has come very close to since. We thrive not when we've done it all  but when we still have more to do. I stand here thinking and wondering about all the different ways that we might even manufacture a near win in this room  how your lives might play this out  because I think on some gut level we do know this. We know that we thrive when we stay at our own leading edge  and it's why the deliberate incomplete is inbuilt into creation myths. In Navajo culture  some craftsmen and women would deliberately put an imperfection in textiles and ceramics. It's what's called a spirit line  a deliberate flaw in the pattern to give the weaver or maker a way out  but also a reason to continue making work. Masters are not experts because they take a subject to its conceptual end. They're masters because they realize that there isn't one. Now it occurred to me  as I thought about this  why the archery coach told me at the end of that practice  out of earshot of his archers  that he and his colleagues never feel they can do enough for their team  never feel there are enough visualization techniques and posture drills to help them overcome those constant near wins. It didn't sound like a complaint  exactly  but just a way to let me know  a kind of tender admission  to remind me that he knew he was giving himself over to a voracious  unfinished path that always required more. We build out of the unfinished idea  even if that idea is our former self. This is the dynamic of mastery. Coming close to what you thought you wanted can help you attain more than you ever dreamed you could. It's what I have to imagine Elizabeth Murray was thinking when I saw her smiling at those early paintings one day in the galleries. Even if we created utopias  I believe we would still have the incomplete. Completion is a goal  but we hope it is never the end. Thank you. Wow  this is bright. It must use a lot of power. Well  flying you all in here must have cost a bit of energy too. So the whole planet needs a lot of energy  and so far we've been running mostly on fossil fuel. We've been burning gas. It's been a good run. It got us to where we are  but we have to stop. We can't do that anymore. So we are trying different types of energy now  alternative energy  but it proved quite difficult to find something that's as convenient and as cost effective as oil  gas and coal. My personal favorite is nuclear energy. Now  it's very energy dense  it produces solid  reliable power  and it doesn't make any CO . Now we know of two ways of making nuclear energy  fission and fusion. Now in fission  you take a big nucleus  you break it in part  in two  and it makes lots of energy  and this is how the nuclear reactor today works. It works pretty good. And then there's fusion. Now  I like fusion. Fusion's much better. So you take two small nuclei  you put it together  and you make helium  and that's very nice. It makes lots of energy. This is nature's way of producing energy. The sun and all the stars in the universe run on fusion. Now  a fusion plant would actually be quite cost effective and it also would be quite safe. It only produces short term radioactive waste  and it cannot melt down. Now  the fuel from fusion comes from the ocean. In the ocean  you can extract the fuel for about one thousandth of a cent per kilowatt hour  so that's very  very cheap. And if the whole planet would run on fusion  we could extract the fuel from the ocean. It would run for billions and billions of years. Now  if fusion is so great  why don't we have it  Where is it  Well  there's always a bit of a catch. Fusion is really  really hard to do. So the problem is  those two nuclei  they are both positively charged  so they don't want to fuse. They go like this. They go like that. So in order to make them fuse  you have to throw them at each other with great speed  and if they have enough speed  they will go against the repulsion  they will touch  and they will make energy. Now  the particle speed is a measure of the temperature. So the temperature required for fusion is     billion degrees C. This is rather warm  and this is why fusion is so hard to do. Now  I caught my little fusion bug when I did my Ph.D. here at the University of British Columbia  and then I got a big job in a laser printer place making printing for the printing industry. I worked there for    years  and I got a little bit bored  and then I was     and I got a mid life crisis  you know  the usual thing  Who am I  What should I do  What should I do  What can I do  And then I was looking at my good work  and what I was doing is I was cutting the forests around here in B.C. and burying you  all of you  in millions of tons of junk mail. Now  that was not very satisfactory. So some people buy a Porsche. Others get a mistress. But I've decided to get my bit to solve global warming and make fusion happen. Now  so the first thing I did is I looked into the literature and I see  how does fusion work  So the physicists have been working on fusion for a while  and one of the ways they do it is with something called a tokamak. It's a big ring of magnetic coil  superconducting coil  and it makes a magnetic field in a ring like this  and the hot gas in the middle  which is called a plasma  is trapped. The particles go round and round and round the circle at the wall. Then they throw a huge amount of heat in there to try to cook that to fusion temperature. So this is the inside of one of those donuts  and on the right side you can see the fusion plasma in there. Now  a second way of doing this is by using laser fusion. Now in laser fusion  you have a little ping pong ball  you put the fusion fuel in the center  and you zap that with a whole bunch of laser around it. The lasers are very strong  and it squashes the ping pong ball really  really quick. And if you squeeze something hard enough  it gets hotter  and if it gets really  really fast  and they do that in one billionth of a second  it makes enough energy and enough heat to make fusion. So this is the inside of one such machine. You see the laser beam and the pellet in the center. Now  most people think that fusion is going nowhere. They always think that the physicists are in their lab and they're working hard  but nothing is happening. That's actually not quite true. This is a curve of the gain in fusion over the last    years or so  and you can see that we're making now about        times more fusion than we used to when we started. That's a pretty good gain. As a matter of fact  it's as fast as the fabled Moore's Law that defined the amount of transistors they can put on a chip. Now  this dot here is called JET  the Joint European Torus. It's a big tokamak donut in Europe  and this machine in      produced    megawatts of fusion power with    megawatts of heat. Now  you say  that's not much use  but it's actually pretty close  considering we can get about        times more than we started. The second dot here is the NIF. It's the National Ignition Facility. It's a big laser machine in the U.S.  and last month they announced with quite a bit of noise that they had managed to make more fusion energy from the fusion than the energy that they put in  the center of the ping pong ball. Now  that's not quite good enough  because the laser to put that energy in was more energy than that  but it was pretty good. Now this is ITER  pronounced in French  EE tairh. So this is a big collaboration of different countries that are building a huge magnetic donut in the south of France  and this machine  when it's finished  will produce     megawatts of fusion power with only    megawatts to make it. So this one is the real one. It's going to work. That's the kind of machine that makes energy. Now if you look at the graph  you will notice that those two dots are a little bit on the right of the curve. We kind of have fallen off the progress. Actually  the science to make those machines was really in time to produce fusion during that curve. However  there has been a bit of politics going on  and the will to do it was not there  so it drifted to the right. ITER  for example  could have been built in      or       but because it's a big international collaboration  the politics got in and it delayed it a bit. For example  it took them about three years to decide where to put it. Now  fusion is often criticized for being a little too expensive. Yes  it did cost a billion dollars or two billion dollars a year to make this progress. But you have to compare that to the cost of making Moore's Law. That cost way more than that. The result of Moore's Law is this cell phone here in my pocket. This cell phone  and the Internet behind it  cost about one trillion dollars  just so I can take a selfie and put it on Facebook. Then when my dad sees that  he'll be very proud. We also spend about     billion dollars a year in subsidies for oil and gas and renewable energy. Now  we spend one half of a percent of that on fusion. So me  personally  I don't think it's too expensive. I think it's actually been shortchanged  considering it can solve all our energy problems cleanly for the next couple of billions of years. Now I can say that  but I'm a little bit biased  because I started a fusion company and I don't even have a Facebook account. So when I started this fusion company in       I knew I couldn't fight with the big lads. They had much more resources than me. So I decided I would need to find a solution that is cheaper and faster. Now magnetic and laser fusion are pretty good machines. They are awesome pieces of technology  wonderful machines  and they have shown that fusion can be done. However  as a power plant  I don't think they're very good. They're way too big  way too complicated  way too expensive  and also  they don't deal very much with the fusion energy. When you make fusion  the energy comes out as neutrons  fast neutrons comes out of the plasma. Those neutrons hit the wall of the machine. It damages it. And also  you have to catch the heat from those neutrons and run some steam to spin a turbine somewhere  and on those machines  it was all a bit of an afterthought. So I decided that surely there is a better way of doing that. So back to the literature  and I read about the fusion everywhere. One way in particular attracted my attention  and it's called magnetized target fusion  or MTF for short. Now  in MTF  what you want to do is you take a big vat and you fill that with liquid metal  and you spin the liquid metal to open a vortex in the center  a bit like your sink. When you pull the plug on a sink  it makes a vortex. And then you have some pistons driven by pressure that goes on the outside  and this compresses the liquid metal around the plasma  and it compresses it  it gets hotter  like a laser  and then it makes fusion. So it's a bit of a mix between a magnetized fusion and the laser fusion. So those have a couple of very good advantages. The liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons and no neutrons hit the wall  and therefore there's no damage to the machine. The liquid metal gets hot  so you can pump that in a heat exchanger  make some steam  spin a turbine. So that's a very convenient way of doing this part of the process. And finally  all the energy to make the fusion happen comes from steam powered pistons  which is way cheaper than lasers or superconducting coils. Now  this was all very good except for the problem that it didn't quite work. There's always a catch. So when you compress that  the plasma cools down faster than the compression speed  so you're trying to compress it  but the plasma cooled down and cooled down and cooled down and then it did absolutely nothing. So when I saw that  I said  well  this is such a shame  because it's a very  very good idea. So hopefully I can improve on that. So I thought about it for a minute  and I said  okay  how can we make that work better  So then I thought about impact. What about if we use a big hammer and we swing it and we hit the nail like this  in the place of putting the hammer on the nail and pushing and try to put it in  That won't work. So what the idea is is to use the idea of an impact. So we accelerate the pistons with steam  that takes a little bit of time  but then  bang  you hit the piston  and  baff   all the energy is done instantly  down instantly to the liquid  and that compresses the plasma much faster. So I decided  okay  this is good  let's make that. So we built this machine in this garage here. We made a small machine that we managed to squeeze a little bit of neutrons out of that  and those are my marketing neutrons  and with those marketing neutrons  then I raised about    million dollars  and I hired    people. That's my team here. And this is what we want to build. So it's going to be a big machine  about three meters in diameter  liquid lead spinning around  big vortex in the center  put the plasma on the top and on the bottom  piston hits on the side  bang   it compresses it  and it will make some energy  and the neutron will come out in the liquid metal  going to go in a steam engine and make the turbine  and some of the steam will go back to fire the piston. We're going to run that about one time per second  and it will produce     megawatts of electricity. Okay  we also built this injector  so this injector makes the plasma to start with. It makes the plasma at about a lukewarm temperature of three million degrees C. Unfortunately  it doesn't last quite long enough  so we need to extend the life of the plasma a little bit  but last month it got a lot better  so I think we have the plasma compressing now. Then we built a small sphere  about this big     pistons around it  and this will compress the liquid. However  plasma is difficult to compress. When you compress it  it tends to go a little bit crooked like that  so you need the timing of the piston to be very good  and for that we use several control systems  which was not possible in       but we now can do that with nice  new electronics. So finally  most people think that fusion is in the future and will never happen  but as a matter of fact  fusion is getting very close. We are almost there. The big labs have shown that fusion is doable  and now there are small companies that are thinking about that  and they say  it's not that it cannot be done  but it's how to make it cost effectively. General Fusion is one of those small companies  and hopefully  very soon  somebody  someone  will crack that nut  and perhaps it will be General Fusion. Thank you very much. Scientific breakthrough  the kind that can potentially save lives  can sometimes be lying right out in the open for us to discover  in the evolved  accumulated body of human anecdote  for example  or in the time tested adaptations that we observe in the natural world around us. Science starts with observation  but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures that we might otherwise dismiss as myth or coincidence  isolate them  and test them with scientific rigor. And when we do  the results will often surprise. Western Australia has had a particular problem with shark attacks over the last three years  unfortunately and tragically culminating in five fatal shark attacks in a    month period during that time. But Western Australia is not alone in this. The incident of shark engagements on humans is escalating worldwide. And so it's not surprising  perhaps  that in July of this year  Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration with the University of Western Australia Oceans Institute made an announcement which captured the attention of the worldwide media and of ocean users worldwide  and that was around the development of technology to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can see. And I have for you today the story of that journey  but also the notion that science can be as powerful as a translator as it can be for invention. When we began this process  we were looking  it was about three years ago  and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks in Western Australia  and by chance  in a previous role  I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler. Now Harry Butler  who most Australians would know is a famous naturalist  had spent a lot of time in the marine environment. Harry Butler is a precursor  if you like  to the late Steve Irwin. When I asked him about what the solution to the problem might be  the answer was quite surprising. He said   Take a black wetsuit  band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee  and you'll be mimicking the warning systems of most marine species.  I didn't think about that much at the time  and it wasn't until the next three fatal shark attacks happened  and it caused me to think  maybe there's some merit to this idea. And I turned to the web to see if there might be some clues. And it turns out the web is awash with this sort of evidence that supports this sort of thinking. So biologically  there are plenty of species that display banding or patterns  warning patterns  to either be cryptical in the water or warn against being attacked  not the least of which is the pilot fish which spends a big slab of its life around the business end of a shark. On the human side  Walter Starck  an oceanographer  has been painting his wetsuit since the     s  and anthropologically  Pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands in a sea snake ceremony to ward off the shark god. So what's going on here  Is this an idea lying wide out in the open for us to consider and define  We know that sharks use a range of sensors when they engage  particularly for attack  but the sight sensor is the one that they use to identify the target  and particularly in the last number of meters before the attack. It makes sense to pay attention to the biological anecdote because that's time tested evolution over many millennia. But isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts  the idea that there's a kernel of truth thought to be important  passed down from generation to generation  so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior  I wanted to test this idea. I wanted to put some science to this anecdotal evidence  because if science could support this concept  then we might have at least part of the solution to shark attack right under our very nose. To do that  I needed some experts in shark vision and shark neurology  and a worldwide search  again  led to the University of W.A. on the doorstep here  with the Oceans Institute. And professor Nathan Hart and his team had just written a paper which tells us  confirms that predatory sharks see in black and white  or grayscale. So I called up Nathan  a little bit sheepishly  actually  about this idea that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes to produce a wetsuit to try and mitigate the risk of shark attack  and fortunately  he thought that was a good idea. So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research supported by the West Australian State Government. And we did three key things. The first is that we mapped the characteristics  the physical characteristics of the eyes of the three main predatory sharks  so the great white  tiger and bull shark. We did that genetically and we did that anatomically. The next thing we did was to understand  using complex computer modeling  what that eye can see at different depths  distances  light conditions  and water clarity in the ocean. And from there  we were able to pinpoint two key characteristics  what patterns and shapes would present the wearer as hidden or hard to make out in the water  cryptic  and what patterns and shapes might provide the greatest contrast but provide the greatest breakup of profile so that that person wasn't confused for shark prey or shark food. The next thing we needed to do was to convert this into wetsuits that people might actually wear  and to that end  I invited Ray Smith  a surfer  industrial designer  wetsuit designer  and in fact the guy that designed the original Quiksilver logo  to come over and sit with the science team and interpret that science into aesthetic wetsuits that people might actually wear. And here's an example of one of the first drawings. So this is what I call a  don't eat me  wetsuit. So this takes that banding idea  takes that banding idea  it's highly visible  provides a highly disruptive profile  and is intended to prevent the shark from considering that you would be ordinary food  and potentially even create confusion for the shark. And this one's configured to go with a surfboard. You can see that dark  opaque panel on the front  and it's particularly better for the surface  where being backlit and providing a silhouette is problematic. Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit  or the one which attempts to hide the wearer in the water column. There are three panels on this suit  and in any given conditions  one or more of those panels will match the reflective spectra of the water so as to disappear fully or partially  leaving the last panel or panels to create a disruptive profile in the water column. And this one's particularly well suited to the dive configuration  so when you're deeper under the water. So we knew that we had some really solid science here. We knew  if you wanted to stand out  you needed to look stripy  and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic  you needed to look like this. But the acid test is always going to be  how would sharks really behave in the context of these patterns and shapes. And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit in the water with a predatory shark in a natural environment is actually a lot harder than you might think. So we have to bait the rig  because we need to get the statistical number of samples through to get the scientific evidence  and by baiting the rig  we're obviously changing shark behavior. We can't put humans in the water. We're ethically precluded from even using humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water. But nevertheless  we started the testing process in January of this year  initially with tiger sharks and subsequently with great white sharks. The way we did that was to get a perforated drum which is full of bait  wrap it in a neoprene skin  and then run two stereo underwater cameras to watch how the shark actually engages with that rig. And because we use stereo  we can capture all the statistics on how big the shark is  what angle it comes in at  how quickly it leaves  and what its behavior is in an empirical rather than a subjective way. Because we needed to preserve the scientific method  we ran a control rig which was a black neoprene rig just like a normal black wetsuit against the  what we call  SAMS technology rig. And the results were not just exciting  but very encouraging  and today I would like to just give you a snapshot of two of those engagements. So here we've got a four meter tiger shark engaging the black control rig  which it had encountered about a minute and a half before. Now that exact same shark had engaged  or encountered this SAMS rig  which is the Elude SAMS rig  about eight minutes before  and spent six minutes circling it  hunting for it  looking for what it could smell and sense but not see  and this was the final engagement. Great white sharks are more confident than the tigers  and here you see great white shark engaging a control rig  so a black neoprene wetsuit  and going straight to the bottom  coming up and engaging. In contrast to the SAMS technology rig  this is the banded one  where it's more tactile  it's more investigative  it's more apprehensive  and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go. So  it's important for us that all  the testing is done independently  and the University of W.A. is doing the testing. It'll be an ongoing process. It's subject to peer review and subject to publication. It's so important that this concept is led with the science. From the perspective of Shark  Attack Mitigation Systems  we're a biotechnology licensing company  so we don't make wetsuits ourselves. We'll license others to do that. But I thought you might be interested in seeing what SAMS technology looks like embedded in a wetsuit  and to that end  for the first time  live  worldwide    I can show you what biological adaptation  science and design looks like in real life. So I can welcome Sam  the surfer  from this side. Where are you  Sam  And Eduardo. Cheers  mate. Cheers. Thanks  gentlemen.  Applause  So what have we done here  Well  to my mind  rather than take a blank sheet and use science as a tool for invention  we've paid attention to the biological evidence  we've put importance to the human anecdotal evidence  and we've used science as a tool for translation  translation of something that was already there into something that we can  use for the benefit of mankind. And it strikes me that this idea of science as a tool for translation rather than invention is one that we can apply much more widely than this in the pursuit of innovation. After all  did the Wright brothers discover manned flight  or did they observe the biological fact of flight and translate that mechanically  replicate it in a way that humans could use  As for the humble wetsuit  who knows what oceanwear will look like in two years' time  in five years' time or in    years' time  but with this new thinking  I'm guessing there's a fair chance it won't be pure black. Thank you. A computer is an incredibly powerful means of creative expression  but for the most part  that expression is confined to the screens of our laptops and mobile phones. And I'd like to tell you a story about bringing this power of the computer to move things around and interact with us off of the screen and into the physical world in which we live. A few years ago  I got a call from a luxury fashion store called Barneys New York  and the next thing I knew  I was designing storefront kinetic sculptures for their window displays. This one's called  The Chase.  There are two pairs of shoes  a man's pair and a woman's pair  and they play out this slow  tense chase around the window in which the man scoots up behind the woman and gets in her personal space  and then she moves away. Each of the shoes has magnets in it  and there are magnets underneath the table that move the shoes around. My friend Andy Cavatorta was building a robotic harp for Bjork's Biophilia tour and I wound up building the electronics and motion control software to make the harps move and play music. The harp has four separate pendulums  and each pendulum has    strings  so the harp swings on its axis and also rotates in order to play different musical notes  and the harps are all networked together so that they can play the right notes at the right time in the music. I built an interactive chemistry exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago  and this exhibit lets people use physical objects to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table and bring them together to cause chemical reactions to happen. And the museum noticed that people were spending a lot of time with this exhibit  and a researcher from a science education center in Australia decided to study this exhibit and try to figure out what was going on. And she found that the physical objects that people were using were helping people understand how to use the exhibit  and were helping people learn in a social way. And when you think about it  this makes a lot of sense  that using specialized physical objects would help people use an interface more easily. I mean  our hands and our minds are optimized to think about and interact with tangible objects. Think about which you find easier to use  a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard like on a phone  But the thing that struck me about all of these different projects is that they really had to be built from scratch  down to the level of the electronics and the printed circuit boards and all the mechanisms all the way up to the software. I wanted to create something where we could move objects under computer control and create interactions around that idea without having to go through this process of building something from scratch every single time. So my first attempt at this was at the MIT Media Lab with Professor Hiroshi Ishii  and we built this array of     different electromagnets  and together they were able to move objects around on top of their surface. But the problem with this was that these magnets cost over        dollars. Although each one was pretty small  altogether they weighed so much that the table that they were on started to sag. So I wanted to build something where you could have this kind of interaction on any tabletop surface. So to explore this idea  I built an army of small robots  and each of these robots has what are called omni wheels. They're these special wheels that can move equally easily in all directions  and when you couple these robots with a video projector  you have these physical tools for interacting with digital information. So here's an example of what I mean. This is a video editing application where all of the controls for manipulating the video are physical. So if we want to tweak the color  we just enter the color mode  and then we get three different dials for tweaking the color  or if we want to adjust the audio  then we get two different dials for that  these physical objects. So here the left and right channel stay in sync  but if we want to  we can override that by grabbing both of them at the same time. So the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and versatility of a system that's designed in software. And this is a mapping application for disaster response. So you have these physical objects that represent police  fire and rescue  and a dispatcher can grab them and place them on the map to tell those units where to go  and then the position of the units on the map gets synced up with the position of those units in the real world. This is a video chat application. It's amazing how much emotion you can convey with just a few simple movements of a physical object. With this interface  we open up a huge array of possibilities in between traditional board games and arcade games  where the physical possibilities of interaction make so many different styles of play possible. But one of the areas that I'm most excited about using this platform for is applying it to problems that are difficult for computers or people to solve alone. One example of those is protein folding. So here we have an interface where we have physical handles onto a protein  and we can grab those handles and try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways. And if we move it in a way that doesn't really make sense with the underlying molecular simulation  we get this physical feedback where we can actually feel these physical handles pulling back against us. So feeling what's going on inside a molecular simulation is a whole different level of interaction. So we're just beginning to explore what's possible when we use software to control the movement of objects in our environment. Maybe this is the computer of the future. There's no touchscreen. There's no technology visible at all. But when we want to have a video chat or play a game or lay out the slides to our next TED Talk  the objects on the table come alive. Thank you. So  a few years ago I was at JFK Airport about to get on a flight  when I was approached by two women who I do not think would be insulted to hear themselves described as tiny old tough talking Italian American broads. The taller one  who is like up here  she comes marching up to me  and she goes   Honey  I gotta ask you something. You got something to do with that whole 'Eat  Pray  Love' thing that's been going on lately   And I said   Yes  I did.  And she smacks her friend and she goes   See  I told you  I said  that's that girl. That's that girl who wrote that book based on that movie.  So that's who I am. And believe me  I'm extremely grateful to be that person  because that whole  Eat  Pray  Love  thing was a huge break for me. But it also left me in a really tricky position moving forward as an author trying to figure out how in the world I was ever going to write a book again that would ever please anybody  because I knew well in advance that all of those people who had adored  Eat  Pray  Love  were going to be incredibly disappointed in whatever I wrote next because it wasn't going to be  Eat  Pray  Love   and all of those people who had hated  Eat  Pray  Love  were going to be incredibly disappointed in whatever I wrote next because it would provide evidence that I still lived. So I knew that I had no way to win  and knowing that I had no way to win made me seriously consider for a while just quitting the game and moving to the country to raise corgis. But if I had done that  if I had given up writing  I would have lost my beloved vocation  so I knew that the task was that I had to find some way to gin up the inspiration to write the next book regardless of its inevitable negative outcome. In other words  I had to find a way to make sure that my creativity survived its own success. And I did  in the end  find that inspiration  but I found it in the most unlikely and unexpected place. I found it in lessons that I had learned earlier in life about how creativity can survive its own failure. So just to back up and explain  the only thing I have ever wanted to be for my whole life was a writer. I wrote all through childhood  all through adolescence  by the time I was a teenager I was sending my very bad stories to The New Yorker  hoping to be discovered. After college  I got a job as a diner waitress  kept working  kept writing  kept trying really hard to get published  and failing at it. I failed at getting published for almost six years. So for almost six years  every single day  I had nothing but rejection letters waiting for me in my mailbox. And it was devastating every single time  and every single time  I had to ask myself if I should just quit while I was behind and give up and spare myself this pain. But then I would find my resolve  and always in the same way  by saying   I'm not going to quit  I'm going home.  And you have to understand that for me  going home did not mean returning to my family's farm. For me  going home meant returning to the work of writing because writing was my home  because I loved writing more than I hated failing at writing  which is to say that I loved writing more than I loved my own ego  which is ultimately to say that I loved writing more than I loved myself. And that's how I pushed through it. But the weird thing is that    years later  during the crazy ride of  Eat  Pray  Love   I found myself identifying all over again with that unpublished young diner waitress who I used to be  thinking about her constantly  and feeling like I was her again  which made no rational sense whatsoever because our lives could not have been more different. She had failed constantly. I had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation. We had nothing in common. Why did I suddenly feel like I was her all over again  And it was only when I was trying to unthread that that I finally began to comprehend the strange and unlikely psychological connection in our lives between the way we experience great failure and the way we experience great success. So think of it like this  For most of your life  you live out your existence here in the middle of the chain of human experience where everything is normal and reassuring and regular  but failure catapults you abruptly way out over here into the blinding darkness of disappointment. Success catapults you just as abruptly but just as far way out over here into the equally blinding glare of fame and recognition and praise. And one of these fates is objectively seen by the world as bad  and the other one is objectively seen by the world as good  but your subconscious is completely incapable of discerning the difference between bad and good. The only thing that it is capable of feeling is the absolute value of this emotional equation  the exact distance that you have been flung from yourself. And there's a real equal danger in both cases of getting lost out there in the hinterlands of the psyche. But in both cases  it turns out that there is also the same remedy for self restoration  and that is that you have got to find your way back home again as swiftly and smoothly as you can  and if you're wondering what your home is  here's a hint  Your home is whatever in this world you love more than you love yourself. So that might be creativity  it might be family  it might be invention  adventure  faith  service  it might be raising corgis  I don't know  your home is that thing to which you can dedicate your energies with such singular devotion that the ultimate results become inconsequential. For me  that home has always been writing. So after the weird  disorienting success that I went through with  Eat  Pray  Love   I realized that all I had to do was exactly the same thing that I used to have to do all the time when I was an equally disoriented failure. I had to get my ass back to work  and that's what I did  and that's how  in       I was able to publish the dreaded follow up to  Eat  Pray  Love.  And you know what happened with that book  It bombed  and I was fine. Actually  I kind of felt bulletproof  because I knew that I had broken the spell and I had found my way back home to writing for the sheer devotion of it. And I stayed in my home of writing after that  and I wrote another book that just came out last year and that one was really beautifully received  which is very nice  but not my point. My point is that I'm writing another one now  and I'll write another book after that and another and another and another and many of them will fail  and some of them might succeed  but I will always be safe from the random hurricanes of outcome as long as I never forget where I rightfully live. Look  I don't know where you rightfully live  but I know that there's something in this world that you love more than you love yourself. Something worthy  by the way  so addiction and infatuation don't count  because we all know that those are not safe places to live. Right  The only trick is that you've got to identify the best  worthiest thing that you love most  and then build your house right on top of it and don't budge from it. And if you should someday  somehow get vaulted out of your home by either great failure or great success  then your job is to fight your way back to that home the only way that it has ever been done  by putting your head down and performing with diligence and devotion and respect and reverence whatever the task is that love is calling forth from you next. You just do that  and keep doing that again and again and again  and I can absolutely promise you  from long personal experience in every direction  I can assure you that it's all going to be okay. Thank you.  Why    Why   is a question that parents ask me all the time.  Why did my child develop autism   As a pediatrician  as a geneticist  as a researcher  we try and address that question. But autism is not a single condition. It's actually a spectrum of disorders  a spectrum that ranges  for instance  from Justin  a    year old boy who's not verbal  who can't speak  who communicates by using an iPad to touch pictures to communicate his thoughts and his concerns  a little boy who  when he gets upset  will start rocking  and eventually  when he's disturbed enough  will bang his head to the point that he can actually cut it open and require stitches. That same diagnosis of autism  though  also applies to Gabriel  another    year old boy who has quite a different set of challenges. He's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics. He can multiple three numbers by three numbers in his head with ease  yet when it comes to trying to have a conversation  he has great difficulty. He doesn't make eye contact. He has difficulty starting a conversation  feels awkward  and when he gets nervous  he actually shuts down. Yet both of these boys have the same diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. One of the things that concerns us is whether or not there really is an epidemic of autism. These days  one in    children will be diagnosed with autism  and the question is  why does this graph look this way  Has that number been increasing dramatically over time  Or is it because we have now started labeling individuals with autism  simply giving them a diagnosis when they were still present there before yet simply didn't have that label  And in fact  in the late     s  the early     s  legislation was passed that actually provided individuals with autism with resources  with access to educational materials that would help them. With that increased awareness  more parents  more pediatricians  more educators learned to recognize the features of autism. As a result of that  more individuals were diagnosed and got access to the resources they needed. In addition  we've changed our definition over time  so in fact we've widened the definition of autism  and that accounts for some of the increased prevalence that we see. The next question everyone wonders is  what caused autism  And a common misconception is that vaccines cause autism. But let me be very clear  Vaccines do not cause autism. In fact  the original research study that suggested that was the case was completely fraudulent. It was actually retracted from the journal Lancet  in which it was published  and that author  a physician  had his medical license taken away from him. The Institute of Medicine  The Centers for Disease Control  have repeatedly investigated this and there is no credible evidence that vaccines cause autism. Furthermore  one of the ingredients in vaccines  something called thimerosal  was thought to be what the cause of autism was. That was actually removed from vaccines in the year       and you can see that it really did not have an effect in what happened with the prevalence of autism. So again  there is no evidence that this is the answer. So the question remains  what does cause autism  In fact  there's probably not one single answer. Just as autism is a spectrum  there's a spectrum of etiologies  a spectrum of causes. Based on epidemiological data  we know that one of the causes  or one of the associations  I should say  is advanced paternal age  that is  increasing age of the father at the time of conception. In addition  another vulnerable and critical period in terms of development is when the mother is pregnant. During that period  while the fetal brain is developing  we know that exposure to certain agents can actually increase the risk of autism. In particular  there's a medication  valproic acid  which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take  we know can increase that risk of autism. In addition  there can be some infectious agents that can also cause autism. And one of the things I'm going to spend a lot of time focusing on are the genes that can cause autism. I'm focusing on this not because genes are the only cause of autism  but it's a cause of autism that we can readily define and be able to better understand the biology and understand better how the brain works so that we can come up with strategies to be able to intervene. One of the genetic factors that we don't understand  however  is the difference that we see in terms of males and females. Males are affected four to one compared to females with autism  and we really don't understand what that cause is. One of the ways that we can understand that genetics is a factor is by looking at something called the concordance rate. In other words  if one sibling has autism  what's the probability that another sibling in that family will have autism  And we can look in particular at three types of siblings  identical twins  twins that actually share     percent of their genetic information and shared the same intrauterine environment  versus fraternal twins  twins that actually share    percent of their genetic information  versus regular siblings  brother sister  sister sister  also sharing    percent of their genetic information  yet not sharing the same intrauterine environment. And when you look at those concordance ratios  one of the striking things that you will see is that in identical twins  that concordance rate is    percent. Remarkably  though  it's not     percent. It is not that genes account for all of the risk for autism  but yet they account for a lot of that risk  because when you look at fraternal twins  that concordance rate is only    percent. On the other hand  there is a difference between those fraternal twins and the siblings  suggesting that there are common exposures for those fraternal twins that may not be shared as commonly with siblings alone. So this provides some of the data that autism is genetic. Well  how genetic is it  When we compare it to other conditions that we're familiar with  things like cancer  heart disease  diabetes  in fact  genetics plays a much larger role in autism than it does in any of these other conditions. But with this  that doesn't tell us what the genes are. It doesn't even tell us in any one child  is it one gene or potentially a combination of genes  And so in fact  in some individuals with autism  it is genetic  That is  that it is one single  powerful  deterministic gene that causes the autism. However  in other individuals  it's genetic  that is  that it's actually a combination of genes in part with the developmental process that ultimately determines that risk for autism. We don't know in any one person  necessarily  which of those two answers it is until we start digging deeper. So the question becomes  how can we start to identify what exactly those genes are. And let me pose something that might not be intuitive. In certain individuals  they can have autism for a reason that is genetic but yet not because of autism running in the family. And the reason is because in certain individuals  they can actually have genetic changes or mutations that are not passed down from the mother or from the father  but actually start brand new in them  mutations that are present in the egg or the sperm at the time of conception but have not been passed down generation through generation within the family. And we can actually use that strategy to now understand and to identify those genes causing autism in those individuals. So in fact  at the Simons Foundation  we took       individuals that had no family history of autism  and we took that child and their mother and father and used them to try and understand what were those genes causing autism in those cases  To do that  we actually had to comprehensively be able to look at all that genetic information and determine what those differences were between the mother  the father and the child. In doing so  I apologize  I'm going to use an outdated analogy of encyclopedias rather than Wikipedia  but I'm going to do so to try and help make the point that as we did this inventory  we needed to be able to look at massive amounts of information. Our genetic information is organized into a set of    volumes  and when we did that  we had to be able to account for each of those    volumes  because in some cases with autism  there's actually a single volume that's missing. We had to get more granular than that  though  and so we had to start opening those books  and in some cases  the genetic change was more subtle. It might have been a single paragraph that was missing  or yet  even more subtle than that  a single letter  one out of three billion letters that was changed  that was altered  yet had profound effects in terms of how the brain functions and affects behavior. In doing this within these families  we were able to account for approximately    percent of the individuals and determine that there was a single powerful genetic factor that caused autism within those families. On the other hand  there's    percent that we still haven't figured out. As we did this  though  it was really quite humbling  because we realized that there was not simply one gene for autism. In fact  the current estimates are that there are     to     different genes that can cause autism. And that explains  in part  why we see such a broad spectrum in terms of its effects. Although there are that many genes  there is some method to the madness. It's not simply random          different genes  but in fact they fit together. They fit together in a pathway. They fit together in a network that's starting to make sense now in terms of how the brain functions. We're starting to have a bottom up approach where we're identifying those genes  those proteins  those molecules  understanding how they interact together to make that neuron work  understanding how those neurons interact together to make circuits work  and understand how those circuits work to now control behavior  and understand that both in individuals with autism as well as individuals who have normal cognition. But early diagnosis is a key for us. Being able to make that diagnosis of someone who's susceptible at a time in a window where we have the ability to transform  to be able to impact that growing  developing brain is critical. And so folks like Ami Klin have developed methods to be able to take infants  small babies  and be able to use biomarkers  in this case eye contact and eye tracking  to identify an infant at risk. This particular infant  you can see  making very good eye contact with this woman as she's singing  Itsy  Bitsy Spider   in fact is not going to develop autism. This baby we know is going to be in the clear. On the other hand  this other baby is going to go on to develop autism. In this particular child  you can see  it's not making good eye contact. Instead of the eyes focusing in and having that social connection  looking at the mouth  looking at the nose  looking off in another direction  but not again socially connecting  and being able to do this on a very large scale  screen infants  screen children for autism  through something very robust  very reliable  is going to be very helpful to us in terms of being able to intervene at an early stage when we can have the greatest impact. How are we going to intervene  It's probably going to be a combination of factors. In part  in some individuals  we're going to try and use medications. And so in fact  identifying the genes for autism is important for us to identify drug targets  to identify things that we might be able to impact and can be certain that that's really what we need to do in autism. But that's not going to be the only answer. Beyond just drugs  we're going to use educational strategies. Individuals with autism  some of them are wired a little bit differently. They learn in a different way. They absorb their surroundings in a different way  and we need to be able to educate them in a way that serves them best. Beyond that  there are a lot of individuals in this room who have great ideas in terms of new technologies we can use  everything from devices we can use to train the brain to be able to make it more efficient and to compensate for areas in which it has a little bit of trouble  to even things like Google Glass. You could imagine  for instance  Gabriel  with his social awkwardness  might be able to wear Google Glass with an earpiece in his ear  and have a coach be able to help him  be able to help think about conversations  conversation starters  being able to even perhaps one day invite a girl out on a date. All of these new technologies just offer tremendous opportunities for us to be able to impact the individuals with autism  but yet we have a long way to go. As much as we know  there is so much more that we don't know  and so I invite all of you to be able to help us think about how to do this better  to use as a community our collective wisdom to be able to make a difference  and in particular  for the individuals in families with autism  I invite you to join the interactive autism network  to be part of the solution to this  because it's going to take really a lot of us to think about what's important  what's going to be a meaningful difference. As we think about something that's potentially a solution  how well does it work  Is it something that's really going to make a difference in your lives  as an individual  as a family with autism  We're going to need individuals of all ages  from the young to the old  and with all different shapes and sizes of the autism spectrum disorder to make sure that we can have an impact. So I invite all of you to join the mission and to help to be able to make the lives of individuals with autism so much better and so much richer. Thank you. The Olympic motto is  Citius  Altius  Fortius.  Faster  Higher  Stronger. And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly. The winner of the      Olympic marathon ran two hours and eight minutes. Had he been racing against the winner of the      Olympic marathon  he would have won by nearly an hour and a half. Now we all have this feeling that we're somehow just getting better as a human race  inexorably progressing  but it's not like we've evolved into a new species in a century. So what's going on here  I want to take a look at what's really behind this march of athletic progress. In       Jesse Owens held the world record in the     meters. Had Jesse Owens been racing last year in the world championships of the     meters  when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished  Owens would have still had    feet to go. That's a lot in sprinter land. To give you a sense of how much it is  I want to share with you a demonstration conceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker. Now picture the stadium last year at the world championships of the     meters  thousands of fans waiting with baited breath to see Usain Bolt  the fastest man in history  flashbulbs popping as the nine fastest men in the world coil themselves into their blocks. And I want you to pretend that Jesse Owens is in that race. Now close your eyes for a second and picture the race. Bang  The gun goes off. An American sprinter jumps out to the front. Usain Bolt starts to catch him. Usain Bolt passes him  and as the runners come to the finish  you'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line. That's the entire finish of the race. You can open your eyes now. That first beep was Usain Bolt. That last beep was Jesse Owens. Listen to it again. When you think of it like that  it's not that big a difference  is it  And then consider that Usain Bolt started by propelling himself out of blocks down a specially fabricated carpet designed to allow him to travel as fast as humanly possible. Jesse Owens  on the other hand  ran on cinders  the ash from burnt wood  and that soft surface stole far more energy from his legs as he ran. Rather than blocks  Jesse Owens had a gardening trowel that he had to use to dig holes in the cinders to start from. Biomechanical analysis of the speed of Owens' joints shows that had been running on the same surface as Bolt  he wouldn't have been    feet behind  he would have been within one stride. Rather than the last beep  Owens would have been the second beep. Listen to it again. That's the difference track surface technology has made  and it's done it throughout the running world. Consider a longer event. In       Sir Roger Bannister became the first man to run under four minutes in the mile. Nowadays  college kids do that every year. On rare occasions  a high school kid does it. As of the end of last year        men had run under four minutes in the mile  but like Jesse Owens  Sir Roger Bannister ran on soft cinders that stole far more energy from his legs than the synthetic tracks of today. So I consulted biomechanics experts to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders than synthetic tracks  and their consensus that it's one and a half percent slower. So if you apply a one and a half percent slowdown conversion to every man who ran his sub four mile on a synthetic track  this is what happens. Only     are left. If you look at it from that perspective  fewer than ten new men per  year  have joined the sub four mile club since Sir Roger Bannister. Now      is a lot more than one  and that's partly because there are many more people training today and they're training more intelligently. Even college kids are professional in their training compared to Sir Roger Bannister  who trained for    minutes at a time while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school. And that guy who won the      Olympic marathon in three in a half hours  that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy while he ran along the course. That was his idea of a performance enhancing drug. Clearly  athletes have gotten more savvy about performance enhancing drugs as well  and that's made a difference in some sports at some times  but technology has made a difference in all sports  from faster skis to lighter shoes. Take a look at the record for the     meter freestyle swim. The record is always trending downward  but it's punctuated by these steep cliffs. This first cliff  in       is the introduction of the flip turn. Rather than stopping and turning around  athletes could somersault under the water and get going right away in the opposite direction. This second cliff  the introduction of gutters on the side of the pool that allows water to splash off  rather than becoming turbulence that impedes the swimmers as they race. This final cliff  the introduction of full body and low friction swimsuits. Throughout sports  technology has changed the face of performance. In       Eddy Merckx set the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour at    miles        feet. Now that record improved and improved as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic all the way until       when it was set at    miles        feet  nearly five miles farther than Eddy Merckx cycled in     . But then in       the International Cycling Union decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record had to do so with essentially the same equipment that Eddy Merckx used in     . Where does the record stand today     miles        feet  a grand total of     feet farther than Eddy Merckx cycled more than four decades ago. Essentially the entire improvement in this record was due to technology. Still  technology isn't the only thing pushing athletes forward. While indeed we haven't evolved into a new species in a century  the gene pool within competitive sports most certainly has changed. In the early half of the   th century  physical education instructors and coaches had the idea that the average body type was the best for all athletic endeavors  medium height  medium weight  no matter the sport. And this showed in athletes' bodies. In the     s  the average elite high jumper and average elite shot putter were the same exact size. But as that idea started to fade away  as sports scientists and coaches realized that rather than the average body type  you want highly specialized bodies that fit into certain athletic niches  a form of artificial selection took place  a self sorting for bodies that fit certain sports  and athletes' bodies became more different from one another. Today  rather than the same size as the average elite high jumper  the average elite shot putter is two and a half inches taller and     pounds heavier. And this happened throughout the sports world. In fact  if you plot on a height versus mass graph one data point for each of two dozen sports in the first half of the   th century  it looks like this. There's some dispersal  but it's kind of grouped around that average body type. Then that idea started to go away  and at the same time  digital technology    first radio  then television and the Internet    gave millions  or in some cases billions  of people a ticket to consume elite sports performance. The financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes skyrocketed  and it tipped toward the tiny upper echelon of performance. It accelerated the artificial selection for specialized bodies. And if you plot a data point for these same two dozen sports today  it looks like this. The athletes' bodies have gotten much more different from one another. And because this chart looks like the charts that show the expanding universe  with the galaxies flying away from one another  the scientists who discovered it call it  The Big Bang of Body Types.  In sports where height is prized  like basketball  the tall athletes got taller. In       the National Basketball Association signed a groundbreaking agreement making players partners in the league  entitled to shares of ticket revenues and television contracts. Suddenly  anybody who could be an NBA player wanted to be  and teams started scouring the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships. Almost overnight  the proportion of men in the NBA who are at least seven feet tall doubled to    percent. Today  one in    men in the NBA is at least seven feet tall  but a seven foot tall man is incredibly rare in the general population    so rare that if you know an American man between the ages of    and    who is at least seven feet tall  there's a    percent chance he's in the NBA right now. That is  find six honest seven footers  one is in the NBA right now. And that's not the only way that NBA players' bodies are unique. This is Leonardo da Vinci's  Vitruvian Man   the ideal proportions  with arm span equal to height. My arm span is exactly equal to my height. Yours is probably very nearly so. But not the average NBA player. The average NBA player is a shade under  '    with arms that are seven feet long. Not only are NBA players ridiculously tall  they are ludicrously long. Had Leonardo wanted to draw the Vitruvian NBA Player  he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse  not a circle and a square. So in sports where large size is prized  the large athletes have gotten larger. Conversely  in sports where diminutive stature is an advantage  the small athletes got smaller. The average elite female gymnast shrunk from  '   to  '   on average over the last    years  all the better for their power to weight ratio and for spinning in the air. And while the large got larger and the small got smaller  the weird got weirder. The average length of the forearm of a water polo player in relation to their total arm got longer  all the better for a forceful throwing whip. And as the large got larger  small got smaller  and the weird weirder. In swimming  the ideal body type is a long torso and short legs. It's like the long hull of a canoe for speed over the water. And the opposite is advantageous in running. You want long legs and a short torso. And this shows in athletes' bodies today. Here you see Michael Phelps  the greatest swimmer in history  standing next to Hicham El Guerrouj  the world record holder in the mile. These men are seven inches different in height  but because of the body types advantaged in their sports  they wear the same length pants. Seven inches difference in height  these men have the same length legs. Now in some cases  the search for bodies that could push athletic performance forward ended up introducing into the competitive world populations of people that weren't previously competing at all  like Kenyan distance runners. We think of Kenyans as being great marathoners. Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe as being great marathoners. The Kalenjin make up just    percent of the Kenyan population but the vast majority of elite runners. And they happen  on average  to have a certain unique physiology  legs that are very long and very thin at their extremity  and this is because they have their ancestry at very low latitude in a very hot and dry climate  and an evolutionary adaptation to that is limbs that are very long and very thin at the extremity for cooling purposes. It's the same reason that a radiator has long coils  to increase surface area compared to volume to let heat out  and because the leg is like a pendulum  the longer and thinner it is at the extremity  the more energy efficient it is to swing. To put Kalenjin running success in perspective  consider that    American men in history have run faster than two hours and    minutes in the marathon. That's a four minute and    second per mile pace. Thirty two Kalenjin men did that last October. That's from a source population the size of metropolitan Atlanta. Still  even changing technology and the changing gene pool in sports don't account for all of the changes in performance. Athletes have a different mindset than they once did. Have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets an electrical shock and they're thrown across a room  There's no explosion there. What's happening when that happens is that the electrical impulse is causing all their muscle fibers to twitch at once  and they're throwing themselves across the room. They're essentially jumping. That's the power that's contained in the human body. But normally we can't access nearly all of it. Our brain acts as a limiter  preventing us from accessing all of our physical resources  because we might hurt ourselves  tearing tendons or ligaments. But the more we learn about how that limiter functions  the more we learn how we can push it back just a bit  in some cases by convincing the brain that the body won't be in mortal danger by pushing harder. Endurance and ultra endurance sports serve as a great example. Ultra endurance was once thought to be harmful to human health  but now we realize that we have all these traits that are perfect for ultra endurance  no body fur and a glut of sweat glands that keep us cool while running  narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames  large surface area of joints for shock absorption. We have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring  short toes that are better for pushing off than for grasping tree limbs  and when we run  we can turn our torso and our shoulders like this while keeping our heads straight. Our primate cousins can't do that. They have to run like this. And we have big old butt muscles that keep us upright while running. Have you ever looked at an ape's butt  They have no buns because they don't run upright. And as athletes have realized that we're perfectly suited for ultra endurance  they've taken on feats that would have been unthinkable before  athletes like Spanish endurance racer K lian Jornet. Here's K lian running up the Matterhorn. With a sweatshirt there tied around his waist. It's so steep he can't even run here. He's pulling up on a rope. This is a vertical ascent of more than       feet  and K lian went up and down in under three hours. Amazing. And talented though he is  K lian is not a physiological freak. Now that he has done this  other athletes will follow  just as other athletes followed after Sir Roger Bannister ran under four minutes in the mile. Changing technology  changing genes  and a changing mindset. Innovation in sports  whether that's new track surfaces or new swimming techniques  the democratization of sport  the spread to new bodies and to new populations around the world  and imagination in sport  an understanding of what the human body is truly capable of  have conspired to make athletes stronger  faster  bolder  and better than ever. Thank you very much. There are    million people in the world who are blind. Eighty percent of them are living in low income countries such as Kenya  and the absolute majority do not need to be blind. They are blind from diseases that are either completely curable or preventable. Knowing this  with my young family  we moved to Kenya. We secured equipment  funds  vehicles  we trained a team  we set up a hundred clinics throughout the Great Rift Valley to try and understand a single question  why are people going blind  and what can we do  The challenges were great. When we got to where we were going  we set up our high tech equipment. Power was rarely available. We'd have to run our equipment from petrol power generators. And then something occurred to me  There has to be an easier way  because it's the patients who are the most in need of access to eye care who are the least likely to get it. More people in Kenya  and in sub Saharan Africa  have access to a mobile phone than they do clean running water. So we said  could we harness the power of mobile technology to deliver eye care in a new way  And so we developed Peek  a smartphone  system  that enables community healthcare workers and empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere. We set about replacing traditional hospital equipment  which is bulky  expensive and fragile  with smartphone apps and hardware that make it possible to test anyone in any language and of any age. Here we have a demonstration of a three month old having their vision accurately tested using an app and an eye tracker. We've got many trials going on in the community and in schools  and through the lessons that we've learned in the field  we've realized it's extremely important to share the data in non medical jargon so that people understand what we're examining and what that means to them. So here  for example  we use our sight sim application  once your vision has been measured  to show carers and teachers what the visual world is like for that person  so they can empathize with them and help them. Once we've discovered somebody has low vision  the next big challenge is to work out why  and to be able to do that  we need to have access to the inside of the eye. Traditionally  this requires expensive equipment to examine an area called the retina. The retina is the single part of the eye that has huge amounts of information about the body and its health. We've developed  D printed  low cost hardware that comes in at less than five dollars to produce  which can then be clipped onto a smartphone and makes it possible to get views of the back of the eye of a very high quality. And the beauty is  anybody can do it. In our trials on over two and half thousand people  the smartphone with the add on clip is comparable to a camera that is hugely more expensive and hugely more difficult to transport. When we first moved to Kenya  we went with         dollars of equipment  a team of    people  and that was what was needed to deliver health care. Now  all that's needed is a single person on a bike with a smartphone. And it costs just     dollars. The issue of power supply is overcome by harnessing the power of solar. Our healthcare workers travel with a solar powered rucksack which keeps the phone charged and backed up. Now we go to the patient rather than waiting for the patient never to come. We go to them in their homes and we give them the most comprehensive  high tech  accurate examination  which can be delivered by anyone with minimal training. We can link global experts with people in the most rural  difficult to reach places that are beyond the end of the road  effectively putting those experts in their homes  allowing us to make diagnoses and make plans for treatment. Project managers  hospital directors  are able to search on our interface by any parameter they may be interested in. Here in Nakuru  where I've been living  we can search for people by whatever condition. Here are people who are blind from a curable condition cataract. Each red pin depicts somebody who is blind from a disease that is curable and treatable  and they're locatable. We can use bulk text messaging services to explain that we're coming to arrange a treatment. What's more  we've learned that this is something that we haven't built just for the community but with the community. Those blue pins that drop represent elders  or local leaders  that are connected to those people who can ensure that we can find them and arrange treatment. So for patients like Mama Wangari  who have been blind for over    years and never seen her grandchildren  for less than    dollars  we can restore her eyesight. This is something that has to happen. It's only in statistics that people go blind by the millions. The reality is everyone goes blind on their own. But now  they might just be a text message away from help. And now because live demos are always a bad idea  we're going to try a live demo. So here we have the Peek Vision app. Okay  and what we're looking at here  this is Sam's optic nerve  which is a direct extension of her brain  so I'm actually looking at her brain as we look there. We can see all parts of the retina. It makes it possible to pick up diseases of the eye and of the body that would not be possible without access to the eye  and that clip on device can be manufactured for just a few dollars  and people can be cured of blindness  and I think it says a lot about us as a human race if we've developed cures and we don't deliver them. But now we can. Thank you. We live in a very complex environment  complexity and dynamism and patterns of evidence from satellite photographs  from videos. You can even see it outside your window. It's endlessly complex  but somehow familiar  but the patterns kind of repeat  but they never repeat exactly. It's a huge challenge to understand. The patterns that you see are there at all of the different scales  but you can't chop it into one little bit and say   Oh  well let me just make a smaller climate.  I can't use the normal products of reductionism to get a smaller and smaller thing that I can study in a laboratory and say   Oh  now that's something I now understand.  It's the whole or it's nothing. The different scales that give you these kinds of patterns range over an enormous range of magnitude  roughly    orders of magnitude  from the small microscopic particles that seed clouds to the size of the planet itself  from    to the minus six to    to the eight     orders of spatial magnitude. In time  from milliseconds to millennia  again around    orders of magnitude. What does that mean  Okay  well if you think about how you can calculate these things  you can take what you can see  okay  I'm going to chop it up into lots of little boxes  and that's the result of physics  right  And if I think about a weather model  that spans about five orders of magnitude  from the planet to a few kilometers  and the time scale from a few minutes to    days  maybe a month. We're interested in more than that. We're interested in the climate. That's years  that's millennia  and we need to go to even smaller scales. The stuff that we can't resolve  the sub scale processes  we need to approximate in some way. That is a huge challenge. Climate models in the     s took an even smaller chunk of that  only about three orders of magnitude. Climate models in the     s  kind of what we're working with now  four orders of magnitude. We have    to go  and we're increasing our capability of simulating those at about one extra order of magnitude every decade. One extra order of magnitude in space is        times more calculations. And we keep adding more things  more questions to these different models. So what does a climate model look like  This is an old climate model  admittedly  a punch card  a single line of Fortran code. We no longer use punch cards. We do still use Fortran. New fangled ideas like C really haven't had a big impact on the climate modeling community. But how do we go about doing it  How do we go from that complexity that you saw to a line of code  We do it one piece at a time. This is a picture of sea ice taken flying over the Arctic. We can look at all of the different equations that go into making the ice grow or melt or change shape. We can look at the fluxes. We can look at the rate at which snow turns to ice  and we can code that. We can encapsulate that in code. These models are around a million lines of code at this point  and growing by tens of thousands of lines of code every year. So you can look at that piece  but you can look at the other pieces too. What happens when you have clouds  What happens when clouds form  when they dissipate  when they rain out  That's another piece. What happens when we have radiation coming from the sun  going through the atmosphere  being absorbed and reflected  We can code each of those very small pieces as well. There are other pieces  the winds changing the ocean currents. We can talk about the role of vegetation in transporting water from the soils back into the atmosphere. And each of these different elements we can encapsulate and put into a system. Each of those pieces ends up adding to the whole. And you get something like this. You get a beautiful representation of what's going on in the climate system  where each and every one of those emergent patterns that you can see  the swirls in the Southern Ocean  the tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico  and there's two more that are going to pop up in the Pacific at any point now  those rivers of atmospheric water  all of those are emergent properties that come from the interactions of all of those small scale processes I mentioned. There's no code that says   Do a wiggle in the Southern Ocean.  There's no code that says   Have two tropical cyclones that spin around each other.  All of those things are emergent properties. This is all very good. This is all great. But what we really want to know is what happens to these emergent properties when we kick the system  When something changes  what happens to those properties  And there's lots of different ways to kick the system. There are wobbles in the Earth's orbit over hundreds of thousands of years that change the climate. There are changes in the solar cycles  every    years and longer  that change the climate. Big volcanoes go off and change the climate. Changes in biomass burning  in smoke  in aerosol particles  all of those things change the climate. The ozone hole changed the climate. Deforestation changes the climate by changing the surface properties and how water is evaporated and moved around in the system. Contrails change the climate by creating clouds where there were none before  and of course greenhouse gases change the system. Each of these different kicks provides us with a target to evaluate whether we understand something about this system. So we can go to look at what model skill is. Now I use the word  skill  advisedly  Models are not right or wrong  they're always wrong. They're always approximations. The question you have to ask is whether a model tells you more information than you would have had otherwise. If it does  it's skillful. This is the impact of the ozone hole on sea level pressure  so low pressure  high pressures  around the southern oceans  around Antarctica. This is observed data. This is modeled data. There's a good match because we understand the physics that controls the temperatures in the stratosphere and what that does to the winds around the southern oceans. We can look at other examples. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in      put an enormous amount of aerosols  small particles  into the stratosphere. That changed the radiation balance of the whole planet. There was less energy coming in than there was before  so that cooled the planet  and those red lines and those green lines  those are the differences between what we expected and what actually happened. The models are skillful  not just in the global mean  but also in the regional patterns. I could go through a dozen more examples  the skill associated with solar cycles  changing the ozone in the stratosphere  the skill associated with orbital changes over       years. We can look at that too  and the models are skillful. The models are skillful in response to the ice sheets        years ago. The models are skillful when it comes to the   th century trends over the decades. Models are successful at modeling lake outbursts into the North Atlantic       years ago. And we can get a good match to the data. Each of these different targets  each of these different evaluations  leads us to add more scope to these models  and leads us to more and more complex situations that we can ask more and more interesting questions  like  how does dust from the Sahara  that you can see in the orange  interact with tropical cyclones in the Atlantic  How do organic aerosols from biomass burning  which you can see in the red dots  intersect with clouds and rainfall patterns  How does pollution  which you can see in the white wisps of sulfate pollution in Europe  how does that affect the temperatures at the surface and the sunlight that you get at the surface  We can look at this across the world. We can look at the pollution from China. We can look at the impacts of storms on sea salt particles in the atmosphere. We can see the combination of all of these different things happening all at once  and we can ask much more interesting questions. How do air pollution and climate coexist  Can we change things that affect air pollution and climate at the same time  The answer is yes. So this is a history of the   th century. The first one is the model. The weather is a little bit different to what actually happened. The second one are the observations. And we're going through the     s. There's variability  there are things going on  but it's all kind of in the noise. As you get towards the     s  things are going to start to change. They're going to start to look more similar  and by the time you get to the     s  you're already seeing the patterns of global warming  both in the observations and in the model. We know what happened over the   th century. Right  We know that it's gotten warmer. We know where it's gotten warmer. And if you ask the models why did that happen  and you say  okay  well  yes  basically it's because of the carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere. We have a very good match up until the present day. But there's one key reason why we look at models  and that's because of this phrase here. Because if we had observations of the future  we obviously would trust them more than models  But unfortunately  observations of the future are not available at this time. So when we go out into the future  there's a difference. The future is unknown  the future is uncertain  and there are choices. Here are the choices that we have. We can do some work to mitigate the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. That's the top one. We can do more work to really bring it down so that by the end of the century  it's not much more than there is now. Or we can just leave it to fate and continue on with a business as usual type of attitude. The differences between these choices can't be answered by looking at models. There's a great phrase that Sherwood Rowland  who won the Nobel Prize for the chemistry that led to ozone depletion  when he was accepting his Nobel Prize  he asked this question   What is the use of having developed a science well enough to make predictions if  in the end  all we're willing to do is stand around and wait for them to come true   The models are skillful  but what we do with the information from those models is totally up to you. Thank you. First of all  for those of you who are not familiar with my work  I create multicultural characters  so characters from lots of different backgrounds. So before the present is the new future  a bit about the past is that I grew up in a family that was multi everything    multi racial  multi cultural  black and white  Caribbean  Irish American  German American. There was Dominican music blasting from stereos. There were Christians and Jews. That's a long story filled with intrigue and interfaith guilt and shame. But I was totally immersed in this world that was filled with everybody  and then I went on to the United Nations school  and that just completely   So I began sort of developing these voices and these people  all of whom were loosely based on people I really know  and so  for example  in performing them  I would really try to inhabit them. And for example  I don't really talk like that  but that was one of my people  and I'm going to bring a few of my friends    I think of them as my friends   to this stage  in this spirit of the idea that the present is the new future  in sort of a meta way  because I thought about it  and the future  for me  what can be so frightening is that I don't know what's coming. I don't know if that's true for other people  but that notion of thinking about how we can understand the future and predict outcomes  for me  it's terrifying to not know what might be coming. And so the idea that there are questions that I've never seen that my people are going to answer  and some of these characters have been with me for ages  some of them don't even have names  I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know what's coming  and all I can do is remind myself that I told Chris I'd fly by the seat of my pants  and now that I'm up here it sort of feels like that dream where you don't have any pants on  and so I suppose I'm going to be flying by the seat of my ass. That said  let's just see who comes out. May we have the first question   Do you ever get headaches from the microchips implanted in your brain   Right. Okay. Well first of all  I'll just say that I hope you can hear me okay. My name is Lorraine Levine  and the idea of microchips implanted in my brain  frankly  just putting on my glasses reminds me of thank God I'm not wearing the Google Glasses. No offense to them. I'm glad that you all enjoy them  but at my age  just putting on the regular ones I have already gives me too much information. Do you understand what I'm saying to you  I don't need to know more. I don't want to know. That's it. That's enough. I love you all. You're wonderful. It's fabulous to be here with such big machers again this year. Mwah  Okay  next question.  Applause  Next  please.  Is dating boring  now that humans reproduce asexually   Who do we got  Hi  um  okay  hi everybody. My name is Nereida. I just want to say first of all that dating is never boring under any circumstance. But I am very excited to be here right now  so I am just trying to remind myself that  you know  like  the purpose of being here and everything  I mean  trying to answer these questions  it is very exciting. But I also  I just need to acknowledge that TED is an incredible experience right now in the present  like  I just need to say  like  Isabel Allende. Isabel Allende  Okay  maybe it doesn't mean  of course it means something to you  but to me  it's like  another level  okay  Because I'm Latina and I really appreciate the fact that there are role models here that I can really  I don't know  I just need to say that. That's incredible to me  and sometimes when I'm nervous and everything like that  I just need to  like  say some affirmations that can help me. I usually just try to use  like  the three little words that always make me feel better  Sotomayor  Sotomayor  Sotomayor.  Laughter  Just  it really helps me to get grounded. Now I can use Allende  Allende  Allende  and  you know  I just need to say it  like  it's so incredible to be here  and I knew that we were going to have these questions. I was so nervous and I was thinking just  like  oh my God  oh my God  and reminding me  because I've had  like  some very  especially since the last time we were here at TED  it was  like  unbelievable  and then right after that  like  so many crazy things happened  like  we ended up going to the White House to perform. That was  like  amazing  and I'm standing there  and I was just like  please don't say   Oh my God.  Don't say   Oh my God.  And I just kept saying it   Oh my God. Oh my God.  And  you know  I kept thinking to myself  like  President Obama has to come up here at the same podium  and I'm standing here saying   Oh my God.  It's like  the separation of church and state. It's just  I couldn't  like  I couldn't process. It was really too much. So I think I've lost my way. But what I wanted to say is that dating  for me  you know  as far as I'm concerned  however you reproduce  as long as you're enjoying yourself and it's with another consenting asexual    I don't know. You know where I'm going with that. Okay  ciao  gracias. Okay  next question.  Applause  What are your top five favorite songs right now  All right  well first of all  I'mma say  you know what I'm saying  I'm the only dude up here right now. My name is Rashid  and I never been at TED before  you know what I'm saying. I think  Sarah Jones  maybe she didn't want me to come out last time. I don't know why. You know what I'm saying. Obviously I would be like a perfect fit for TED. You know what I'm saying. First of all  that I'm in hip hop  you know what I'm saying. I know some of y'all may be not really as much into the music  but the first way y'all can always know  you know what I'm saying  that I'm in hip hop  is 'cos I hold the microphone in an official emcee posture. Y'all can see that right there. That's how you hold it. All right  so you get your little tutorial right there. But when Sarah Jones told me we was gonna come up here  I was like  betch  you know what I'm saying  TED is real fly  I got a whole lot of dope  you know what I'm saying  shit going on and everything  but she was like  yeah  we're going to have to answer  like  some random questions  just like  and I was like  what the hell is that  You know what I'm saying  just stand up there and answer some random questions  I don't want to  I mean  it's like an intellectual stop and frisk. You know what I'm saying   Laughter  I don't want to be standing up there just all getting interrogated and whatnot. That's what I'm trying to leave behind in New York. You know what I'm saying  So anyway  I would have to say my top five songs right now is all out of my own personal catalogue  you know what I mean  So if you want to know more about that  you know what I'm saying  we could talk about the anti piracy and all that  but as far as I'm concerned  you know  I believe in creative commons  and I think it's really important that  you know  that needs to be sustainable and everything  and I mean  as far as I'm concerned  I mean  this right here  this environment  I would like to sustain. You know what I mean  But I'm just saying  if y'all are interested in the top five songs  you need to holler at me. You know what I'm saying  Aight  In the future or the present. Yeah. Enjoy the rest of it. Okay  next question. What do you got   How many of your organs have been  D printed   Well I have to say that I don't know about how many of my organs have been   D printed as such  but I can tell you that it is so challenging to me  kind of thinking about this concept of the future and that  you know  all around the world parents are kind of telling their small children  please  you have to eat that  you know  I have slaved over a hot  D printer all day so that you can have this meal. You know  that kind of thing. And of course now that we have changed  you know  from the global South  there is this total kind of perspective shift that is happening around the    You can't just say to them  well  there are starving children. Well  it is the future. Nobody is starving anymore  thank God. But as you can tell I have kind of that optimism  and I do hope that we can continue to kind of  D print  well  let us just say I like to think that even in the future we will have the publication  kind of  you know  all the food that's fit to print. But everybody  please do enjoy that  and again  I think that you do throw a cracking good party here at TED. Thank you. Next question.  Applause  What has changed  Okay  it's like  I have to think about that.  What has changed now that women run the world   First of all  I really  like  I just want to say  and my name is Bella  I just want to  like  identify myself  that  like  as a feminist  I  like  I really find that  like  because I was born in the '  s  and  like  there were a lot of women who were as far as feminism was concerned  like  maybe they didn't understand that  like  a feminist like me  like  I don't think it's required that you have to have a certain kind of voice  or  like  a certain way of presenting yourself to be feminist  because I think that  like  feminism can be really hot  and I think actually that it's really vital and important. Like  the quotation I'm wearing is from  like  Gloria Steinem  and  like  I'm named Bella for  like  Bella Abzug  who's  like  obviously  like  a really important feminist from  like  history  and like  I just think that those women  like  really represent  like  that you can  like  be vital and  like  amazing  like  a mazing  and you don't have to wear  like  an Eileen Fisher caftan  just to  like  prove that you are a feminist. Like  not that there's anything wrong with that  but my mom  she's like  like  why do you have to wear pants that  like  objectify your body  I like my pants. Like  I like my voice. Like  she's like  why do you have to talk like   Talk like what  Like  I'm expressing myself  and I think that we have to  like  reach out  like  not only across  like  the different generations of feminists  but also across the  like  vocal ranges  so that  like  we  because otherwise it's just  like  restriculous within feminism  which is just  like  a word that I created that means  like  so strict it's ridiculous. So that's my feeling about that. You guys are a mazing  by the way. Okay. Next question.   They've discovered a cure for cancer  but not baldness  What's up with that    Yeah  you know what  so my name is Joseph Mancuso. First of all  I just want to say that I appreciate that TED in general has been a pretty orderly crowd  a pretty orderly group. And  you know  I just have to say  the whole thing with baldness  and  you know  here's the thing. As long as the woman  in my case    because it's a modern world  do whatever you want to do  I don't have any problem with anybody  enjoy yourself  LGBTQLMNOP. All right  But as far as I'm concerned  attractiveness  women don't really care as much as you think they do about the  you know. I mean  I remember hearing this woman. She loved her husband  it was the sweetest thing. It's a pretty young girl  you know  And this guy's older. And  you know  she said she would love him even if he had snow on the roof or even if melted and disappeared altogether. As far as I'm concerned  it's about the love. Am I right  or am I right  So that's it. That's it. That's it. I don't got nothing more to say. Keep your noses clean. All right  next question.  Have you ever tasted meat that's not lab grown   Um  well  I  I want to start by saying that this is a very difficult experience for a Chinese American. I don't know what to call myself now  because I have really my Chinese identity  but my kids  they are American Chinese  but it's difficult to try to express myself in front of audience of people like this. But if had to give my opinion about meat  I think first  the most important thing is to say that we don't have to have perfect food  but maybe it can also not be poison. Maybe we can have some middle ground for that. But I will continue to consider this idea  and I will report back maybe next year. Next. Next. Next.  Applause   Will there ever be a post racial world   Thank you for having me. My name is Gary Weaselhead. Enjoy that. I'm a member of the Blackfeet Nation. I'm also half Lakota  but that is my given name  and no  even though it would have seemed like an obvious choice  no  I did not go into politics. Tough crowd. But I always like to just let people know when they ask about race or those kinds of things  you know  as a member of the First Nations community  you know  I'm probably not your typical guy. For example  in addition to being an activist  I'm also a professional stand up comedian. And  you know  I'm most popular on college and university campuses. You know  whenever they want to do a diversity day  or hey we're not all white week  then I'm there.  Laughter  Do I think there will ever be a post racial world  I think  really  I can't talk about race without remembering that it is a construct in certain respects  but also that  you know  until we redress the wrongs of the past  we're going to be turned around. I don't care if the present is the new future. I think there's a lot of great people here at TED who are working to address that  so with that  if anything I've said today makes you feel uncomfortable  you're welcome. I think we have time for one more.  What's the most popular diet these days   Who's here  Okay  well  I'm just gonna answer this really fast  as  like  three or four different people. I mean really fast. I'm just gonna let y'all know that  as far as diet is concerned  if you don't love yourself inside  there is no diet on this Earth that is going to make your behind small enough for you to feel good  so just stop wasting your time. I would just like to say as an African woman that I believe the diet that we need is really to remove the crazy belief that there is anything wrong with a nice backside. No  I am teasing about that. There is nothing wrong with a woman of size. That is what I am trying to say. Women  celebrate your body  for God's sake. Stop running around starving. You are making yourselves and other people miserable. Last answer. So we're talking about what's the most popular diet  I'm gonna start off by telling y'all that this is my first time here at TED. I might not be your typical person you find on this stage. My dental work not as nice as some people. But I made Sarah Jones promise she gonna bring me this time  'cause she didn't bring me before  but you know  I just want to say  there's a lot of things more important than counting calories  and as somebody living on the streets in New York  and getting to come here  hear y'all ideas worth spreading  I want to tell y'all I believe in this idea that the present is the new future  that where you sit  you create everything that's gonna come  for better or worse. And for me  I think homeless is the wrong word for it anyway. You know  I might not have me no place to lay my head at night  but that just makes me houseless. I have me a home. You do too. Find it and try to find yourself in there. Make sure you know  it's not just about virtual reality in space. That's wonderful  but it's also about the actual reality here on Earth. How are people living today  How can you be part of the solution  Thank y'all for thinking about that right now in the present moment to influence the future. I appreciate it. Bye bye. Thank you all very  very much. Thank you for trusting me  Chris. When I was a young officer  they told me to follow my instincts  to go with my gut  and what I've learned is that often our instincts are wrong. In the summer of       there was a massive leak of classified documents that came out of the Pentagon. It shocked the world  it shook up the American government  and it made people ask a lot of questions  because the sheer amount of information that was let out  and the potential impacts  were significant. And one of the first questions we asked ourselves was why would a young soldier have access to that much information  Why would we let sensitive things be with a relatively young person  In the summer of       I was assigned to command a special operations task force  and that task force was spread across the Mideast to fight al Qaeda. Our main effort was inside Iraq  and our specified mission was to defeat al Qaeda in Iraq. For almost five years I stayed there  and we focused on fighting a war that was unconventional and it was difficult and it was bloody and it often claimed its highest price among innocent people. We did everything we could to stop al Qaeda and the foreign fighters that came in as suicide bombers and as accelerants to the violence. We honed our combat skills  we developed new equipment  we parachuted  we helicoptered  we took small boats  we drove  and we walked to objectives night after night to stop the killing that this network was putting forward. We bled  we died  and we killed to stop that organization from the violence that they were putting largely against the Iraqi people. Now  we did what we knew  how we had grown up  and one of the things that we knew  that was in our DNA  was secrecy. It was security. It was protecting information. It was the idea that information was the lifeblood and it was what would protect and keep people safe. And we had a sense that  as we operated within our organizations  it was important to keep information in the silos within the organizations  particularly only give information to people had a demonstrated need to know. But the question often came  who needed to know  Who needed  who had to have the information so that they could do the important  parts of the job that you needed  And in a tightly coupled world  that's very hard to predict. It's very hard to know who needs to have information and who doesn't. I used to deal with intelligence agencies  and I'd complain that they weren't sharing enough intelligence  and with a straight face  they'd look at me and they'd say   What aren't you getting    Laughter  I said   If I knew that  we wouldn't have a problem.  But what we found is we had to change. We had to change our culture about information. We had to knock down walls. We had to share. We had to change from who needs to know to the fact that who doesn't know  and we need to tell  and tell them as quickly as we can. It was a significant culture shift for an organization that had secrecy in its DNA. We started by doing things  by building  not working in offices  knocking down walls  working in things we called situation awareness rooms  and in the summer of       something happened which demonstrated this. We captured the personnel records for the people who were bringing foreign fighters into Iraq. And when we got the personnel records  typically  we would have hidden these  shared them with a few intelligence agencies  and then try to operate with them. But as I was talking to my intelligence officer  I said   What do we do   And he said   Well  you found them.  Our command.  You can just declassify them.  And I said   Well  can we declassify them  What if the enemy finds out   And he says   They're their personnel records.  So we did  and a lot of people got upset about that  but as we passed that information around  suddenly you find that information is only of value if you give it to people who have the ability to do something with it. The fact that I know something has zero value if I'm not the person who can actually make something better because of it. So as a consequence  what we did was we changed the idea of information  instead of knowledge is power  to one where sharing is power. It was the fundamental shift  not new tactics  not new weapons  not new anything else. It was the idea that we were now part of a team in which information became the essential link between us  not a block between us. And I want everybody to take a deep breath and let it out  because in your life  there's going to be information that leaks out you're not going to like. Somebody's going to get my college grades out  a that's going to be a disaster.  Laughter  But it's going to be okay  and I will tell you that I am more scared of the bureaucrat that holds information in a desk drawer or in a safe than I am of someone who leaks  because ultimately  we'll be better off if we share. Thank you. Helen Walters  So I don't know if you were here this morning  if you were able to catch Rick Ledgett  the deputy director of the NSA who was responding to Edward Snowden's talk earlier this week. I just wonder  do you think the American government should give Edward Snowden amnesty  Stanley McChrystal  I think that Rick said something very important. We  most people  don't know all the facts. I think there are two parts of this. Edward Snowden shined a light on an important need that people had to understand. He also took a lot of documents that he didn't have the knowledge to know the importance of  so I think we need to learn the facts about this case before we make snap judgments about Edward Snowden. HW  Thank you so much. Thank you. So  I have a feature on my website where every week people submit hypothetical questions for me to answer  and I try to answer them using math  science and comics. So for example  one person asked  what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at    percent of the speed of light  So I did some calculations. Now  normally  when an object flies through the air  the air will flow around the object  but in this case  the ball would be going so fast that the air molecules wouldn't have time to move out of the way. The ball would smash right into and through them  and the collisions with these air molecules would knock away the nitrogen  carbon and hydrogen from the ball  fragmenting it off into tiny particles  and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion in the air around it. This would result in a flood of x rays that would spread out in a bubble along with exotic particles  plasma inside  centered on the pitcher's mound  and that would move away from the pitcher's mound slightly faster than the ball. Now at this point  about    nanoseconds in  the home plate is far enough away that light hasn't had time to reach it  which means the batter still sees the pitcher about to throw and has no idea that anything is wrong. Now  after    nanoseconds  the ball will reach home plate  or at least the cloud of expanding plasma that used to be the ball  and it will engulf the bat and the batter and the plate and the catcher and the umpire and start disintegrating them all as it also starts to carry them backward through the backstop  which also starts to disintegrate. So if you were watching this whole thing from a hill  ideally  far away  what you'd see is a bright flash of light that would fade over a few seconds  followed by a blast wave spreading out  shredding trees and houses as it moves away from the stadium  and then eventually a mushroom cloud rising up over the ruined city.  Laughter  So the Major League Baseball rules are a little bit hazy  but    Laughter    under rule  .   and  .    I think that in this situation  the batter would be considered hit by pitch and would be eligible to take first base  if it still existed. So this is the kind of question I answer  and I get people writing in with a lot of other strange questions. I've had someone write and say  scientifically speaking  what is the best and fastest way to hide a body  Can you do this one soon  And I had someone write in  I've had people write in about  can you prove whether or not you can find love again after your heart's broken  And I've had people send in what are clearly homework questions they're trying to get me to do for them. But one week  a couple months ago  I got a question that was actually about Google. If all digital data in the world were stored on punch cards  how big would Google's data warehouse be  Now  Google's pretty secretive about their operations  so no one really knows how much data Google has  and in fact  no one really knows how many data centers Google has  except people at Google itself. And I've tried  I've met them a few times  tried asking them  and they aren't revealing anything. So I decided to try to figure this out myself. There are a few things that I looked at here. I started with money. Google has to reveal how much they spend  in general  and that lets you put some caps on how many data centers could they be building  because a big data center costs a certain amount of money. And you can also then put a cap on how much of the world hard drive market are they taking up  which turns out  it's pretty sizable. I read a calculation at one point  I think Google has a drive failure about every minute or two  and they just throw out the hard drive and swap in a new one. So they go through a huge number of them. And so by looking at money  you can get an idea of how many of these centers they have. You can also look at power. You can look at how much electricity they need  because you need a certain amount of electricity to run the servers  and Google is more efficient than most  but they still have some basic requirements  and that lets you put a limit on the number of servers that they have. You can also look at square footage and see of the data centers that you know  how big are they  How much room is that  How many server racks could you fit in there  And for some data centers  you might get two of these pieces of information. You know how much they spent  and they also  say  because they had to contract with the local government to get the power provided  you might know what they made a deal to buy  so you know how much power it takes. Then you can look at the ratios of those numbers  and figure out for a data center where you don't have that information  you can figure out  but maybe you only have one of those  you know the square footage  then you could figure out well  maybe the power is proportional. And you can do this same thing with a lot of different quantities  you know  with guesses about the total amount of storage  the number of servers  the number of drives per server  and in each case using what you know to come up with a model that narrows down your guesses for the things that you don't know. It's sort of circling around the number you're trying to get. And this is a lot of fun. The math is not all that advanced  and really it's like nothing more than solving a sudoku puzzle. So what I did  I went through all of this information  spent a day or two researching. And there are some things I didn't look at. You could always look at the Google recruitment messages that they post. That gives you an idea of where they have people. Sometimes  when people visit a data center  they'll take a cell cam photo and post it  and they aren't supposed to  but you can learn things about their hardware that way. And in fact  you can just look at pizza delivery drivers. Turns out  they know where all the Google data centers are  at least the ones that have people in them. But I came up with my estimate  which I felt pretty good about  that was about    exabytes of data across all of Google's operations  and then another maybe five exabytes or so of offline storage in tape drives  which it turns out Google is about the world's largest consumer of. So I came up with this estimate  and this is a staggering amount of data. It's quite a bit more than any other organization in the world has  as far as we know. There's a couple of other contenders  especially everyone always thinks of the NSA. But using some of these same methods  we can look at the NSA's data centers  and figure out  you know  we don't know what's going on there  but it's pretty clear that their operation is not the size of Google's. Adding all of this up  I came up with the other thing that we can answer  which is  how many punch cards would this take  And so a punch card can hold about    characters  and you can fit about       or so cards into a box  and you put them in  say  my home region of New England  it would cover the entire region up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers  which is about three times deeper than the glaciers during the last ice age about        years ago. So this is impractical  but I think that's about the best answer I could come up with. And I posted it on my website. I wrote it up. And I didn't expect to get an answer from Google  because of course they've been so secretive  they didn't answer of my questions  and so I just put it up and said  well  I guess we'll never know. But then a little while later I got a message  a couple weeks later  from Google  saying  hey  someone here has an envelope for you. So I go and get it  open it up  and it's punch cards.  Laughter  Google branded punch cards. And on these punch cards  there are a bunch of holes  and I said  thank you  thank you  okay  so what's on here  So I get some software and start reading it  and scan them  and it turns out it's a puzzle. There's a bunch of code  and I get some friends to help  and we crack the code  and then inside that is another code  and then there are some equations  and then we solve those equations  and then finally out pops a message from Google which is their official answer to my article  and it said   No comment.  And I love calculating these kinds of things  and it's not that I love doing the math. I do a lot of math  but I don't really like math for its own sake. What I love is that it lets you take some things that you know  and just by moving symbols around on a piece of paper  find out something that you didn't know that's very surprising. And I have a lot of stupid questions  and I love that math gives the power to answer them sometimes. And sometimes not. This is a question I got from a reader  an anonymous reader  and the subject line just said   Urgent   and this was the entire email   If people had wheels and could fly  how would we differentiate them from airplanes   Urgent.  Laughter  And I think there are some questions that math just cannot answer. Thank you. I'm assuming everyone here has watched a TED Talk online at one time or another  right  So what I'm going to do is play this. This is the song from the TED Talks online. And I'm going to slow it down because things sound cooler when they're slower. Ken Robinson  Good morning. How are you  Mark Applebaum  I'm going to    Kate Stone     mix some music. MA  I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story. Tod Machover  Something nobody's ever heard before. KS  I have a crossfader. Julian Treasure  I call this the mixer. KS  Two D.J. decks. Chris Anderson  You turn up the  dials  the wheel starts to turn. Dan Ellsey  I have always loved music. Michael Tilson Thomas  Is it a melody  or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude  Daniel Wolpert  Feeling everything  that's going on inside my body. Adam Ockelford  In your brain is  this amazing musical computer. MTT  Using computers and synthesizers to create  works. It's a language that's still evolving. And the   st century. KR  Turn on the radio. Pop into the discotheque. You will know what this person  is doing  moving to the music. Mark Ronson  This is my favorite part. MA  You gotta have doorstops. That's important. TM  We all love music a great deal. MTT  Anthems  dance crazes  ballads and marches. Kirby Ferguson and JT  The remix  It  is new music created from old music. Ryan Holladay  Blend seamlessly. Kathryn Schulz  And that's how it goes. MTT  What happens when the music stops  KS  Yay  MR  Obviously  I've been watching a lot of TED Talks. When I was first asked to speak at TED  I wasn't quite sure what my angle was  at first  so yeah  I immediately started watching tons of TED Talks  which is pretty much absolutely the worst thing that you can do because you start to go into panic mode  thinking  I haven't mounted a successful expedition to the North Pole yet. Neither have I provided electricity to my village through sheer ingenuity. In fact  I've pretty much wasted most of my life DJing in night clubs and producing pop records. But I still kept watching the videos  because I'm a masochist  and eventually  things like Michael Tilson Thomas and Tod Machover  and seeing their visceral passion talking about music  it definitely stirred something in me  and I'm a sucker for anyone talking devotedly about the power of music. And I started to write down on these little note cards every time I heard something that struck a chord in me  pardon the pun  or something that I thought I could use  and pretty soon  my studio looked like this  kind of like a John Nash   Beautiful Mind  vibe. The other good thing about watching TED Talks  when you see a really good one  you kind of all of a sudden wish the speaker was your best friend  don't you  Like  just for a day. They seem like a nice person. You'd take a bike ride  maybe share an ice cream. You'd certainly learn a lot. And every now and then they'd chide you  when they got frustrated that you couldn't really keep up with half of the technical things they're banging on about all the time. But then they'd remember that you're but a mere human of ordinary  mortal intelligence that didn't finish university  and they'd kind of forgive you  and pet you like the dog. Man  yeah  back to the real world  probably Sir Ken Robinson and I are not going to end up being best of friends. He lives all the way in L.A. and I imagine is quite busy  but through the tools available to me    technology and the innate way that I approach making music    I can sort of bully our existences into a shared event  which is sort of what you saw. I can hear something that I love in a piece of media and I can co opt it and insert myself in that narrative  or alter it  even. In a nutshell  that's what I was trying to do with these things  but more importantly  that's what the past    years of music has been. That's the major thread. See     years ago  you had the first digital samplers  and they changed everything overnight. All of a sudden  artists could sample from anything and everything that came before them  from a snare drum from the Funky Meters  to a Ron Carter bassline  the theme to  The Price Is Right.  Albums like De La Soul's    Feet High and Rising  and the Beastie Boys'  Paul's Boutique  looted from decades of recorded music to create these sonic  layered masterpieces that were basically the Sgt. Peppers of their day. And they weren't sampling these records because they were too lazy to write their own music. They weren't sampling these records to cash in on the familiarity of the original stuff. To be honest  it was all about sampling really obscure things  except for a few obvious exceptions like Vanilla Ice and  doo doo doo da da doo doo  that we know about. But the thing is  they were sampling those records because they heard something in that music that spoke to them that they instantly wanted to inject themselves into the narrative of that music. They heard it  they wanted to be a part of it  and all of a sudden they found themselves in possession of the technology to do so  not much unlike the way the Delta blues struck a chord with the Stones and the Beatles and Clapton  and they felt the need to co opt that music for the tools of their day. You know  in music we take something that we love and we build on it. I'd like to play a song for you. That's  La Di Da Di  and it's the fifth most sampled song of all time. It's been sampled     times. It was made in      by these two legends of hip hop  Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh  and the Ray Ban and Jheri curl look is so strong. I do hope that comes back soon. Anyway  this predated the sampling era. There were no samples in this record  although I did look up on the Internet last night  I mean several months ago  that  La Di Da Di  means  it's an old Cockney expression from the late     s in England  so maybe a remix with Mrs. Patmore from  Downton Abbey  coming soon  or that's for another day. Doug E. Fresh was the human beat box. Slick Rick is the voice you hear on the record  and because of Slick Rick's sing songy  super catchy vocals  it provides endless sound bites and samples for future pop records. That was     . This is me in       in case you were wondering how I was doing  thank you for asking. It's Throwback Thursday already. I was involved in a heavy love affair with the music of Duran Duran  as you can probably tell from my outfit. I was in the middle. And the simplest way that I knew how to co opt myself into that experience of wanting to be in that song somehow was to just get a band together of fellow nine year olds and play  Wild Boys  at the school talent show. So that's what we did  and long story short  we were booed off the stage  and if you ever have a chance to live your life escaping hearing the sound of an auditorium full of second  and third graders booing  I would highly recommend it. It's not really fun. But it didn't really matter  because what I wanted somehow was to just be in the history of that song for a minute. I didn't care who liked it. I just loved it  and I thought I could put myself in there. Over the next    years   La Di Da Di  continues to be sampled by countless records  ending up on massive hits like  Here Comes the Hotstepper  and  I Wanna Sex You Up.  Snoop Doggy Dogg covers this song on his debut album  Doggystyle  and calls it  Lodi Dodi.  Copyright lawyers are having a field day at this point. And then you fast forward to       and the Notorious B.I.G.  or Biggie  reinterprets  La Di Da Di  on his number one hit called  Hypnotize   which I will play a little bit of and I will play you a little bit of the Slick Rick to show you where they got it from. So Biggie was killed weeks before that song made it to number one  in one of the great tragedies of the hip hop era  but he would have been    years old and very much alive when  La Di Da Di  first came out  and as a young boy growing up in Brooklyn  it's hard not to think that that song probably held some fond memories for him. But the way he interpreted it  as you hear  is completely his own. He flips it  makes it  there's nothing pastiche whatsoever about it. It's thoroughly modern Biggie. I had to make that joke in this room  because you would be the only people that I'd ever have a chance of getting it. And so  it's a groaner.  Laughter  Elsewhere in the pop and rap world  we're going a little bit sample crazy. We're getting away from the obscure samples that we were doing  and all of a sudden everyone's taking these massive '  s tunes like Bowie   Let's Dance   and all these disco records  and just rapping on them. These records don't really age that well. You don't hear them now  because they borrowed from an era that was too steeped in its own connotation. You can't just hijack nostalgia wholesale. It leaves the listener feeling sickly. You have to take an element of those things and then bring something fresh and new to it  which was something that I learned when I was working with the late  amazing Amy Winehouse on her album  Back to Black.  A lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album that myself and Salaam Remi  the other producer  achieved  how we captured this long lost sound  but without the very  very   st century personality and firebrand that was Amy Winehouse and her lyrics about rehab and Roger Moore and even a mention of Slick Rick  the whole thing would have run the risk of being very pastiche  to be honest. Imagine any other singer from that era over it singing the same old lyrics. It runs a risk of being completely bland. I mean  there was no doubt that Amy and I and Salaam all had this love for this gospel  soul and blues and jazz that was evident listening to the musical arrangements. She brought the ingredients that made it urgent and of the time. So if we come all the way up to the present day now  the cultural tour de force that is Miley Cyrus  she reinterprets  La Di Da Di  completely for her generation  and we'll take a listen to the Slick Rick part and then see how she sort of flipped it. So Miley Cyrus  who wasn't even born yet when  La Di Da Di  was made  and neither were any of the co writers on the song  has found this song that somehow etched its way into the collective consciousness of pop music  and now  with its timeless playfulness of the original  has kind of translated to a whole new generation who will probably co opt it as their own. Since the dawn of the sampling era  there's been endless debate about the validity of music that contains samples. You know  the Grammy committee says that if your song contains some kind of pre written or pre existing music  you're ineligible for song of the year. Rockists  who are racist but only about rock music  constantly use the argument to   That's a real word. That is a real word. They constantly use the argument to devalue rap and modern pop  and these arguments completely miss the point  because the dam has burst. We live in the post sampling era. We take the things that we love and we build on them. That's just how it goes. And when we really add something significant and original and we merge our musical journey with this  then we have a chance to be a part of the evolution of that music that we love and be linked with it once it becomes something new again. So I would like to do one more piece that I put together for you tonight  and it takes place with two pretty inspiring TED performances that I've seen. One of them is the piano player Derek Paravicini  who happens to be a blind  autistic genius at the piano  and Emmanuel Jal  who is an ex child soldier from the South Sudan  who is a spoken word poet and rapper. And once again I found a way to annoyingly me me me myself into the musical history of these songs  but I can't help it  because they're these things that I love  and I want to mess around with them. So I hope you enjoy this. Here we go. Let's hear that TED sound again  right  Thank you very much. Thank you. So today's top chef class is in how to rob a bank  and it's clear that the general public needs guidance  because the average bank robbery nets only       dollars. Rank amateurs who know nothing about how to cook the books. The folks who know  of course  run our largest banks  and in the last go around  they cost us over    trillion dollars. That's what    trillion looks like. That's how many zeros  And cost us over    million jobs as well. So our task is to educate ourselves so that we can understand why we have these recurrent  intensifying financial crises  and how we can prevent them in the future. And the answer to that is that we have to stop epidemics of control fraud. Control fraud is what happens when the people who control  typically a CEO  a seemingly legitimate entity  use it as a weapon to defraud. And these are the weapons of mass destruction in the financial world. They also follow in finance a particular strategy  because the weapon of choice in finance is accounting  and there is a recipe for accounting control fraud  and how it occurs. And we discovered this recipe in quite an odd way that I'll come back to in a moment. First ingredient in the recipe  grow like crazy  second  by making or buying really crappy loans  but loans that are made at a very high interest rate or yield  three  while employing extreme leverage    that just means a lot of debt    compared to your equity  and four  while providing only trivial loss reserves against the inevitable losses. If you follow those four simple steps  and any bank can follow them  then you are mathematically guaranteed to have three things occur. The first thing is you will report record bank profits    not just high  record. Two  the CEO will immediately be made incredibly wealthy by modern executive compensation. And three  farther down the road  the bank will suffer catastrophic losses and will fail unless it is bailed out. And that's a hint as to how we discovered this recipe  because we discovered it through an autopsy process. During the savings and loan debacle in       we looked at every single failure  and we looked for common characteristics  and we discovered this recipe was common to each of these frauds. In other words  a coroner could find these things because this is a fatal recipe that will destroy the banks as well as the economy. And it also turns out to be precisely what could have stopped this crisis  the one that cost us    trillion dollars just in the household sector  that cost us    million jobs  was the easiest financial crisis by far to have avoided completely if we had simply learned the lessons of epidemics of control fraud  particularly using this recipe. So let's go to this crisis  and the two huge epidemics of loan origination fraud that drove the crisis    appraisal fraud and liar's loans    and what we're going to see in looking at both of these is we got warnings that were incredibly early about these frauds. We got warnings that we could have taken advantage of easily  because back in the savings and loan debacle  we had figured out how to respond and prevent these crises. And three  the warnings were unambiguous. They were obvious that what was going on was an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up. Let's take appraisal fraud first. This is simply where you inflate the value of the home that is being pledged as security for the loan. In       the year       that is over a year before Enron fails  by the way  the honest appraisers got together a formal petition begging the federal government to act  and the industry to act  to stop this epidemic of appraisal fraud. And the appraisers explained how it was occurring  that banks were demanding that appraisers inflate the appraisal  and that if the appraisers refused to do so  they  the banks  would blacklist honest appraisers and refuse to use them. Now  we've seen this before in the savings and loan debacle  and we know that this kind of fraud can only originate from the lenders  and that no honest lender would ever inflate the appraisal  because it's the great protection against loss. So this was an incredibly early warning      . It was something we'd seen before  and it was completely unambiguous. This was an epidemic of accounting control fraud led by the banks. What about liar's loans  Well  that warning actually comes earlier. The savings and loan debacle is basically the early     s through       and in the midst of fighting that wave of accounting control fraud  in       we found that a second front of fraud was being started. And like all good financial frauds in America  it began in Orange County  California. And we happened to be the regional regulators for it. And our examiners said  they are making loans without even checking what the borrower's income is. This is insane  it has to lead to massive losses  and it only makes sense for entities engaged in these accounting control frauds. And we said  yeah  you're absolutely right  and we drove those liar's loans out of the industry in      and       but we could only deal with the industry we had jurisdiction over  which was savings and loans  and so the biggest and the baddest of the frauds  Long Beach Savings  voluntarily gave up its federal savings and loan charter  gave up federal deposit insurance  converted to become a mortgage bank for the sole purpose of escaping our jurisdiction  and changed its name to Ameriquest  and became the most notorious of the liar's loans frauds early on  and to add to that  they deliberately predated upon minorities. So we knew again about this crisis. We'd seen it before. We'd stopped it before. We had incredibly early warnings of it  and it was absolutely unambiguous that no honest lender would make loans in this fashion. So let's take a look at the reaction of the industry and the regulators and the prosecutors to these clear early warnings that could have prevented the crisis. Start with the industry. The industry responded between      and      by increasing liar's loans by over     percent. These were the loans that hyperinflated the bubble and produced the economic crisis. By       half of all the loans called subprime were also liar's loans. They're not mutually exclusive  it's just that together  they're the most toxic combination you can possibly imagine. By          percent of all the loans made that year  all the home loans made that year  were liar's loans     percent. And this is despite a warning from the industry's own antifraud experts that said that these loans were an open invitation to fraudsters  and that they had a fraud incidence of    percent  nine zero. In response to that  the industry first started calling these loans liar's loans  which lacks a certain subtlety  and second  massively increased them  and no government regulator ever required or encouraged any lender to make a liar's loan or anyone to purchase a liar's loan  and that explicitly includes Fannie and Freddie. This came from the lenders because of the fraud recipe. What happened to appraisal fraud  It expanded remarkably as well. By       when a survey of appraisers was done     percent of appraisers reported that they had been subject to coercion from the lenders trying to get them to inflate an appraisal. In other words  both forms of fraud became absolutely endemic and normal  and this is what drove the bubble. What happened in the governmental sector  Well  the government  as I told you  when we were the savings and loan regulators  we could only deal with our industry  and if people gave up their federal deposit insurance  we couldn't do anything to them. Congress  it may strike you as impossible  but actually did something intelligent in       and passed the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act that gave the Fed  and only the Federal Reserve  the explicit  statutory authority to ban liar's loans by every lender  whether or not they had federal deposit insurance. So what did Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan  as chairs of the Fed  do when they got these warnings that these were massively fraudulent loans and that they were being sold to the secondary market  Remember  there's no fraud exorcist. Once it starts out a fraudulent loan  it can only be sold to the secondary market through more frauds  lying about the reps and warrantees  and then those people are going to produce mortgage backed securities and exotic derivatives which are also going to be supposedly backed by those fraudulent loans. So the fraud is going to progress through the entire system  hyperinflate the bubble  produce a disaster. And remember  we had experience with this. We had seen significant losses  and we had experience of competent regulators in stopping it. Greenspan and Bernanke refused to use the authority under the statute to stop liar's loans. And this was a matter first of dogma. They're just horrifically opposed to anything regulatory. But it is also the international competition in laxity  the race to the bottom between the United States and the United Kingdom  the city of London  in particular  and the city of London won that race to the bottom  but it meant that all regulation in the West was completely degraded in this stupid competition to be who could have the weakest regulation. So that was the regulatory response. What about the response of the prosecutors after the crisis  after    trillion dollars in losses  after    million jobs lost  a crisis in which the losses and the frauds were more than    times larger than the savings and loan debacle  Well  in the savings and loan debacle  our agency that regulated savings and loans  OTS  made over        criminal referrals  produced over       felony convictions just in cases designated as major  and that understates the degree of prioritization  because we worked with the FBI to create the list of the top     fraud schemes  the absolute worst of the worst  nationwide. Roughly     savings and loans involved  roughly     senior officials. Virtually all of them were prosecuted. We had a    percent conviction rate. It's the greatest success against elite white collar criminals ever  and it was because of this understanding of control fraud and the accounting control fraud mechanism. Flash forward to the current crisis. The same agency  Office of Thrift Supervision  which was supposed to regulate many of the largest makers of liar's loans in the country  has made  even today    it no longer exists  but as of a year ago  it had made zero criminal referrals. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  which is supposed to regulate the largest national banks  has made zero criminal referrals. The Fed appears to have made zero criminal referrals. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is smart enough to refuse to answer the question. Without any guidance from the regulators  there's no expertise in the FBI to investigate complex frauds. It isn't simply that they've had to reinvent the wheel of how to do these prosecutions  they've forgotten that the wheel exists  and therefore  we have zero prosecutions  and of course  zero convictions  of any of the elite bank frauds  the Wall Street types  that drove this crisis. With no expertise coming from the regulators  the FBI formed what it calls a partnership with the Mortgage Bankers Association in     . The Mortgage Bankers Association is the trade association of the perps. And the Mortgage Bankers Association set out  it had the audacity and the success to con the FBI. It had created a supposed definition of mortgage fraud  in which  guess what  its members are always the victim and never the perpetrators. And the FBI has bought this hook  line  sinker  rod  reel and the boat they rode out in. And so the FBI  under the leadership of an attorney general who is African American and a president of the United States who is African American  have adopted the Tea Party definition of the crisis  in which it is the first virgin crisis in history  conceived without sin in the executive ranks. And it's those oh so clever hairdressers who were able to defraud the poor  pitiful banks  who lack any financial sophistication. It is the silliest story you can conceive of  and so they go and they prosecute the hairdressers  and they leave the banksters alone entirely. And so  while lions are roaming the campsite  the FBI is chasing mice. What do we need to do  What can we do in all of this  We need to change the perverse incentive structures that produce these recurrent epidemics of accounting control fraud that are driving our crises. So we have to first get rid of the systemically dangerous institutions. These are the so called too big to fail institutions. We need to shrink them to the point  within the next five years  that they no longer pose a systemic risk. Right now  they are ticking time bombs that will cause a global crisis as soon as the next one fails    not if  when. Second thing we need to do is completely reform modern executive and professional compensation  which is what they use to suborn the appraisers. Remember  they were pressuring the appraisers through the compensation system  trying to produce what we call a Gresham's dynamic  in which bad ethics drives good ethics out of the marketplace. And they largely succeeded  which is how the fraud became endemic. And the third thing that we need to do is deal with what we call the three D's  deregulation  desupervision  and the de facto decriminalization. Because we can make all three of these changes  and if we do so  we can dramatically reduce how often we have a crisis and how severe those crises are. That is not simply critical to our economy. You can see what these crises do to inequality and what they do to our democracy. They have produced crony capitalism  American style  in which the largest financial institutions are the leading financial donors of both parties  and that's the reason why even after this crisis     times larger than the savings and loan crisis  we have no meaningful reforms in any of the three areas that I've talked about  other than banning liar's loans  which is good  but that's just one form of ammunition for this fraud weapon. There are many forms of ammunition they can use. That's why we need to learn what the bankers have learned  the recipe for the best way to rob a bank  so that we can stop that recipe  because our legislators  who are dependent on political contributions  will not do it on their own. Thank you very much. I study ants in the desert  in the tropical forest and in my kitchen  and in the hills around Silicon Valley where I live. I've recently realized that ants are using interactions differently in different environments  and that got me thinking that we could learn from this about other systems  like brains and data networks that we engineer  and even cancer. So what all these systems have in common is that there's no central control. An ant colony consists of sterile female workers    those are the ants you see walking around   and then one or more reproductive females who just lay the eggs. They don't give any instructions. Even though they're called queens  they don't tell anybody what to do. So in an ant colony  there's no one in charge  and all systems like this without central control are regulated using very simple interactions. Ants interact using smell. They smell with their antennae  and they interact with their antennae  so when one ant touches another with its antennae  it can tell  for example  if the other ant is a nestmate and what task that other ant has been doing. So here you see a lot of ants moving around and interacting in a lab arena that's connected by tubes to two other arenas. So when one ant meets another  it doesn't matter which ant it meets  and they're actually not transmitting any kind of complicated signal or message. All that matters to the ant is the rate at which it meets other ants. And all of these interactions  taken together  produce a network. So this is the network of the ants that you just saw moving around in the arena  and it's this constantly shifting network that produces the behavior of the colony  like whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest  or how many are going out to forage. A brain actually works in the same way  but what's great about ants is that you can see the whole network as it happens. There are more than        species of ants  in every conceivable environment  and they're using interactions differently to meet different environmental challenges. So one important environmental challenge that every system has to deal with is operating costs  just what it takes to run the system. And another environmental challenge is resources  finding them and collecting them. In the desert  operating costs are high because water is scarce  and the seed eating ants that I study in the desert have to spend water to get water. So an ant outside foraging  searching for seeds in the hot sun  just loses water into the air. But the colony gets its water by metabolizing the fats out of the seeds that they eat. So in this environment  interactions are used to activate foraging. An outgoing forager doesn't go out unless it gets enough interactions with returning foragers  and what you see are the returning foragers going into the tunnel  into the nest  and meeting outgoing foragers on their way out. This makes sense for the ant colony  because the more food there is out there  the more quickly the foragers find it  the faster they come back  and the more foragers they send out. The system works to stay stopped  unless something positive happens. So interactions function to activate foragers. And we've been studying the evolution of this system. First of all  there's variation. It turns out that colonies are different. On dry days  some colonies forage less  so colonies are different in how they manage this trade off between spending water to search for seeds and getting water back in the form of seeds. And we're trying to understand why some colonies forage less than others by thinking about ants as neurons  using models from neuroscience. So just as a neuron adds up its stimulation from other neurons to decide whether to fire  an ant adds up its stimulation from other ants to decide whether to forage. And what we're looking for is whether there might be small differences among colonies in how many interactions each ant needs before it's willing to go out and forage  because a colony like that would forage less. And this raises an analogous question about brains. We talk about the brain  but of course every brain is slightly different  and maybe there are some individuals or some conditions in which the electrical properties of neurons are such that they require more stimulus to fire  and that would lead to differences in brain function. So in order to ask evolutionary questions  we need to know about reproductive success. This is a map of the study site where I have been tracking this population of harvester ant colonies for    years  which is about as long as a colony lives. Each symbol is a colony  and the size of the symbol is how many offspring it had  because we were able to use genetic variation to match up parent and offspring colonies  that is  to figure out which colonies were founded by a daughter queen produced by which parent colony. And this was amazing for me  after all these years  to find out  for example  that colony      whom I've known well for many years  is a great grandmother. Here's her daughter colony  here's her granddaughter colony  and these are her great granddaughter colonies. And by doing this  I was able to learn that offspring colonies resemble parent colonies in their decisions about which days are so hot that they don't forage  and the offspring of parent colonies live so far from each other that the ants never meet  so the ants of the offspring colony can't be learning this from the parent colony. And so our next step is to look for the genetic variation underlying this resemblance. So then I was able to ask  okay  who's doing better  Over the time of the study  and especially in the past    years  there's been a very severe and deepening drought in the Southwestern U.S.  and it turns out that the colonies that conserve water  that stay in when it's really hot outside  and thus sacrifice getting as much food as possible  are the ones more likely to have offspring colonies. So all this time  I thought that colony     was a loser  because on really dry days  there'd be just this trickle of foraging  while the other colonies were out foraging  getting lots of food  but in fact  colony     is a huge success. She's a matriarch. She's one of the rare great grandmothers on the site. To my knowledge  this is the first time that we've been able to track the ongoing evolution of collective behavior in a natural population of animals and find out what's actually working best. Now  the Internet uses an algorithm to regulate the flow of data that's very similar to the one that the harvester ants are using to regulate the flow of foragers. And guess what we call this analogy  The anternet is coming. So data doesn't leave the source computer unless it gets a signal that there's enough bandwidth for it to travel on. In the early days of the Internet  when operating costs were really high and it was really important not to lose any data  then the system was set up for interactions to activate the flow of data. It's interesting that the ants are using an algorithm that's so similar to the one that we recently invented  but this is only one of a handful of ant algorithms that we know about  and ants have had     million years to evolve a lot of good ones  and I think it's very likely that some of the other        species are going to have interesting algorithms for data networks that we haven't even thought of yet. So what happens when operating costs are low  Operating costs are low in the tropics  because it's very humid  and it's easy for the ants to be outside walking around. But the ants are so abundant and diverse in the tropics that there's a lot of competition. Whatever resource one species is using  another species is likely to be using that at the same time. So in this environment  interactions are used in the opposite way. The system keeps going unless something negative happens  and one species that I study makes circuits in the trees of foraging ants going from the nest to a food source and back  just round and round  unless something negative happens  like an interaction with ants of another species. So here's an example of ant security. In the middle  there's an ant plugging the nest entrance with its head in response to interactions with another species. Those are the little ones running around with their abdomens up in the air. But as soon as the threat is passed  the entrance is open again  and maybe there are situations in computer security where operating costs are low enough that we could just block access temporarily in response to an immediate threat  and then open it again  instead of trying to build a permanent firewall or fortress. So another environmental challenge that all systems have to deal with is resources  finding and collecting them. And to do this  ants solve the problem of collective search  and this is a problem that's of great interest right now in robotics  because we've understood that  rather than sending a single  sophisticated  expensive robot out to explore another planet or to search a burning building  that instead  it may be more effective to get a group of cheaper robots exchanging only minimal information  and that's the way that ants do it. So the invasive Argentine ant makes expandable search networks. They're good at dealing with the main problem of collective search  which is the trade off between searching very thoroughly and covering a lot of ground. And what they do is  when there are many ants in a small space  then each one can search very thoroughly because there will be another ant nearby searching over there  but when there are a few ants in a large space  then they need to stretch out their paths to cover more ground. I think they use interactions to assess density  so when they're really crowded  they meet more often  and they search more thoroughly. Different ant species must use different algorithms  because they've evolved to deal with different resources  and it could be really useful to know about this  and so we recently asked ants to solve the collective search problem in the extreme environment of microgravity in the International Space Station. When I first saw this picture  I thought  Oh no  they've mounted the habitat vertically  but then I realized that  of course  it doesn't matter. So the idea here is that the ants are working so hard to hang on to the wall or the floor or whatever you call it that they're less likely to interact  and so the relationship between how crowded they are and how often they meet would be messed up. We're still analyzing the data. I don't have the results yet. But it would be interesting to know how other species solve this problem in different environments on Earth  and so we're setting up a program to encourage kids around the world to try this experiment with different species. It's very simple. It can be done with cheap materials. And that way  we could make a global map of ant collective search algorithms. And I think it's pretty likely that the invasive species  the ones that come into our buildings  are going to be really good at this  because they're in your kitchen because they're really good at finding food and water. So the most familiar resource for ants is a picnic  and this is a clustered resource. When there's one piece of fruit  there's likely to be another piece of fruit nearby  and the ants that specialize on clustered resources use interactions for recruitment. So when one ant meets another  or when it meets a chemical deposited on the ground by another  then it changes direction to follow in the direction of the interaction  and that's how you get the trail of ants sharing your picnic. Now this is a place where I think we might be able to learn something from ants about cancer. I mean  first  it's obvious that we could do a lot to prevent cancer by not allowing people to spread around or sell the toxins that promote the evolution of cancer in our bodies  but I don't think the ants can help us much with this because ants never poison their own colonies. But we might be able to learn something from ants about treating cancer. There are many different kinds of cancer. Each one originates in a particular part of the body  and then some kinds of cancer will spread or metastasize to particular other tissues where they must be getting resources that they need. So if you think from the perspective of early metastatic cancer cells as they're out searching around for the resources that they need  if those resources are clustered  they're likely to use interactions for recruitment  and if we can figure out how cancer cells are recruiting  then maybe we could set traps to catch them before they become established. So ants are using interactions in different ways in a huge variety of environments  and we could learn from this about other systems that operate without central control. Using only simple interactions  ant colonies have been performing amazing feats for more than     million years. We have a lot to learn from them. Thank you. I recently retired from the California Highway Patrol after    years of service. The majority of those    years was spent patrolling the southern end of Marin County  which includes the Golden Gate Bridge. The bridge is an iconic structure  known worldwide for its beautiful views of San Francisco  the Pacific Ocean  and its inspiring architecture. Unfortunately  it is also a magnet for suicide  being one of the most utilized sites in the world. The Golden Gate Bridge opened in     . Joseph Strauss  chief engineer in charge of building the bridge  was quoted as saying   The bridge is practically suicide proof. Suicide from the bridge is neither practical nor probable.  But since its opening  over       people have leapt to their death from that bridge. Some believe that traveling between the two towers will lead you to another dimension    this bridge has been romanticized as such   that the fall from that frees you from all your worries and grief  and the waters below will cleanse your soul. But let me tell you what actually occurs when the bridge is used as a means of suicide. After a free fall of four to five seconds  the body strikes the water at about    miles an hour. That impact shatters bones  some of which then puncture vital organs. Most die on impact. Those that don't generally flail in the water helplessly  and then drown. I don't think that those who contemplate this method of suicide realize how grisly a death that they will face. This is the cord. Except for around the two towers  there is    inches of steel paralleling the bridge. This is where most folks stand before taking their lives. I can tell you from experience that once the person is on that cord  and at their darkest time  it is very difficult to bring them back. I took this photo last year as this young woman spoke to an officer contemplating her life. I want to tell you very happily that we were successful that day in getting her back over the rail. When I first began working on the bridge  we had no formal training. You struggled to funnel your way through these calls. This was not only a disservice to those contemplating suicide  but to the officers as well. We've come a long  long way since then. Now  veteran officers and psychologists train new officers. This is Jason Garber. I met Jason on July    of last year when I get received a call of a possible suicidal subject sitting on the cord near midspan. I responded  and when I arrived  I observed Jason speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer. Jason was just    years old and had flown out here from New Jersey. As a matter of fact  he had flown out here on two other occasions from New Jersey to attempt suicide on this bridge. After about an hour of speaking with Jason  he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box. Recalling your Greek mythology  Zeus created Pandora  and sent her down to Earth with a box  and told her   Never  ever open that box.  Well one day  curiosity got the better of Pandora  and she did open the box. Out flew plagues  sorrows  and all sorts of evils against man. The only good thing in the box was hope. Jason then asked us   What happens when you open the box and hope isn't there   He paused a few moments  leaned to his right  and was gone. This kind  intelligent young man from New Jersey had just committed suicide. I spoke with Jason's parents that evening  and I suppose that  when I was speaking with them  that I didn't sound as if I was doing very well  because that very next day  their family rabbi called to check on me. Jason's parents had asked him to do so. The collateral damage of suicide affects so many people. I pose these questions to you  What would you do if your family member  friend or loved one was suicidal  What would you say  Would you know what to say  In my experience  it's not just the talking that you do  but the listening. Listen to understand. Don't argue  blame  or tell the person you know how they feel  because you probably don't. By just being there  you may just be the turning point that they need. If you think someone is suicidal  don't be afraid to confront them and ask the question. One way of asking them the question is like this   Others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life  have you had these thoughts   Confronting the person head on may just save their life and be the turning point for them. Some other signs to look for  hopelessness  believing that things are terrible and never going to get better  helplessness  believing that there is nothing that you can do about it  recent social withdrawal  and a loss of interest in life. I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago  and I received an email from a lady that I'd like to read you her letter. She lost her son on January    of this year  and she wrote this me this email just a couple of days ago  and it's with her permission and blessing that I read this to you.  Hi  Kevin. I imagine you're at the TED Conference. That must be quite the experience to be there. I'm thinking I should go walk the bridge this weekend. Just wanted to drop you a note. Hope you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends  etc. I'm still pretty numb  but noticing more moments of really realizing Mike isn't coming home. Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco to watch the   ers game with his father on January   . He never made it there. I called Petaluma police and reported him missing that evening. The next morning  two officers came to my home and reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge. A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge at      p.m. the previous day. Thanks so much for standing up for those who may be only temporarily too weak to stand for themselves. Who hasn't been low before without suffering from a true mental illness  It shouldn't be so easy to end it. My prayers are with you for your fight. The GGB  Golden Gate Bridge  is supposed to be a passage across our beautiful bay  not a graveyard. Good luck this week. Vicky.  I can't imagine the courage it takes for her to go down to that bridge and walk the path that her son took that day  and also the courage just to carry on. I'd like to introduce you to a man I refer to as hope and courage. On March    of       I responded to a radio call of a possible suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk near the north tower. I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk and observed this man  Kevin Berthia  standing on the sidewalk. When he saw me  he immediately traversed that pedestrian rail  and stood on that small pipe which goes around the tower. For the next hour and a half  I listened as Kevin spoke about his depression and hopelessness. Kevin decided on his own that day to come back over that rail and give life another chance. When Kevin came back over  I congratulated him.  This is a new beginning  a new life.  But I asked him   What was it that made you come back and give hope and life another chance   And you know what he told me  He said   You listened. You let me speak  and you just listened.  Shortly after this incident  I received a letter from Kevin's mother  and I have that letter with me  and I'd like to read it to you.  Dear Mr. Briggs  Nothing will erase the events of March     but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us. I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help. He has been diagnosed with a mental illness for which he has been properly medicated. I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old  completely unaware of any hereditary traits  but  thank God  now we know. Kevin is straight  as he says. We truly thank God for you. Sincerely indebted to you  Narvella Berthia.  And on the bottom she writes   P.S. When I visited San Francisco General Hospital that evening  you were listed as the patient. Boy  did I have to straighten that one out.  Today  Kevin is a loving father and contributing member of society. He speaks openly about the events that day and his depression in the hopes that his story will inspire others. Suicide is not just something I've encountered on the job. It's personal. My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning. That act  although ending his own pain  robbed me from ever getting to know him. This is what suicide does. For most suicidal folks  or those contemplating suicide  they wouldn't think of hurting another person. They just want their own pain to end. Typically  this is accomplished in just three ways  sleep  drugs or alcohol  or death. In my career  I've responded to and been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge. Of those incidents I've been directly involved with  I've only lost two  but that's two too many. One was Jason. The other was a man I spoke to for about an hour. During that time  he shook my hand on three occasions. On that final handshake  he looked at me  and he said   Kevin  I'm sorry  but I have to go.  And he leapt. Horrible  absolutely horrible. I do want to tell you  though  the vast majority of folks that we do get to contact on that bridge do not commit suicide. Additionally  that very few who have jumped off the bridge and lived and can talk about it  that one to two percent  most of those folks have said that the second that they let go of that rail  they knew that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live. I tell people  the bridge not only connects Marin to San Francisco  but people together also. That connection  or bridge that we make  is something that each and every one of us should strive to do. Suicide is preventable. There is help. There is hope. Thank you very much.  Pheromone  is a very powerful word. It conjures up sex  abandon  loss of control  and you can see  it's very important as a word. But it's only    years old. It was invented in     . Now  if you put that word into the web  as you may have done  you'll come up with millions of hits  and almost all of those sites are trying to sell you something to make you irresistible for    dollars or more. Now  this is a very attractive idea  and the molecules they mention sound really science y. They've got lots of syllables. It's things like androstenol  androstenone or androstadienone. It gets better and better  and when you combine that with white lab coats  you must imagine that there is fantastic science behind this. But sadly  these are fraudulent claims supported by dodgy science. The problem is that  although there are many good scientists working on what they think are human pheromones  and they're publishing in respectable journals  at the basis of this  despite very sophisticated experiments  there really is no good science behind it  because it's based on a problem  which is nobody has systematically gone through all the odors that humans produce    and there are thousands of molecules that we give off. We're mammals. We produce a lot of smell. Nobody has gone through systematically to work out which molecules really are pheromones. They've just plucked a few  and all these experiments are based on those  but there's no good evidence at all. Now  that's not to say that smell is not important to people. It is  and some people are real enthusiasts  and one of these was Napoleon. And famously  you may remember that out on the campaign trail for war  he wrote to his lover  Empress Josephine  saying   Don't wash. I'm coming home.  So he didn't want to lose any of her richness in the days before he'd get home  and it is still  you'll find websites that offer this as a major quirk. At the same time  though  we spend about as much money taking the smells off us as putting them back on in perfumes  and perfumes are a multi billion dollar business. So what I want to do in the rest of this talk is tell you about what pheromones really are  tell you why I think we would expect humans to have pheromones  tell you about some of the confusions in pheromones  and then finally  I want to end with a promising avenue which shows us the way we ought to be going. So the ancient Greeks knew that dogs sent invisible signals between each other. A female dog in heat sent an invisible signal to male dogs for miles around  and it wasn't a sound  it was a smell. You could take the smell from the female dog  and the dogs would chase the cloth. But the problem for everybody who could see this effect was that you couldn't identify the molecules. You couldn't demonstrate it was chemical. The reason for that  of course  is that each of these animals produces tiny quantities  and in the case of the dog  males dogs can smell it  but we can't smell it. And it was only in      that a German team  after spending    years in search of these molecules  discovered  identified  the first pheromone  and this was the sex pheromone of a silk moth. Now  this was an inspired choice  by Adolf Butenandt and his team  because he needed half a million moths to get enough material to do the chemical analysis. But he created the model for how you should go about pheromone analysis. He basically went through systematically  showing that only the molecule in question was the one that stimulated the males  not all the others. He analyzed it very carefully. He synthesized the molecule  and then tried the synthesized molecule on the males and got them to respond and showed it was  indeed  that molecule. That's closing the circle. That's the thing which has never been done with humans  nothing systematic  no real demonstration. With that new concept  we needed a new word  and that was the word  pheromone   and it's basically transferred excitement  transferred between individuals  and since       pheromones have been found right the way across the animal kingdom  in male animals  in female animals. It works just as well underwater for goldfish and lobsters. And almost every mammal you can think of has had a pheromone identified  and of course  an enormous number of insects. So we know that pheromones exist right the way across the animal kingdom. What about humans  Well  the first thing  of course  is that we're mammals  and mammals are smelly. As any dog owner can tell you  we smell  they smell. But the real reason we might think that humans have pheromones is the change that occurs as we grow up. The smell of a room of teenagers is quite different from the smell of a room of small children. What's changed  And of course  it's puberty. Along with the pubic hair and the hair in the armpits  new glands start to secrete in those places  and that's what's making the change in smell. If we were any other kind of mammal  or any other kind of animal  we would say   That must be something to do with pheromones   and we'd start looking properly. But there are some problems  and this is why  I think  people have not looked for pheromones so effectively in humans. There are  indeed  problems. And the first of these is perhaps surprising. It's all about culture. Now moths don't learn a lot about what is good to smell  but humans do  and up to the age of about four  any smell  no matter how rancid  is simply interesting. And I understand that the major role of parents is to stop kids putting their fingers in poo  because it's always something nice to smell. But gradually we learn what's not good  and one of the things we learn at the same time as what is not good is what is good. Now  the cheese behind me is a British  if not an English  delicacy. It's ripe blue Stilton. Liking it is incomprehensible to people from other countries. Every culture has its own special food and national delicacy. If you were to come from Iceland  your national dish is deep rotted shark. Now  all of these things are acquired tastes  but they form almost a badge of identity. You're part of the in group. The second thing is the sense of smell. Each of us has a unique odor world  in the sense that what we smell  we each smell a completely different world. Now  smell was the hardest of the senses to crack  and the Nobel Prize awarded to Richard Axel and Linda Buck was only awarded in      for their discovery of how smell works. It's really hard  but in essence  nerves from the brain go up into the nose and on these nerves exposed in the nose to the outside air are receptors  and odor molecules coming in on a sniff interact with these receptors  and if they bond  they send the nerve a signal which goes back into the brain. We don't just have one kind of receptor. If you're a human  you have about     different kinds of receptors  and the brain knows what you're smelling because of the combination of receptors and nerve cells that they trigger  sending messages up to the brain in a combinatorial fashion. But it's a bit more complicated  because each of those     comes in various variants  and depending which variant you have  you might smell coriander  or cilantro  that herb  either as something delicious and savory or something like soap. So we each have an individual world of smell  and that complicates anything when we're studying smell. Well  we really ought to talk about armpits  and I have to say that I do have particularly good ones. Now  I'm not going to share them with you  but this is the place that most people have looked for pheromones. There is one good reason  which is  the great apes have armpits as their unique characteristic. The other primates have scent glands in other parts of the body. The great apes have these armpits full of secretory glands producing smells all the time  enormous numbers of molecules. When they're secreted from the glands  the molecules are odorless. They have no smell at all  and it's only the wonderful bacteria growing on the rainforest of hair that actually produces the smells that we know and love. And so incidentally  if you want to reduce the amount of smell  clear cutting your armpits is a very effective way of reducing the habitat for bacteria  and you'll find they remain less smelly for much longer. But although we've focused on armpits  I think it's partly because they're the least embarrassing place to go and ask people for samples. There is actually another reason why we might not be looking for a universal sex pheromone there  and that's because    percent of the world's population doesn't have smelly armpits like me. And these are people from China  Japan  Korea  and other parts of northeast Asia. They simply don't secrete those odorless precursors that the bacteria love to use to produce the smells that in an ethnocentric way we always thought of as characteristic of armpits. So it doesn't apply to    percent of the world. So what should we be doing in our search for human pheromones  I'm fairly convinced that we do have them. We're mammals  like everybody else who's a mammal  and we probably do have them. But what I think we should do is go right back to the beginning  and basically look all over the body. No matter how embarrassing  we need to search and go for the first time where no one else has dared tread. It's going to be difficult  it's going to be embarrassing  but we need to look. We also need to go back to the ideas that Butenandt used when he was studying the silk moth. We need to go back and look systematically at all the molecules that are being produced  and work out which ones are really involved. It isn't good enough simply to pluck a couple and say   They'll do.  We have to actually demonstrate that they really have the effects we claim. There is one team that I'm actually very impressed by. They're in France  and their previous success was identifying the rabbit mammary pheromone. They've turned their attention now to human babies and mothers. So this is a baby having a drink of milk from its mother's breast. Her nipple is completely hidden by the baby's head  but what you'll notice is a white droplet with an arrow pointing to it  and that's the secretion from the areolar glands. Now  we all have them  men and women  and these are the little bumps around the nipple  and if you're a lactating woman  these start to secrete. It's a very interesting secretion. What Benoist Schaal and his team developed was a simple test to investigate what the effect of this secretion might be  in effect  a simple bioassay. So this is a sleeping baby  and under its nose  we've put a clean glass rod. The baby remains sleeping  showing no interest at all. But if we go to any mother who is secreting from the areolar glands  so it's not about recognition  it can be from any mother  if we take the secretion and now put it under the baby's nose  we get a very different reaction. It's a connoisseur's reaction of delight  and it opens its mouth and sticks out its tongue and starts to suck. Now  since this is from any mother  it could really be a pheromone. It's not about individual recognition. Any mother will do. Now  why is this important  apart from being simply very interesting  It's because women vary in the number of areolar glands that they have  and there is a correlation between the ease with which babies start to suckle and the number of areolar glands she has. It appears that the more secretions she's got  the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly. If you're a mammal  the most dangerous time in life is the first few hours after birth. You have to get that first drink of milk  and if you don't get it  you won't survive. You'll be dead. Since many babies actually find it difficult to take that first meal  because they're not getting the right stimulus  if we could identify what that molecule was  and the French team are being very cautious  but if we could identify the molecule  synthesize it  it would then mean premature babies would be more likely to suckle  and every baby would have a better chance of survival. So what I want to argue is this is one example of where a systematic  really scientific approach can actually bring you a real understanding of pheromones. There could be all sorts of medical interventions. There could be all sorts of things that humans are doing with pheromones that we simply don't know at the moment. What we need to remember is pheromones are not just about sex. They're about all sorts of things to do with a mammal's life. So do go forward and do search for more. There's lots to find. Thank you very much. The most romantic thing to ever happen to me online started out the way most things do  without me  and not online. On December           the man on the medal  Alfred Nobel  died. One hundred years later  exactly  actually  December           this charming lady  Wislawa Szymborska  won the Nobel Prize for literature. She's a Polish poet. She's a big deal  obviously  but back in '    I thought I had never heard of her  and when I checked out her work  I found this sweet little poem   Four in the Morning.   The hour from night to day. The hour from side to side. The hour for those past thirty...  And it goes on  but as soon as I read this poem  I fell for it hard  so hard  I suspected we must have met somewhere before. Had I shared an elevator ride with this poem  Did I flirt with this poem in a coffee shop somewhere  I could not place it  and it bugged me  and then in the coming week or two  I would just be watching an old movie  and this would happen. We didn't get home till around four in the morning. Rives  My roommates would have the TV on  and this would happen. watching that Omen trilogy. Rives  I would be listening to music  and this would happen. Rives  So you can see what was going on  right  Obviously  the demigods of coincidence were just messing with me. Some people get a number stuck in their head  you may recognize a certain name or a tune  some people get nothing  but four in the morning was in me now  but mildly  like a groin injury. I always assumed it would just go away on its own eventually  and I never talked about it with anybody  but it did not  and I totally did. In       I was invited to speak at TED for the second time  and since I was still an authority on nothing  I thought  what if I made a multimedia presentation on a topic so niche it is actually inconsequential or actually cockamamie. So my talk had some of my four in the morning examples  but it also had examples from my fellow TED speakers that year. I found four in the morning in a novel by Isabel Allende. I found a really great one in the autobiography of Bill Clinton. I found a couple in the work of Matt Groening  although Matt Groening told me later that he could not make my talk because it was a morning session and I gather that he is not an early riser. However  had Matt been there  he would have seen this mock conspiracy theory that was un freaking canny for me to assemble. It was totally contrived just for that room  just for that moment. That's how we did it in the pre TED.com days. It was fun. That was pretty much it. When I got home  though  the emails started coming in from people who had seen the talk live  beginning with  and this is still my favorite   Here's another one for your collection  'It's the friends you can call up at   a.m. that matter.'  The sentiment is Marlene Dietrich. The email itself was from another very sexy European type  TED Curator Chris Anderson. Chris found this quote on a coffee cup or something  and I'm thinking  this man is the Typhoid Mary of ideas worth spreading  and I have infected him. I am contagious  which was confirmed less than a week later when a Hallmark employee scanned and sent an actual greeting card with that same quotation. As a bonus  she hooked me up with a second one they make. It says   Just knowing I can call you at four in the morning if I need to makes me not really need to   which I love  because together these are like   Hallmark  When you care enough to send the very best twice  phrased slightly differently.  I was not surprised at the TEDster and New Yorker magazine overlap. A bunch of people sent me this when it came out.  It's   a.m. maybe you'd sleep better if you bought some crap.  I was surprised at the TEDster  Rugrats  overlap. More than one person sent me this. Why on Earth are you making chocolate pudding  Stu Pickles  Because I've lost control of my life. Rives  And then there was the lone TEDster who was disgruntled I had overlooked what he considers to be a classic. Roy  No  it's not an accident. You wanted to get out of the house anyway  right  Ronnie  Not at four o'clock in the morning. Rives  So that's  Close Encounters   and the main character is all worked up because aliens  momentously  have chosen to show themselves to earthlings at four in the morning  which does make that a very solid example. Those were all really solid examples. They did not get me any closer to understanding why I thought I recognized this one particular poem. But they followed the pattern. They played along. Right  Four in the morning as this scapegoat hour when all these dramatic occurrences allegedly occur. Maybe this was some kind of cliche that had never been taxonomized before. Maybe I was on the trail of a new meme or something. Just when things were getting pretty interesting  things got really interesting. TED.com launched  later that year  with a bunch of videos from past talks  including mine  and I started receiving  four in the morning  citations from what seemed like every time zone on the planet. Much of it was content I never would have found on my own if I was looking for it  and I was not. I don't know anybody with juvenile diabetes. I probably would have missed the booklet   Grilled Cheese at Four O'Clock in the Morning.  I do not subscribe to Crochet Today  magazine  although it looks delightful.  Laughter  Take note of those clock ends. This is a college student's suggestion for what a  four in the morning  gang sign should look like. People sent me magazine ads. They took photographs in grocery stores. I got a ton of graphic novels and comics. A lot of good quality work  too   The Sandman    Watchmen.  There's a very cute example here from  Calvin and Hobbes.  In fact  the oldest citation anybody sent in was from a cartoon from the Stone Age. Take a look. Fred Flintstone  Like at   a.m.  that's how early. Rives  And the flip side of the timeline  this is from the   st century. A thousand years from now  people are still doing this. Rives  It shows the spectrum. I received so many songs  TV shows  movies  like from dismal to famous  I could give you a four hour playlist. If I just stick to modern male movie stars  I keep it to the length of about a commercial. Here's your sampler. Rives  So somewhere along the line  I realized I have a hobby I didn't know I wanted  and it is crowdsourced. But I was also thinking what you might be thinking  which is really  couldn't you do this with any hour of the day  First of all  you are not getting clips like that about four in the afternoon. Secondly  I did a little research. You know  I was kind of interested. If this is confirmation bias  there is so much confirmation  I am biased. Literature probably shows it best. There are a couple three in the mornings in Shakespeare. There's a five in the morning. There are seven four in the mornings  and they're all very dire. In  Measure for Measure   it's the call time for the executioner. Tolstoy gives Napoleon insomnia at four in the morning right before battle in  War and Peace.  Charlotte Bront 's  Jane Eyre  has got kind of a pivotal four in the morning  as does Emily Bront 's  Wuthering Heights.   Lolita  has as a creepy four in the morning.  Huckleberry Finn  has one in dialect. Someone sent in H.G. Wells'  The Invisible Man.  Someone else sent in Ralph Ellison's  Invisible Man.   The Great Gatsby  spends the last four in the morning of his life waiting for a lover who never shows  and the most famous wake up in literature  perhaps   The Metamorphosis.  First paragraph  the main character wakes up transformed into a giant cockroach  but we already know  cockroach notwithstanding  something is up with this guy. Why  His alarm is set for four o'clock in the morning. What kind of person would do that  This kind of person would do that. But of course  there is no news yet. Everyone's still asleep in their comfy  comfy beds. Rives  Exactly. So that's Lucy from the Peanuts   Mommie Dearest   Rocky  first day of training  Nelson Mandela  first day in office  and Bart Simpson  which combined with a cockroach would give you one hell of a dinner party and gives me yet another category  people waking up  in my big old database. Just imagine that your friends and your family have heard that you collect  say  stuffed polar bears  and they send them to you. Even if you don't really  at a certain point  you totally collect stuffed polar bears  and your collection is probably pretty kick ass. And when I got to that point  I embraced it. I got my curator on. I started fact checking  downloading  illegally screen grabbing. I started archiving. My hobby had become a habit  and my habit gave me possibly the world's most eclectic Netflix queue. At one point  it went   Guys and Dolls  The Musical    Last Tango in Paris    Diary of a Wimpy Kid    Porn Star  Legend of Ron Jeremy.  Why  Porn Star  Legend of Ron Jeremy   Because someone told me I would find this clip in there. in Flushing  Queens on March            at four o'clock in the morning. Rives  Of course he was.  Laughter   Applause  Yeah. Not only does it seem to make sense  it also answers the question   What do Ron Jeremy and Simone de Beauvoir have in common   Simone de Beauvoir begins her entire autobiography with the sentence   I was born at four o'clock in the morning   which I had because someone else had emailed it to me  and when they did  I had another bump up in my entry for this  because porn star Ron Jeremy and feminist Simone de Beauvoir are not just different people. They are different people that have this thing connecting them  and I did not know if that is trivia or knowledge or inadvertent expertise  but I did wonder  is there maybe a cooler way to do this  So last October  in gentleman scholar tradition  I put the entire collection online as  Museum of Four in the Morning.  You can click on that red  refresh  button. It will take you at random to one of hundreds of snippets that are in the collection. Here is a knockout poem by Billy Collins called  Forgetfulness.  in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war. No wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem that you used to know by heart. Rives  So the first hour of this project was satisfying. A Bollywood actor sang a line on a DVD in a cafe. Half a globe away  a teenager made an Instagram video of it and sent it to me  a stranger. Less than a week later  though  I received a little bit of grace. I received a poignant tweet. It was brief. It just said   Reminds me of an ancient mix tape.  The name was a pseudonym  actually  or a pseudo pseudonym. As soon as I saw the initials  and the profile pic  I knew immediately  my whole body knew immediately who this was  and I knew immediately what mix tape she was talking about. L.D. was my college romance. This is in the early '  s. I was an undegrad. She was a grad student in the library sciences department. Not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off  lets her hair down  suddenly she's smoking hot. She was already smoking hot  she was super dorky  and we had a December May romance  meaning we started dating in December  and by May  she had graduated and became my one that got away. But her mix tape did not get away. I have kept this mix tape in a box with notes and postcards  not just from L.D.  from my life  but for decades. It's the kind of box where  if I have a girlfriend  I tend to hide it from her  and if I had a wife  I'm sure I would share it with her  but the story    Laughter    with this mix tape is there are seven songs per side  but no song titles. Instead  L.D. has used the U.S. Library of Congress classification system  including page numbers  to leave me clues. When I got this mix tape  I put it in my cassette player  I took it to the campus library  her library  I found    books on the shelves. I remember bringing them all to my favorite corner table  and I read poems paired to songs like food to wine  paired  I can tell you  like saddle shoes to a cobalt blue vintage cotton dress. I did this again last October. I'm sitting there  I got new earbuds  old Walkman  I realize this is just the kind of extravagance I used to take for granted even when I was extravagant. And then I thought   Good for him.   PG  is Slavic literature.        series Polish literature. Z A   is a collection of    poems. Page    is Wislawa Szymborska's poem paired with Paul Simon's  Peace Like a River.    I woke up from out of my dream   Rives  Thank you. Appreciate it.  Applause  There's a man by the name of Captain William Swenson who recently was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on September        . On that day  a column of American and Afghan troops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials  a group of Afghan government officials  who would be meeting with some local village elders. The column came under ambush  and was surrounded on three sides  and amongst many other things  Captain Swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead. One of the people he rescued was a sergeant  and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter. And what was remarkable about this day is  by sheer coincidence  one of the medevac medics happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera. It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a gunshot to the neck. They put him in the helicopter  and then you see Captain Swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more. I saw this  and I thought to myself  where do people like that come from  What is that  That is some deep  deep emotion  when you would want to do that. There's a love there  and I wanted to know why is it that I don't have people that I work with like that  You know  in the military  they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain. In business  we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain. We have it backwards. Right  So I asked myself  where do people like this come from  And my initial conclusion was that they're just better people. That's why they're attracted to the military. These better people are attracted to this concept of service. But that's completely wrong. What I learned was that it's the environment  and if you get the environment right  every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things  and more importantly  others have that capacity too. I've had the great honor of getting to meet some of these  who we would call heroes  who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others  and I asked them   Why would you do it  Why did you do it   And they all say the same thing   Because they would have done it for me.  It's this deep sense of trust and cooperation. So trust and cooperation are really important here. The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings  they are not instructions. I can't simply say to you   Trust me   and you will. I can't simply instruct two people  to cooperate  and they will. It's not how it works. It's a feeling. So where does that feeling come from  If you go back        years to the Paleolithic era  to the early days of Homo sapiens  what we find is that the world was filled with danger  all of these forces working very  very hard to kill us. Nothing personal. Whether it was the weather  lack of resources  maybe a saber toothed tiger  all of these things working to reduce our lifespan. And so we evolved into social animals  where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety  inside the tribe  where we felt like we belonged. And when we felt safe amongst our own  the natural reaction was trust and cooperation. There are inherent benefits to this. It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger. If we don't trust each other  if I don't trust you  that means you won't watch for danger. Bad system of survival. The modern day is exactly the same thing. The world is filled with danger  things that are trying to frustrate our lives or reduce our success  reduce our opportunity for success. It could be the ups and downs in the economy  the uncertainty of the stock market. It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight. Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you. It's sometimes trying to put you out of business  but at the very minimum is working hard to frustrate your growth and steal your business from you. We have no control over these forces. These are a constant  and they're not going away. The only variable are the conditions inside the organization  and that's where leadership matters  because it's the leader that sets the tone. When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first  to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice the tangible results  so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong  remarkable things happen. I was flying on a trip  and I was witness to an incident where a passenger attempted to board before their number was called  and I watched the gate agent treat this man like he had broken the law  like a criminal. He was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon. So I said something. I said   Why do you have treat us like cattle  Why can't you treat us like human beings   And this is exactly what she said to me. She said   Sir  if I don't follow the rules  I could get in trouble or lose my job.  All she was telling me is that she doesn't feel safe. All she was telling me is that she doesn't trust her leaders. The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people. It's because they don't fear their leaders. You see  if the conditions are wrong  we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other  and that inherently weakens the organization. When we feel safe inside the organization  we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities. The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is  is like being a parent. If you think about what being a great parent is  what do you want  What makes a great parent  We want to give our child opportunities  education  discipline them when necessary  all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves. Great leaders want exactly the same thing. They want to provide their people opportunity  education  discipline when necessary  build their self confidence  give them the opportunity to try and fail  all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves. Charlie Kim  who's the CEO of a company called Next Jump in New York City  a tech company  he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family  would you ever consider laying off one of your children  We would never do it. Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization  Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment. If you get a job at Next Jump  you cannot get fired for performance issues. In fact  if you have issues  they will coach you and they will give you support  just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school. It's the complete opposite. This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred  anger  at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures. It's not the numbers. It's that they have violated the very definition of leadership. They have violated this deep seated social contract. We know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests  or worse  they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests. This is what so offends us  not the numbers. Would anybody be offended if we gave a      million bonus to Gandhi  How about a      million bonus to Mother Teresa  Do we have an issue with that  None at all. None at all. Great leaders would never sacrifice the people to save the numbers. They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Bob Chapman  who runs a large manufacturing company in the Midwest called Barry Wehmiller  in      was hit very hard by the recession  and they lost    percent of their orders overnight. Now in a large manufacturing company  this is a big deal  and they could no longer afford their labor pool. They needed to save    million dollars  so  like so many companies today  the board got together and discussed layoffs. And Bob refused. You see  Bob doesn't believe in head counts. Bob believes in heart counts  and it's much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count. And so they came up with a furlough program. Every employee  from secretary to CEO  was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation. They could take it any time they wanted  and they did not have to take it consecutively. But it was how Bob announced the program that mattered so much. He said  it's better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot  and morale went up. They saved    million dollars  and most importantly  as would be expected  when the people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization  the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate. And quite spontaneously  nobody expected  people started trading with each other. Those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less. People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three. Leadership is a choice. It is not a rank. I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders. They are authorities  and we do what they say because they have authority over us  but we would not follow them. And I know many people who are at the bottoms of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders  and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them  and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them. This is what a leader is. I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater  and as is the Marine custom  the officer ate last  and he let his men eat first  and when they were done  there was no food left for him. And when they went back out in the field  his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat  because that's what happens. We call them leaders because they go first. We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does. We call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain  and when we do  the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us. They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader's vision comes to life  and when we ask them   Why would you do that  Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person   they all say the same thing   Because they would have done it for me.  And isn't that the organization we would all like to work in  Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  You may be wondering why a marine biologist from Oceana would come here today to talk to you about world hunger. I'm here today because saving the oceans is more than an ecological desire. It's more than a thing we're doing because we want to create jobs for fishermen or preserve fishermen's jobs. It's more than an economic pursuit. Saving the oceans can feed the world. Let me show you how. As you know  there are already more than a billion hungry people on this planet. We're expecting that problem to get worse as world population grows to nine billion or    billion by midcentury  and we can expect to have greater pressure on our food resources. And this is a big concern  especially considering where we are now. Now we know that our arable land per capita is already on the decline in both developed and developing countries. We know that we're headed for climate change  which is going to change rainfall patterns  making some areas drier  as you can see in orange  and others wetter  in blue  causing droughts in our breadbaskets  in places like the Midwest and Central Europe  and floods in others. It's going to make it harder for the land to help us solve the hunger problem. And that's why the oceans need to be their most abundant  so that the oceans can provide us as much food as possible. And that's something the oceans have been doing for us for a long time. As far back as we can go  we've seen an increase in the amount of food we've been able to harvest from our oceans. It just seemed like it was continuing to increase  until about       when we started to see a decline. You've heard of peak oil. Maybe this is peak fish. I hope not. I'm going to come back to that. But you can see about an    percent decline in the amount of fish we've gotten in our world catch since     . And this is a big problem. It's continuing. This red line is continuing to go down. But we know how to turn it around  and that's what I'm going to talk about today. We know how to turn that curve back upwards. This doesn't have to be peak fish. If we do a few simple things in targeted places  we can bring our fisheries back and use them to feed people. First we want to know where the fish are  so let's look where the fish are. It turns out the fish  conveniently  are located for the most part in our coastal areas of the countries  in coastal zones  and these are areas that national jurisdictions have control over  and they can manage their fisheries in these coastal areas. Coastal countries tend to have jurisdictions that go out about     nautical miles  in areas that are called exclusive economic zones  and this is a good thing that they can control their fisheries in these areas  because the high seas  which are the darker areas on this map  the high seas  it's a lot harder to control things  because it has to be done internationally. You get into international agreements  and if any of you are tracking the climate change agreement  you know this can be a very slow  frustrating  tedious process. And so controlling things nationally is a great thing to be able to do. How many fish are actually in these coastal areas compared to the high seas  Well  you can see here about seven times as many fish in the coastal areas than there are in the high seas  so this is a perfect place for us to be focusing  because we can actually get a lot done. We can restore a lot of our fisheries if we focus in these coastal areas. But how many of these countries do we have to work in  There's something like    coastal countries. Do we have to fix fisheries management in all of those countries  So we asked ourselves  how many countries do we need to focus on  keeping in mind that the European Union conveniently manages its fisheries through a common fisheries policy  So if we got good fisheries management in the European Union and  say  nine other countries  how much of our fisheries would we be covering  Turns out  European Union plus nine countries covers about two thirds of the world's fish catch. If we took it up to    countries plus the European Union  we would up to    percent  almost all of the world's fish catch. So we think we can work in a limited number of places to make the fisheries come back. But what do we have to do in these places  Well  based on our work in the United States and elsewhere  we know that there are three key things we have to do to bring fisheries back  and they are  We need to set quotas or limits on how much we take  we need to reduce bycatch  which is the accidental catching and killing of fish that we're not targeting  and it's very wasteful  and three  we need to protect habitats  the nursery areas  the spawning areas that these fish need to grow and reproduce successfully so that they can rebuild their populations. If we do those three things  we  know the fisheries will come back. How do we know  We know because we've seen it happening in a lot of different places. This is a slide that shows the herring population in Norway that was crashing since the     s. It was coming down  and when Norway set limits  or quotas  on its fishery  what happens  The fishery comes back. This is another example  also happens to be from Norway  of the Norwegian Arctic cod. Same deal. The fishery is crashing. They set limits on discards. Discards are these fish they weren't targeting and they get thrown overboard wastefully. When they set the discard limit  the fishery came back. And it's not just in Norway. We've seen this happening in countries all around the world  time and time again. When these countries step in and they put in sustainable fisheries management policies  the fisheries  which are always crashing  it seems  are starting to come back. So there's a lot of promise here. What does this mean for the world fish catch  This means that if we take that fishery catch that's on the decline and we could turn it upwards  we could increase it up to     million metric tons per year. So we didn't have peak fish yet. We still have an opportunity to not only bring the fish back but to actually get more fish that can feed more people than we currently are now. How many more  Right about now  we can feed about     million people a fish meal a day based on the current world fish catch  which  of course  you know is going down  so that number will go down over time if we don't fix it  but if we put fishery management practices like the ones I've described in place in    to    countries  we could bring that number up and feed as many as     million people a year a healthy fish meal. We should obviously do this just because it's a good thing to deal with the hunger problem  but it's also cost effective. It turns out fish is the most cost effective protein on the planet. If you look at how much fish protein you get per dollar invested compared to all of the other animal proteins  obviously  fish is a good business decision. It also doesn't need a lot of land  something that's in short supply  compared to other protein sources. And it doesn't need a lot of fresh water. It uses a lot less fresh water than  for example  cattle  where you have to irrigate a field so that you can grow the food to graze the cattle. It also has a very low carbon footprint. It has a little bit of a carbon footprint because we do have to get out and catch the fish. It takes a little bit of fuel  but as you know  agriculture can have a carbon footprint  and fish has a much smaller one  so it's less polluting. It's already a big part of our diet  but it can be a bigger part of our diet  which is a good thing  because we know that it's healthy for us. It can reduce our risks of cancer  heart disease and obesity. In fact  our CEO Andy Sharpless  who is the originator of this concept  actually  he likes to say fish is the perfect protein. Andy also talks about the fact that our ocean conservation movement really grew out of the land conservation movement  and in land conservation  we have this problem where biodiversity is at war with food production. You have to cut down the biodiverse forest if you want to get the field to grow the corn to feed people with  and so there's a constant push pull there. There's a constant tough decision that has to be made between two very important things  maintaining biodiversity and feeding people. But in the oceans  we don't have that war. In the oceans  biodiversity is not at war with abundance. In fact  they're aligned. When we do things that produce biodiversity  we actually get more abundance  and that's important so that we can feed people. Now  there's a catch. Didn't anyone get that   Laughter  Illegal fishing. Illegal fishing undermines the type of sustainable fisheries management I'm talking about. It can be when you catch fish using gears that have been prohibited  when you fish in places where you're not supposed to fish  you catch fish that are the wrong size or the wrong species. Illegal fishing cheats the consumer and it also cheats honest fishermen  and it needs to stop. The way illegal fish get into our  market is through seafood fraud. You might have heard about this. It's when fish are labeled as something they're not. Think about the last time you had fish. What were you eating  Are you sure that's what it was  Because we tested       different fish samples and about a third of them were not what they were labeled to be. Snappers  nine out of    snappers were not snapper. Fifty nine percent of the tuna we tested was mislabeled. And red snapper  we tested     samples  and only seven of them were really red snapper  so good luck finding a red snapper. Seafood has a really complex supply chain  and at every step in this supply chain  there's an opportunity for seafood fraud  unless we have traceability. Traceability is a way where the seafood industry can track the seafood from the boat to the plate to make sure that the consumer can then find out where their seafood came from. This is a really important thing. It's being done by some in the industry  but not enough  so we're pushing a law in Congress called the SAFE Seafood Act  and I'm very excited today to announce the release of a chef's petition  where     chefs have signed a petition calling on Congress to support the SAFE Seafood Act. It has a lot of celebrity chefs you may know    Anthony Bourdain  Mario Batali  Barton Seaver and others   and they've signed it because they believe that people have a right to know about what they're eating. Fishermen like it too  so there's a good chance we can get the kind of support we need to get this bill through  and it comes at a critical time  because this is the way we stop seafood fraud  this is the way we curb illegal fishing  and this is the way we make sure that quotas  habitat protection  and bycatch reductions can do the jobs they can do. We know that we can manage our fisheries sustainably. We know that we can produce healthy meals for hundreds of millions of people that don't use the land  that don't use much water  have a low carbon footprint  and are cost effective. We know that saving the oceans can feed the world  and we need to start now. Thank you.  Applause  As a student of adversity  I've been struck over the years by how some people with major challenges seem to draw strength from them  and I've heard the popular wisdom that that has to do with finding meaning. And for a long time  I thought the meaning was out there  some great truth waiting to be found. But over time  I've come to feel that the truth is irrelevant. We call it finding meaning  but we might better call it forging meaning. My last book was about how families manage to deal with various kinds of challenging or unusual offspring  and one of the mothers I interviewed  who had two children with multiple severe disabilities  said to me   People always give us these little sayings like  'God doesn't give you any more than you can handle ' but children like ours are not preordained as a gift. They're a gift because that's what we have chosen.  We make those choices all our lives. When I was in second grade  Bobby Finkel had a birthday party and invited everyone in our class but me. My mother assumed there had been some sort of error  and she called Mrs. Finkel  who said that Bobby didn't like me and didn't want me at his party. And that day  my mom took me to the zoo and out for a hot fudge sundae. When I was in seventh grade  one of the kids on my school bus nicknamed me  Percy  as a shorthand for my demeanor  and sometimes  he and his cohort would chant that provocation the entire school bus ride     minutes up     minutes back   Percy  Percy  Percy  Percy   When I was in eighth grade  our science teacher told us that all male homosexuals develop fecal incontinence because of the trauma to their anal sphincter. And I graduated high school without ever going to the cafeteria  where I would have sat with the girls and been laughed at for doing so  or sat with the boys and been laughed at for being a boy who should be sitting with the girls. I survived that childhood through a mix of avoidance and endurance. What I didn't know then  and do know now  is that avoidance and endurance can be the entryway to forging meaning. After you've forged meaning  you need to incorporate that meaning into a new identity. You need to take the traumas and make them part of who you've come to be  and you need to fold the worst events of your life into a narrative of triumph  evincing a better self in response to things that hurt. One of the other mothers I interviewed when I was working on my book had been raped as an adolescent  and had a child following that rape  which had thrown away her career plans and damaged all of her emotional relationships. But when I met her  she was     and I said to her   Do you often think about the man who raped you   And she said   I used to think about him with anger  but now only with pity.  And I thought she meant pity because he was so unevolved as to have done this terrible thing. And I said   Pity   And she said   Yes  because he has a beautiful daughter and two beautiful grandchildren and he doesn't know that  and I do. So as it turns out  I'm the lucky one.  Some of our struggles are things we're born to  our gender  our sexuality  our race  our disability. And some are things that happen to us  being a political prisoner  being a rape victim  being a Katrina survivor. Identity involves entering a community to draw strength from that community  and to give strength there too. It involves substituting  and  for  but     not  I am here but I have cancer   but rather   I have cancer and I am here.  When we're ashamed  we can't tell our stories  and stories are the foundation of identity. Forge meaning  build identity  forge meaning and build identity. That became my mantra. Forging meaning is about changing yourself. Building identity is about changing the world. All of us with stigmatized identities face this question daily  how much to accommodate society by constraining ourselves  and how much to break the limits of what constitutes a valid life  Forging meaning and building identity does not make what was wrong right. It only makes what was wrong precious. In January of this year  I went to Myanmar to interview political prisoners  and I was surprised to find them less bitter than I'd anticipated. Most of them had knowingly committed the offenses that landed them in prison  and they had walked in with their heads held high  and they walked out with their heads still held high  many years later. Dr. Ma Thida  a leading human rights activist who had nearly died in prison and had spent many years in solitary confinement  told me she was grateful to her jailers for the time she had had to think  for the wisdom she had gained  for the chance to hone her meditation skills. She had sought meaning and made her travail into a crucial identity. But if the people I met were less bitter than I'd anticipated about being in prison  they were also less thrilled than I'd expected about the reform process going on in their country. Ma Thida said   We Burmese are noted for our tremendous grace under pressure  but we also have grievance under glamour   she said   and the fact that there have been these shifts and changes doesn't erase the continuing problems in our society that we learned to see so well while we were in prison.  And I understood her to be saying that concessions confer only a little humanity  where full humanity is due  that crumbs are not the same as a place at the table  which is to say you can forge meaning and build identity and still be mad as hell. I've never been raped  and I've never been in anything remotely approaching a Burmese prison  but as a gay American  I've experienced prejudice and even hatred  and I've forged meaning and I've built identity  which is a move I learned from people who had experienced far worse privation than I've ever known. In my own adolescence  I went to extreme lengths to try to be straight. I enrolled myself in something called sexual surrogacy therapy  in which people I was encouraged to call doctors prescribed what I was encouraged to call exercises with women I was encouraged to call surrogates  who were not exactly prostitutes but who were also not exactly anything else. My particular favorite was a blonde woman from the Deep South who eventually admitted to me that she was really a necrophiliac and had taken this job after she got in trouble down at the morgue. These experiences eventually allowed me to have some happy physical relationships with women  for which I'm grateful  but I was at war with myself  and I dug terrible wounds into my own psyche. We don't seek the painful experiences that hew our identities  but we seek our identities in the wake of painful experiences. We cannot bear a pointless torment  but we can endure great pain if we believe that it's purposeful. Ease makes less of an impression on us than struggle. We could have been ourselves without our delights  but not without the misfortunes that drive our search for meaning.  Therefore  I take pleasure in infirmities   St. Paul wrote in Second Corinthians   for when I am weak  then I am strong.  In       I went to Moscow to interview artists of the Soviet underground  and I expected their work to be dissident and political. But the radicalism in their work actually lay in reinserting humanity into a society that was annihilating humanity itself  as  in some senses  Russian society is now doing again. One of the artists I met said to me   We were in training to be not artists but angels.  In       I went back to see the artists I'd been writing about  and I was with them during the putsch that ended the Soviet Union  and they were among the chief organizers of the resistance to that putsch. And on the third day of the putsch  one of them suggested we walk up to Smolenskaya. And we went there  and we arranged ourselves in front of one of the barricades  and a little while later  a column of tanks rolled up  and the soldier on the front tank said   We have unconditional orders to destroy this barricade. If you get out of the way  we don't need to hurt you  but if you won't move  we'll have no choice but to run you down.  And the artists I was with said   Give us just a minute. Give us just a minute to tell you why we're here.  And the soldier folded his arms  and the artist launched into a Jeffersonian panegyric to democracy such as those of us who live in a Jeffersonian democracy would be hard pressed to present. And they went on and on  and the soldier watched  and then he sat there for a full minute after they were finished and looked at us so bedraggled in the rain  and said   What you have said is true  and we must bow to the will of the people. If you'll clear enough space for us to turn around  we'll go back the way we came.  And that's what they did. Sometimes  forging meaning can give you the vocabulary you need to fight for your ultimate freedom. Russia awakened me to the lemonade notion that oppression breeds the power to oppose it  and I gradually understood that as the cornerstone of identity. It took identity to rescue me from sadness. The gay rights movement posits a world in which my aberrances are a victory. Identity politics always works on two fronts  to give pride to people who have a given condition or characteristic  and to cause the outside world to treat such people more gently and more kindly. Those are two totally separate enterprises  but progress in each sphere reverberates in the other. Identity politics can be narcissistic. People extol a difference only because it's theirs. People narrow the world and function in discrete groups without empathy for one another. But properly understood and wisely practiced  identity politics should expand our idea of what it is to be human. Identity itself should be not a smug label or a gold medal but a revolution. I would have had an easier life if I were straight  but I would not be me  and I now like being myself better than the idea of being someone else  someone who  to be honest  I have neither the option of being nor the ability fully to imagine. But if you banish the dragons  you banish the heroes  and we become attached to the heroic strain in our own lives. I've sometimes wondered whether I could have ceased to hate that part of myself without gay pride's technicolor fiesta  of which this speech is one manifestation. I used to think I would know myself to be mature when I could simply be gay without emphasis  but the self loathing of that period left a void  and celebration needs to fill and overflow it  and even if I repay my private debt of melancholy  there's still an outer world of homophobia that it will take decades to address. Someday  being gay will be a simple fact  free of party hats and blame  but not yet. A friend of mine who thought gay pride was getting very carried away with itself  once suggested that we organize Gay Humility Week. It's a great idea  but its time has not yet come. And neutrality  which seems to lie halfway between despair and celebration  is actually the endgame. In    states in the U.S.  I could legally be fired or denied housing for being gay. In Russia  the anti propaganda law has led to people being beaten in the streets. Twenty seven African countries have passed laws against sodomy  and in Nigeria  gay people can legally be stoned to death  and lynchings have become common. In Saudi Arabia recently  two men who had been caught in carnal acts  were sentenced to       lashes each  and are now permanently disabled as a result. So who can forge meaning and build identity  Gay rights are not primarily marriage rights  and for the millions who live in unaccepting places with no resources  dignity remains elusive. I am lucky to have forged meaning and built identity  but that's still a rare privilege  and gay people deserve more collectively than the crumbs of justice. And yet  every step forward is so sweet. In       six years after we met  my partner and I decided to get married. Meeting John had been the discovery of great happiness and also the elimination of great unhappiness  and sometimes  I was so occupied with the disappearance of all that pain that I forgot about the joy  which was at first the less remarkable part of it to me. Marrying was a way to declare our love as more a presence than an absence. Marriage soon led us to children  and that meant new meanings and new identities  ours and theirs. I want my children to be happy  and I love them most achingly when they are sad. As a gay father  I can teach them to own what is wrong in their lives  but I believe that if I succeed in sheltering them from adversity  I will have failed as a parent. A Buddhist scholar I know once explained to me that Westerners mistakenly think that nirvana is what arrives when all your woe is behind you and you have only bliss to look forward to. But he said that would not be nirvana  because your bliss in the present would always be shadowed by the joy from the past. Nirvana  he said  is what you arrive at when you have only bliss to look forward to and find in what looked like sorrows the seedlings of your joy. And I sometimes wonder whether I could have found such fulfillment in marriage and children if they'd come more readily  if I'd been straight in my youth or were young now  in either of which cases this might be easier. Perhaps I could. Perhaps all the complex imagining I've done could have been applied to other topics. But if seeking meaning matters more than finding meaning  the question is not whether I'd be happier for having been bullied  but whether assigning meaning to those experiences has made me a better father. I tend to find the ecstasy hidden in ordinary joys  because I did not expect those joys to be ordinary to me. I know many heterosexuals who have equally happy marriages and families  but gay marriage is so breathtakingly fresh  and gay families so exhilaratingly new  and I found meaning in that surprise. In October  it was my   th birthday  and my family organized a party for me  and in the middle of it  my son said to my husband that he wanted to make a speech  and John said   George  you can't make a speech. You're four.   Only Grandpa and Uncle David and I are going to make speeches tonight.  But George insisted and insisted  and finally  John took him up to the microphone  and George said very loudly   Ladies and gentlemen  may I have your attention please.  And everyone turned around  startled. And George said   I'm glad it's Daddy's birthday. I'm glad we all get cake. And daddy  if you were little  I'd be your friend.  And I thought   Thank you. I thought that I was indebted even to Bobby Finkel  because all those earlier experiences were what had propelled me to this moment  and I was finally unconditionally grateful for a life I'd once have done anything to change. The gay activist Harvey Milk was once asked by a younger gay man what he could do to help the movement  and Harvey Milk said   Go out and tell someone.  There's always somebody who wants to confiscate our humanity  and there are always stories that restore it. If we live out loud  we can trounce the hatred and expand everyone's lives. Forge meaning. Build identity. Forge meaning. Build identity. And then invite the world to share your joy. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  What do augmented reality and professional football have to do with empathy  And what is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow  Now unfortunately  I'm only going to answer one of those questions today  so please  try and contain your disappointment. When most people think about augmented reality  they think about  Minority Report  and Tom Cruise waving his hands in the air  but augmented reality is not science fiction. Augmented reality is something that will happen in our lifetime  and it will happen because we have the tools to make it happen  and people need to be aware of that  because augmented reality will change our lives just as much as the Internet and the cell phone. Now how do we get to augmented reality  Step one is the step I'm wearing right now  Google Glass. I'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass. What you may not be familiar with is that Google Glass is a device that will allow you to see what I see. It will allow you to experience what it is like to be a professional athlete on the field. Right now  the only way you can be on the field is for me to try and describe it to you. I have to use words. I have to create a framework that you then fill in with your imagination. With Google Glass  we can put that underneath a helmet  and we can get a sense of what it's like to be running down the field at     miles an hour  your blood pounding in your ears. You can get a sense of what it's like to have a     pound man sprinting at you trying to decapitate you with every ounce of his being. And I've been on the receiving end of that  and it doesn't feel very good. Now  I have some footage to show you of what it's like to wear Google Glass underneath the helmet to give you a taste of that. Unfortunately  it's not NFL practice footage because the NFL thinks emergent technology is what happens when a submarine surfaces  but    Laughter    we do what we can. So let's pull up some video. Ugh  getting tackled sucks. Hold on  let's get a little closer. All right  ready  Go  Chris Kluwe  So as you can see  small taste of what it's like to get tackled on the football field from the perspective of the tacklee. Now  you may have noticed there are some people missing there  the rest of the team. We have some video of that courtesy of the University of Washington. Blue    Blue    Go  Oh  CK  So again  this takes you a little bit closer to what it's like to be on that field  but this is nowhere what it's like to be on the NFL. Fans want that experience. Fans want to be on that field. They want to be their favorite players  and they've already talked to me on YouTube  they've talked to me on Twitter  saying   Hey  can you get this on a quarterback  Can you get this on a running back  We want that experience.  Well  once we have that experience with GoPro and Google Glass  how do we make it more immersive  How do we take that next step  Well  we take that step by going to something called the Oculus Rift  which I'm sure many of you are also familiar with. The Oculus Rift has been described as one of the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created  and that is not empty hype. I'm going to show you why that is not empty hype with this video. No  No  No  I don't want to play anymore  No  Oh my God  Aaaah  CK  So that is the experience of a man on a roller coaster in fear of his life. What do you think that fan's experience is going to be when we take the video footage of an Adrian Peterson bursting through the line  shedding a tackler with a stiff arm before sprinting in for a touchdown  What do you think that fan's experience is going to be when he's Messi sprinting down the pitch putting the ball in the back of the net  or Federer serving in Wimbledon  What do you think his experience is going to be when he is going down the side of a mountain at over    miles an hour as an Olympic downhill skier  I think adult diaper sales may surge. But this is not yet augmented reality. This is only virtual reality  V.R. How do we get to augmented reality  A.R.  We get to augmented reality when coaches and managers and owners look at this information streaming in that people want to see  and they say   How do we use this to make our teams better  How do we use this to win games   Because teams always use technology to win games. They like winning. It makes them money. So a brief history of technology in the NFL. In       the Baltimore Colts put a wristband on their quarterback to allow him to call plays quicker. They ended up winning a Super Bowl that year. Other teams followed suit. More people watched the game because it was more exciting. It was faster. In       the NFL put helmet radios into the helmets of the quarterbacks  and later the defense. More people watched games because it was faster. It was more entertaining. In       imagine you're a player walking back to the huddle  and you have your next play displayed right in front of your face on your clear plastic visor that you already wear right now. No more having to worry about forgetting plays. No more worrying about having to memorize your playbook. You just go out and react. And coaches really want this  because missed assignments lose you games  and coaches hate losing games. Losing games gets you fired as a coach. They don't want that. But augmented reality is not just an enhanced playbook. Augmented reality is also a way to take all that data and use it in real time to enhance how you play the game. What would that be like  Well  a very simple setup would be a camera on each corner of the stadium looking down  giving you a bird's eye view of all the people down there. You also have information from helmet sensors and accelerometers  technology that's being worked on right now. You take all that information  and you stream it to your players. The good teams stream it in a way that the players can use. The bad ones have information overload. That determines good teams from bad. And now  your I.T. department is just as important as your scouting department  and data mining is not for nerds anymore. It's also for jocks. Who knew  What would that look like on the field  Well  imagine you're the quarterback. You take the snap and you drop back. You're scanning downfield for an open receiver. All of a sudden  a bright flash on the left side of your visor lets you know  blind side linebacker is blitzing in. Normally  you wouldn't be able to see him  but the augmented reality system lets you know. You step up into the pocket. Another flash alerts you to an open receiver. You throw the ball  but you're hit right as you throw. The ball comes off track. You don't know where it's going to land. However  on the receiver's visor  he sees a patch of grass light up  and he knows to readjust. He goes  catches the ball  sprints in  touchdown. Crowd goes wild  and the fans are with him every step of the way  watching from every perspective. Now this is something that will create massive excitement in the game. It will make tons of people watch  because people want this experience. Fans want to be on the field. They want to be their favorite player. Augmented reality will be a part of sports  because it's too profitable not to. But the question I ask you is  is that's all that we're content to use augmented reality for  Are we going to use it solely for our panem  our circenses  our entertainment as normal  Because I believe that we can use augmented reality for something more. I believe we can use augmented reality as a way to foster more empathy within the human species itself  by literally showing someone what it looks like to walk a mile in another person's shoes. We know what this technology is worth to sports leagues. It's worth revenue  to the tune of billions of dollars a year. But what is this technology worth to a teacher in a classroom trying to show a bully just how harmful his actions are from the perspective of the victim  What is this technology worth to a gay Ugandan or Russian trying to show the world what it's like living under persecution  What is this technology worth to a Commander Hadfield or a Neil deGrasse Tyson trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of quarterly reports and Kardashians  Ladies and gentlemen  augmented reality is coming. The questions we ask  the choices we make  and the challenges we face are  as always  up to us. Thank you. I'm excited to be here to speak about vets  because I didn't join the Army because I wanted to go to war. I didn't join the Army because I had a lust or a need to go overseas and fight. Frankly  I joined the Army because college is really damn expensive  and they were going to help with that  and I joined the Army because it was what I knew  and it was what I knew that I thought I could do well. I didn't come from a military family. I'm not a military brat. No one in my family ever had joined the military at all  and how I first got introduced to the military was when I was    years old and I got sent away to military school  because my mother had been threatening me with this idea of military school ever since I was eight years old. I had some issues when I was coming up  and my mother would always tell me  she's like   You know  if you don't get this together  I'm going to send you to military school.  And I'd look at her  and I'd say   Mommy  I'll work harder.  And then when I was nine years old  she started giving me brochures to show me she wasn't playing around  so I'd look at the brochures  and I'm like   Okay  Mommy  I can see you're serious  and I'll work harder.  And then when I was    and     my behavior just kept on getting worse. I was on academic and disciplinary probation before I hit double digits  and I first felt handcuffs on my wrists when I was    years old. And so when I was    years old  my mother came up to me  and she was like   I'm not going to do this anymore. I'm going to send you to military school.  And I looked at her  and I said   Mommy  I can see you're upset  and I'm going to work harder.  And she was like   No  you're going next week.  And that was how I first got introduced to this whole idea of the military  because she thought this was a good idea. I had to disagree with her wholeheartedly when I first showed up there  because literally in the first four days  I had already run away five times from this school. They had these big black gates that surrounded the school  and every time they would turn their backs  I would just simply run out of the black gates and take them up on their offer that if we don't want to be there  we can leave at any time. So I just said   Well  if that's the case  then I'd like to leave.   Laughter  And it never worked. And I kept on getting lost. But then eventually  after staying there for a little while  and after the end of that first year at this military school  I realized that I actually was growing up. I realized the things that I enjoyed about this school and the thing that I enjoyed about the structure was something that I'd never found before  the fact that I finally felt like I was part of something bigger  part of a team  and it actually mattered to people that I was there  the fact that leadership wasn't just a punchline there  but that it was a real  actually core part of the entire experience. And so when it was time for me to actually finish up high school  I started thinking about what I wanted to do  and just like probably most students  had no idea what that meant or what I wanted to do. And I thought about the people who I respected and admired. I thought about a lot of the people  in particular a lot of the men  in my life who I looked up to. They all happened to wear the uniform of the United States of America  so for me  the question and the answer really became pretty easy. The question of what I wanted to do was filled in very quickly with saying  I guess I'll be an Army officer. So the Army then went through this process and they trained me up  and when I say I didn't join the Army because I wanted to go to war  the truth is  I joined in     . There really wasn't a whole lot going on. I didn't ever feel like I was in danger. When I went to my mom  I first joined the Army when I was    years old  so I literally needed parental permission to join the Army  so I kind of gave the paperwork to my mom  and she just assumed it was kind of like military school. She was like   Well  it was good for him before  so I guess I'll just let him keep doing it   having no idea that the paperwork that she was signing was actually signing her son up to become an Army officer. And I went through the process  and again the whole time still just thinking  this is great  maybe I'll serve on a weekend  or two weeks during the year  do drill  and then a couple years after I signed up  a couple years after my mother signed those papers  the whole world changed. And after       there was an entirely new context about the occupation that I chose. When I first joined  I never joined to fight  but now that I was in  this is exactly what was now going to happen. And I thought about so much about the soldiers who I eventually had to end up leading. I remember when we first  right after       three weeks after       I was on a plane heading overseas  but I wasn't heading overseas with the military  I was heading overseas because I got a scholarship to go overseas. I received the scholarship to go overseas and to go study and live overseas  and I was living in England and that was interesting  but at the same time  the same people who I was training with  the same soldiers that I went through all my training with  and we prepared for war  they were now actually heading over to it. They were now about to find themselves in the middle of places the fact is the vast majority of people  the vast majority of us as we were training  couldn't even point out on a map. I spent a couple years finishing graduate school  and the whole entire time while I'm sitting there in buildings at Oxford that were literally built hundreds of years before the United States was even founded  and I'm sitting there talking to dons about the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand  and how that influenced the start of World War I  where the entire time my heart and my head were on my soldiers who were now throwing on Kevlars and grabbing their flak vests and figuring out how exactly do I change around or how exactly do I clean a machine gun in the darkness. That was the new reality. By the time I finished that up and I rejoined my military unit and we were getting ready to deploy to Afghanistan  there were soldiers in my unit who were now on their second and third deployments before I even had my first. I remember walking out with my unit for the first time  and when you join the Army and you go through a combat tour  everyone looks at your shoulder  because on your shoulder is your combat patch. And so immediately as you meet people  you shake their hand  and then your eyes go to their shoulder  because you want to see where did they serve  or what unit did they serve with  And I was the only person walking around with a bare shoulder  and it burned every time someone stared at it. But you get a chance to talk to your soldiers  and you ask them why did they sign up. I signed up because college was expensive. A lot of my soldiers signed up for completely different reasons. They signed up because of a sense of obligation. They signed up because they were angry and they wanted to do something about it. They signed up because their family said this was important. They signed up because they wanted some form of revenge. They signed for a whole collection of different reasons. And now we all found ourselves overseas fighting in these conflicts. And what was amazing to me was that I very naively started hearing this statement that I never fully understood  because right after       you start hearing this idea where people come up to you and they say   Well  thank you for your service.  And I just kind of followed in and started saying the same things to all my soldiers. This is even before I deployed. But I really had no idea what that even meant. I just said it because it sounded right. I said it because it sounded like the right thing to say to people who had served overseas.  Thank you for your service.  But I had no idea what the context was or what that even  what it even meant to the people who heard it. When I first came back from Afghanistan  I thought that if you make it back from conflict  then the dangers were all over. I thought that if you made it back from a conflict zone that somehow you could kind of wipe the sweat off your brow and say   Whew  I'm glad I dodged that one   without understanding that for so many people  as they come back home  the war keeps going. It keeps playing out in all of our minds. It plays out in all of our memories. It plays out in all of our emotions. Please forgive us if we don't like being in big crowds. Please forgive us when we spend one week in a place that has     percent light discipline  because you're not allowed to walk around with white lights  because if anything has a white light  it can be seen from miles away  versus if you use little green or little blue lights  they cannot be seen from far away. So please forgive us if out of nowhere  we go from having     percent light discipline to then a week later being back in the middle of Times Square  and we have a difficult time adjusting to that. Please forgive us when you transition back to a family who has completely been maneuvering without you  and now when you come back  it's not that easy to fall back into a sense of normality  because the whole normal has changed. I remember when I came back  I wanted to talk to people. I wanted people to ask me about my experiences. I wanted people to come up to me and tell me   What did you do   I wanted people to come up to me and tell me   What was it like  What was the food like  What was the experience like  How are you doing   And the only questions I got from people was   Did you shoot anybody   And those were the ones who were even curious enough to say anything. Because sometimes there's this fear and there's this apprehension that if I say anything  I'm afraid I'll offend  or I'm afraid I'll trigger something  so the common default is just saying nothing. The problem with that is then it feels like your service was not even acknowledged  like no one even cared.  Thank you for your service   and we move on. What I wanted to better understand was what's behind that  and why  thank you for your service  isn't enough. The fact is  we have literally  .  million men and women who are veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan who are all amongst us. Sometimes we know who they are  sometimes we don't  but there is that feeling  the shared experience  the shared bond where we know that that experience and that chapter of our life  while it might be closed  it's still not over. We think about  thank you for your service   and people say   So what does 'thank you for your service' mean to you   Well   Thank you for your service  means to me  it means acknowledging our stories  asking us who we are  understanding the strength that so many people  so many people who we serve with  have  and why that service means so much.  Thank you for your service  means acknowledging the fact that just because we've now come home and we've taken off the uniform does not mean our larger service to this country is somehow over. The fact is  there's still a tremendous amount that can be offered and can be given. When I look at people like our friend Taylor Urruela  who in Iraq loses his leg  had two big dreams in his life. One was to be a soldier. The other was to be a baseball player. He loses his leg in Iraq. He comes back and instead of deciding that  well  now since I've lost my leg  that second dream is over  he decides that he still has that dream of playing baseball  and he starts this group called VETSports  which now works with veterans all over the country and uses sports as a way of healing. People like Tammy Duckworth  who was a helicopter pilot and with the helicopter that she was flying  you need to use both your hands and also your legs to steer  and her helicopter gets hit  and she's trying to steer the chopper  but the chopper's not reacting to her instructions and to her commands. She's trying to land the chopper safely  but the chopper doesn't land safely  and the reason it's not landing safely is because it's not responding to the commands that her legs are giving because her legs were blown off. She barely survives. Medics come and they save her life  but then as she's doing her recuperation back at home  she realizes that   My job's still not done.  And now she uses her voice as a Congresswoman from Illinois to fight and advocate for a collection of issues to include veterans issues. We signed up because we love this country we represent. We signed up because we believe in the idea and we believe in the people to our left and to our right. And the only thing we then ask is that  thank you for your service  needs to be more than just a quote break  that  thank you for your service  means honestly digging in to the people who have stepped up simply because they were asked to  and what that means for us not just now  not just during combat operations  but long after the last vehicle has left and after the last shot has been taken. These are the people who I served with  and these are the people who I honor. So thank you for your service. I'm going to ask and try to answer  in some ways  kind of an uncomfortable question. Both civilians  obviously  and soldiers suffer in war  I don't think any civilian has ever missed the war that they were subjected to. I've been covering wars for almost    years  and one of the remarkable things for me is how many soldiers find themselves missing it. How is it someone can go through the worst experience imaginable  and come home  back to their home  and their family  their country  and miss the war  How does that work  What does it mean  We have to answer that question  because if we don't  it'll be impossible to bring soldiers back to a place in society where they belong  and I think it'll also be impossible to stop war  if we don't understand how that mechanism works. The problem is that war does not have a simple  neat truth  one simple  neat truth. Any sane person hates war  hates the idea of war  wouldn't want to have anything to do with it  doesn't want to be near it  doesn't want to know about it. That's a sane response to war. But if I asked all of you in this room  who here has paid money to go to a cinema and be entertained by a Hollywood war movie  most of you would probably raise your hands. That's what's so complicated about war. And trust me  if a room full of peace loving people finds something compelling about war  so do    year old soldiers who have been trained in it  I promise you. That's the thing that has to be understood. I've covered war for about    years  as I said  but my most intense experiences in combat were with American soldiers in Afghanistan. I've been in Africa  the Middle East  Afghanistan in the '  s  but it was with American soldiers in             that I was confronted with very intense combat. I was in a small valley called the Korengal Valley in eastern Afghanistan. It was six miles long. There were     men of Battle Company in that valley  and for a while  while I was there  almost    percent of all the combat in all of Afghanistan was happening in those six miles. A hundred and fifty men were absorbing almost a fifth of the combat for all of NATO forces in the country  for a couple months. It was very intense. I spent most of my time at a small outpost called Restrepo. It was named after the platoon medic that had been killed about two months into the deployment. It was a few plywood B huts clinging to a side of a ridge  and sandbags  bunkers  gun positions  and there were    men up there of Second Platoon  Battle Company. I spent most of my time up there. There was no running water. There was no way to bathe. The guys were up there for a month at a time. They never even got out of their clothes. They fought. The worked. They slept in the same clothes. They never took them off  and at the end of the month  they went back down to the company headquarters  and by then  their clothes were unwearable. They burned them and got a new set. There was no Internet. There was no phone. There was no communication with the outside world up there. There was no cooked food. There was nothing up there that young men typically like  no cars  no girls  no television  nothing except combat. Combat they did learn to like. I remember one day  it was a very hot day in the spring  and we hadn't been in a fight in a couple of weeks  maybe. Usually  the outpost was attacked  and we hadn't seen any combat in a couple of weeks  and everyone was just stunned with boredom and heat. And I remember the lieutenant walking past me sort of stripped to the waist. It was incredibly hot. Stripped to the waist  walked past me muttering   Oh God  please someone attack us today.  That's how bored they were. That's war too  is a lieutenant saying   Please make something happen because we're going crazy.  To understand that  you have to  for a moment  think about combat not morally    that's an important job to do   but for a moment  don't think about it morally  think about it neurologically. Let's think about what happens in your brain when you're in combat. First of all  the experience is very bizarre  it's a very bizarre one. It's not what I had expected. Usually  you're not scared. I've been very scared in combat  but most of the time when I was out there  I wasn't scared. I was very scared beforehand and incredibly scared afterwards  and that fear that comes afterwards can last years. I haven't been shot at in six years  and I was woken up very abruptly this morning by a nightmare that I was being strafed by aircraft  six years later. I've never even been strafed by aircraft  and I was having nightmares about it. Time slows down. You get this weird tunnel vision. You notice some details very  very  very accurately and other things drop out. It's almost a slightly altered state of mind. What's happening in your brain is you're getting an enormous amount of adrenaline pumped through your system. Young men will go to great lengths to have that experience. It's wired into us. It's hormonally supported. The mortality rate for young men in society is six times what it is for young women from violence and from accidents  just the stupid stuff that young men do  jumping off of things they shouldn't jump off of  lighting things on fire they shouldn't light on fire  I mean  you know what I'm talking about. They die at six times the rate that young women do. Statistically  you are safer as a teenage boy  you would be safer in the fire department or the police department in most American cities than just walking around the streets of your hometown looking for something to do  statistically. You can imagine how that plays out in combat. At Restrepo  every guy up there was almost killed  including me  including my good friend Tim Hetherington  who was later killed in Libya. There were guys walking around with bullet holes in their uniforms  rounds that had cut through the fabric and didn't touch their bodies. I was leaning against some sandbags one morning  not much going on  sort of spacing out  and some sand was kicked into the side of  sort of hit the side of my face. Something hit the side of my face  and I didn't know what it was. You have to understand about bullets that they go a lot faster than sound  so if someone shoots at you from a few hundred meters  the bullet goes by you  or hits you obviously  half a second or so before the sound catches up to it. So I had some sand sprayed in the side of my face. Half a second later  I heard dut dut dut dut duh. It was machine gun fire. It was the first round  the first burst of an hour long firefight. What had happened was the bullet hit  a bullet hit three or four inches from the side of my head. Imagine  just think about it  because I certainly did  think about the angle of deviation that saved my life. At     meters  it missed me by three inches. Just think about the math on that. Every guy up there had some experience like that  at least once  if not many times. The boys are up there for a year. They got back. Some of them got out of the Army and had tremendous psychological problems when they got home. Some of them stayed in the Army and were more or less okay  psychologically. I was particularly close to a guy named Brendan O'Byrne. I'm still very good friends with him. He came back to the States. He got out of the Army. I had a dinner party one night. I invited him  and he started talking with a woman  one of my friends  and she knew how bad it had been out there  and she said   Brendan  is there anything at all that you miss about being out in Afghanistan  about the war   And he thought about it quite a long time  and finally he said   Ma'am  I miss almost all of it.  And he's one of the most traumatized people I've seen from that war.  Ma'am  I miss almost all of it.  What is he talking about  He's not a psychopath. He doesn't miss killing people. He's not crazy. He doesn't miss getting shot at and seeing his friends get killed. What is it that he misses  We have to answer that. If we're going to stop war  we have to answer that question. I think what he missed is brotherhood. He missed  in some ways  the opposite of killing. What he missed was connection to the other men he was with. Now  brotherhood is different from friendship. Friendship happens in society  obviously. The more you like someone  the more you'd be willing to do for them. Brotherhood has nothing to do with how you feel about the other person. It's a mutual agreement in a group that you will put the welfare of the group  you will put the safety of everyone in the group above your own. In effect  you're saying   I love these other people more than I love myself.  Brendan was a team leader in command of three men  and the worst day in Afghanistan   He was almost killed so many times. It didn't bother him. The worst thing that happened to him in Afghanistan was one of his men was hit in the head with a bullet in the helmet  knocked him over. They thought he was dead. It was in the middle of a huge firefight. No one could deal with it  and a minute later  Kyle Steiner sat back up from the dead  as it were  because he'd come back to consciousness. The bullet had just knocked him out. It glanced off the helmet. He remembers people saying  as he was sort of half conscious  he remembers people saying   Steiner's been hit in the head. Steiner's dead.  And he was thinking   I'm not dead.  And he sat up. And Brendan realized after that that he could not protect his men  and that was the only time he cried in Afghanistan  was realizing that. That's brotherhood. This wasn't invented recently. Many of you have probably read  The Iliad.  Achilles surely would have risked his life or given his life to save his friend Patroclus. In World War II  there were many stories of soldiers who were wounded  were brought to a rear base hospital  who went AWOL  crawled out of windows  slipped out doors  went AWOL  wounded  to make their way back to the front lines to rejoin their brothers out there. So you think about Brendan  you think about all these soldiers having an experience like that  a bond like that  in a small group  where they loved    other people in some ways more than they loved themselves  you think about how good that would feel  imagine it  and they are blessed with that experience for a year  and then they come home  and they are just back in society like the rest of us are  not knowing who they can count on  not knowing who loves them  who they can love  not knowing exactly what anyone they know would do for them if it came down to it. That is terrifying. Compared to that  war  psychologically  in some ways  is easy  compared to that kind of alienation. That's why they miss it  and that's what we have to understand and in some ways fix in our society. Thank you very much. So it was the fall of       and President Theodore Roosevelt needed a little break from the White House  so he took a train to Mississippi to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town called Smedes. The first day of the hunt  they didn't see a single bear  so it was a big bummer for everyone  but the second day  the dogs cornered one after a really long chase  but by that point  the president had given up and gone back to camp for lunch  so his hunting guide cracked the animal on the top of the head with the butt of his rifle  and then tied it up to a tree and started tooting away on his bugle to call Roosevelt back so he could have the honor of shooting it. The bear was a female. It was dazed  injured  severely underweight  a little mangy looking  and when Roosevelt saw this animal tied up to the tree  he just couldn't bring himself to fire at it. He felt like that would go against his code as a sportsman. A few days later  the scene was memorialized in a political cartoon back in Washington. It was called  Drawing a Line in Mississippi   and it showed Roosevelt with his gun down and his arm out  sparing the bear's life  and the bear was sitting on its hind legs with these two big  frightened  wide eyes and little ears pricked up at the top of its head. It looked really helpless  like you just wanted to sweep it up into your arms and reassure it. It wouldn't have looked familiar at the time  but if you go looking for the cartoon now  you recognize the animal right away  It's a teddy bear. And this is how the teddy bear was born. Essentially  toymakers took the bear from the cartoon  turned it into a plush toy  and then named it after President Roosevelt    Teddy's bear. And I do feel a little ridiculous that I'm up here on this stage and I'm choosing to use my time to tell you about a     year old story about the invention of a squishy kid's toy  but I'd argue that the invention of the teddy bear  inside that story is a more important story  a story about how dramatically our ideas about nature can change  and also about how  on the planet right now  the stories that we tell are dramatically changing nature. Because think about the teddy bear. For us  in retrospect  it feels like an obvious fit  because bears are so cute and cuddly  and who wouldn't want to give one to their kids to play with  but the truth is that in       bears weren't cute and cuddly. I mean  they looked the same  but no one thought of them that way. In       bears were monsters. Bears were something that frickin' terrified kids. For generations at that point  the bear had been a shorthand for all the danger that people were encountering on the frontier  and the federal government was actually systematically exterminating bears and lots of other predators too  like coyotes and wolves. These animals  they were being demonized. They were called murderers because they killed people's livestock. One government biologist  he explained this war on animals like the bear by saying that they no longer had a place in our advancing civilization  and so we were just clearing them out of the way. In one    year period  close to half a million wolves had been slaughtered. The grizzly would soon be wiped out from    percent of its original territory  and whereas once there had been    million bison moving across the plains  and you would have these stories of trains having to stop for four or five hours so that these thick  living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks  now  by       there were maybe  less than     left in the wild. And so what I'm saying is  the teddy bear was born into the middle of this great spasm of extermination  and you can see it as a sign that maybe some people deep down were starting to feel conflicted about all that killing. America still hated the bear and feared it  but all of a sudden  America also wanted to give the bear a great big hug. So this is something that I've been really curious about in the last few years. How do we imagine animals  how do we think and feel about them  and how do their reputations get written and then rewritten in our minds  We're here living in the eye of a great storm of extinction where half the species on the planet could be gone by the end of the century  and so why is it that we come to care about some of those species and not others  Well  there's a new field  a relatively new field of social science that started looking at these questions and trying to unpack the powerful and sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationships that we have to animals  and I spent a lot of time looking through their academic journals  and all I can really say is that their findings are astonishingly wide ranging. So some of my favorites include that the more television a person watches in Upstate New York  the more he or she is afraid of being attacked by a black bear. If you show a tiger to an American  they're much more likely to assume that it's female and not male. In a study where a fake snake and a fake turtle were put on the side of the road  drivers hit the snake much more often than the turtle  and about three percent of drivers who hit the fake animals seemed to do it on purpose. Women are more likely than men to get a  magical feeling  when they see dolphins in the surf. Sixty eight percent of mothers with  high feelings of entitlement and self esteem  identified with the dancing cats in a commercial for Purina.  Laughter  Americans consider lobsters more important than pigeons but also much  much stupider. Wild turkeys are seen as only slightly more dangerous than sea otters  and pandas are twice as lovable as ladybugs. So some of this is physical  right  We tend to sympathize more with animals that look like us  and especially that resemble human babies  so with big  forward facing eyes and circular faces  kind of a roly poly posture. This is why  if you get a Christmas card from  like  your great aunt in Minnesota  there's usually a fuzzy penguin chick on it  and not something like a Glacier Bay wolf spider. But it's not all physical  right  There's a cultural dimension to how we think about animals  and we're telling stories about these animals  and like all stories  they are shaped by the times and the places in which we're telling them. So think about that moment back in      again where a ferocious bear became a teddy bear. What was the context  Well  America was urbanizing. For the first time  nearly a majority of people lived in cities  so there was a growing distance between us and nature. There was a safe space where we could reconsider the bear and romanticize it. Nature could only start to seem this pure and adorable because we didn't have to be afraid of it anymore. And you can see that cycle playing out again and again with all kinds of animals. It seems like we're always stuck between demonizing a species and wanting to wipe it out  and then when we get very close to doing that  empathizing with it as an underdog and wanting to show it compassion. So we exert our power  but then we're unsettled by how powerful we are. So for example  this is one of probably thousands of letters and drawings that kids sent to the Bush administration  begging it to protect the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act  and these were sent back in the mid     s  when awareness of climate change was suddenly surging. We kept seeing that image of a polar bear stranded on a little ice floe looking really morose. I spent days looking through these files. I really love them. This one's my favorite. If you can see  it's a polar bear that's drowning and then it's also being eaten simultaneously by a lobster and a shark. This one came from a kid named Fritz  and he's actually got a solution to climate change. He's got it all worked out to an ethanol based solution. He says   I feel bad about the polar bears. I like polar bears. Everyone can use corn juice for cars. From Fritz.  So     years ago  you would have Arctic explorers writing about polar bears leaping into their boats and trying to devour them  even if they lit the bear on fire  but these kids don't see the polar bear that way  and actually they don't even see the polar bear the way that I did back in the '  s. I mean  we thought of these animals as mysterious and terrifying lords of the Arctic. But look now how quickly that climate change has flipped the image of the animal in our minds. It's gone from that bloodthirsty man killer to this delicate  drowning victim  and when you think about it  that's kind of the conclusion to the story that the teddy bear started telling back in       because back then  America had more or less conquered its share of the continent. We were just getting around to polishing off these last wild predators. Now  society's reach has expanded all the way to the top of the world  and it's made even these  the most remote  the most powerful bears on the planet  seem like adorable and blameless victims. But you know  there's also a postscript to the teddy bear story that not a lot of people talk about. We're going to talk about it  because even though it didn't really take long after Roosevelt's hunt in      for the toy to become a full blown craze  most people figured it was a fad  it was a sort of silly political novelty item and it would go away once the president left office  and so by       when Roosevelt's successor  William Howard Taft  was getting ready to be inaugurated  the toy industry was on the hunt for the next big thing. They didn't do too well. That January  Taft was the guest of honor at a banquet in Atlanta  and for days in advance  the big news was the menu. They were going to be serving him a Southern specialty  a delicacy  really  called possum and taters. So you would have a whole opossum roasted on a bed of sweet potatoes  and then sometimes they'd leave the big tail on it like a big  meaty noodle. The one brought to Taft's table weighed    pounds. So after dinner  the orchestra started to play  and the guests burst into song  and all of a sudden  Taft was surprised with the presentation of a gift from a group of local supporters  and this was a stuffed opossum toy  all beady eyed and bald eared  and it was a new product they were putting forward to be the William Taft presidency's answer to Teddy Roosevelt's teddy bear. They were calling it the  billy possum.  Within    hours  the Georgia Billy Possum Company was up and running  brokering deals for these things nationwide  and the Los Angeles Times announced  very confidently   The teddy bear has been relegated to a seat in the rear  and for four years  possibly eight  the children of the United States will play with billy possum.  So from that point  there was a fit of opossum fever. There were billy possum postcards  billy possum pins  billy possum pitchers for your cream at coffee time. There were smaller billy possums on a stick that kids could wave around like flags. But even with all this marketing  the life of the billy possum turned out to be just pathetically brief. The toy was an absolute flop  and it was almost completely forgotten by the end of the year  and what that means is that the billy possum didn't even make it to Christmastime  which when you think about it is a special sort of tragedy for a toy. So we can explain that failure two ways. The first  well  it's pretty obvious. I'm going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway  Opossums are hideous.  Laughter  But maybe more importantly is that the story of the billy possum was all wrong  especially compared to the backstory of the teddy bear. Think about it  for most of human's evolutionary history  what's made bears impressive to us has been their complete independence from us. It's that they live these parallel lives as menaces and competitors. By the time Roosevelt went hunting in Mississippi  that stature was being crushed  and the animal that he had roped to a tree really was a symbol for all bears. Whether those animals lived or died now was entirely up to the compassion or the indifference of people. That said something really ominous about the future of bears  but it also said something very  unsettling about who we'd become  if the survival of even an animal like that was up to us now. So now  a century later  if you're at all paying attention to what's happening in the environment  you feel that discomfort so much more intensely. We're living now in an age of what scientists have started to call  conservation reliance   and what that term means is that we've disrupted so much that nature can't possibly stand on its own anymore  and most endangered species are only going to survive if we stay out there in the landscape riggging the world around them in their favor. So we've gone hands on and we can't ever take our hands off  and that's a hell of a lot of work. Right now  we're training condors not to perch on power lines. We teach whooping cranes to migrate south for the winter behind little ultra light airplanes. We're out there feeding plague vaccine to ferrets. We monitor pygmy rabbits with drones. So we've gone from annihilating species to micromanaging the survival of a lot of species indefinitely  and which ones  Well  the ones that we've told compelling stories about  the ones we've decided ought to stick around. The line between conservation and domestication is blurred. So what I've been saying is that the stories that we tell about wild animals are so subjective they can be irrational or romanticized or sensationalized. Sometimes they just have nothing to do with the facts. But in a world of conservation reliance  those stories have very real consequences  because now  how we feel about an animal affects its survival more than anything that you read about in ecology textbooks. Storytelling matters now. Emotion matters. Our imagination has become an ecological force. And so maybe the teddy bear worked in part because the legend of Roosevelt and that bear in Mississippi was kind of like an allegory of this great responsibility that society was just beginning to face up to back then. It would be another    years before the Endangered Species Act was passed  but really  here's its whole ethos boiled down into something like a scene you'd see in a stained glass window. The bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree  and the president of the United States decided to show it some mercy. Thank you.  Illustrations by Wendy MacNaughton  As a little girl  I always imagined I would one day run away. From the age of six on  I kept a packed bag with some clothes and cans of food tucked away in the back of a closet. There was a deep restlessness in me  a primal fear that I would fall prey to a life of routine and boredom. And so  many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where I would walk across borders  forage for berries  and meet all kinds of strange people living unconventional lives on the road. Years have passed  but many of the adventures I fantasized about as a child    traveling and weaving my way between worlds other than my own   have become realities through my work as a documentary photographer. But no other experience has felt as true to my childhood dreams as living amongst and documenting the lives of fellow wanderers across the United States. This is the nomadic dream  a different kind of American dream lived by young hobos  travelers  hitchhikers  vagrants and tramps. In most of our minds  the vagabond is a creature from the past. The word  hobo  conjures up an old black and white image of a weathered old man covered in coal  legs dangling out of a boxcar  but these photographs are in color  and they portray a community swirling across the country  fiercely alive and creatively free  seeing sides of America that no one else gets to see. Like their predecessors  today's nomads travel the steel and asphalt arteries of the United States. By day  they hop freight trains  stick out their thumbs  and ride the highways with anyone from truckers to soccer moms. By night  they sleep beneath the stars  huddled together with their packs of dogs  cats and pet rats between their bodies. Some travelers take to the road by choice  renouncing materialism  traditional jobs and university degrees in exchange  for a glimmer of adventure. Others come from the underbelly of society  never given a chance to mobilize upwards  foster care dropouts  teenage runaways escaping abuse and unforgiving homes. Where others see stories of privation and economic failure  travelers view their own existence through the prism of liberation and freedom. They'd rather live off of the excess of what they view as a wasteful consumer society than slave away at an unrealistic chance at the traditional American dream. They take advantage of the fact that in the United States  up to    percent of all food ends up in the garbage by scavenging for perfectly good produce in dumpsters and trash cans. They sacrifice material comforts in exchange for the space and the time to explore a creative interior  to dream  to read  to work on music  art and writing. But there are many aspects to this life that are far from idyllic. No one loses their inner demons by taking to the road. Addiction is real  the elements are real  freight trains maim and kill  and anyone who has lived on the streets can attest to the exhaustive list of laws that criminalize homeless existence. Who here knows that in many cities across the United States it is now illegal to sit on the sidewalk  to wrap oneself in a blanket  to sleep in your own car  to offer food to a stranger  I know about these laws because I've watched as friends and other travelers were hauled off to jail or received citations for committing these so called crimes. Many of you might be wondering why anyone would choose a life like this  under the thumb of discriminatory laws  eating out of trash cans  sleeping under bridges  picking up seasonal jobs here and there. The answer to such a question is as varied as the people that take to the road  but travelers often respond with a single word  freedom. Until we live in a society where every human is assured dignity in their labor so that they can work to live well  not only work to survive  there will always be an element of those who seek the open road as a means of escape  of liberation and  of course  of rebellion. Thank you. Approximately    years ago  when I was in oncology at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia  a father and a son walked into my office and they both had their right eye missing  and as I took the history  it became apparent that the father and the son had a rare form of inherited eye tumor  retinoblastoma  and the father knew that he had passed that fate on to his son. That moment changed my life. It propelled me to go on and to co lead a team that discovered the first cancer susceptibility gene  and in the intervening decades since then  there has been literally a seismic shift in our understanding of what goes on  what genetic variations are sitting behind various diseases. In fact  for thousands of human traits  a molecular basis that's known for that  and for thousands of people  every day  there's information that they gain about the risk of going on to get this disease or that disease. At the same time  if you ask   Has that impacted the efficiency  how we've been able to develop drugs   the answer is not really. If you look at the cost of developing drugs  how that's done  it basically hasn't budged that. And so it's as if we have the power to diagnose yet not the power to fully treat. And there are two commonly given reasons for why that happens. One of them is it's early days. We're just learning the words  the fragments  the letters in the genetic code. We don't know how to read the sentences. We don't know how to follow the narrative. The other reason given is that most of those changes are a loss of function  and it's actually really hard to develop drugs that restore function. But today  I want us to step back and ask a more fundamental question  and ask   What happens if we're thinking about this maybe in the wrong context   We do a lot of studying of those who are sick and building up long lists of altered components. But maybe  if what we're trying to do is to develop therapies for prevention  maybe what we should be doing is studying those who don't get sick. Maybe we should be studying those that are well. A vast majority of those people are not necessarily carrying a particular genetic load or risk factor. They're not going to help us. There are going to be those individuals who are carrying a potential future risk  they're going to go on to get some symptom. That's not what we're looking for. What we're asking and looking for is  are there a very few set of individuals who are actually walking around with the risk that normally would cause a disease  but something in them  something hidden in them is actually protective and keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms  If you're going to do a study like that  you can imagine you'd like to look at lots and lots of people. We'd have to go and have a pretty wide study  and we realized that actually one way to think of this is  let us look at adults who are over    years of age  and let's make sure that we look at those who were healthy as kids. They might have had individuals in their families who had had a childhood disease  but not necessarily. And let's go and then screen those to find those who are carrying genes for childhood diseases. Now  some of you  I can see you putting your hands up going   Uh  a little odd. What's your evidence that this could be feasible   I want to give you two examples. The first comes from San Francisco. It comes from the     s and the     s  and you may know the story where there were individuals who had very high levels of the virus HIV. They went on to get AIDS. But there was a very small set of individuals who also had very high levels of HIV. They didn't get AIDS. And astute clinicians tracked that down  and what they found was they were carrying mutations. Notice  they were carrying mutations from birth that were protective  that were protecting them from going on to get AIDS. You may also know that actually a line of therapy has been coming along based on that fact. Second example  more recent  is elegant work done by Helen Hobbs  who said   I'm going to look at individuals who have very high lipid levels  and I'm going to try to find those people with high lipid levels who don't go on to get heart disease.  And again  what she found was some of those individuals had mutations that were protective from birth that kept them  even though they had high lipid levels  and you can see this is an interesting way of thinking about how you could develop preventive therapies. The project that we're working on is called  The Resilience Project  A Search for Unexpected Heroes   because what we are interested in doing is saying  can we find those rare individuals who might have these hidden protective factors  And in some ways  think of it as a decoder ring  a sort of resilience decoder ring that we're going to try to build. We've realized that we should  do this in a systematic way  so we've said  let's take every single childhood inherited disease. Let's take them all  and let's pull them back a little bit by those that are known to have severe symptoms  where the parents  the child  those around them would know that they'd gotten sick  and let's go ahead and then frame them again by those parts of the genes where we know that there is a particular alteration that is known to be highly penetrant to cause that disease. Where are we going to look  Well  we could look locally. That makes sense. But we began to think  maybe we should look all over the world. Maybe we should look not just here but in remote places where their might be a distinct genetic context  there might be environmental factors that protect people. And let's look at a million individuals. Now the reason why we think it's a good time to do that now is  in the last couple of years  there's been a remarkable plummeting in the cost to do this type of analysis  this type of data generation  to where it actually costs less to do the data generation and analysis than it does to do the sample processing and the collection. The other reason is that in the last five years  there have been awesome tools  things about network biology  systems biology  that have come up that allow us to think that maybe we could decipher those positive outliers. And as we went around talking to researchers and institutions and telling them about our story  something happened. They started saying   This is interesting. I would be glad to join your effort. I would be willing to participate.  And they didn't say   Where's the MTA   They didn't say   Where is my authorship   They didn't say   Is this data going  to be mine  Am I going to own it   They basically said   Let's work on this in an open  crowd sourced  team way to do this decoding.  Six months ago  we locked down the screening key for this decoder. My co lead  a brilliant scientist  Eric Schadt at the Icahn Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York  and his team  locked in that decoder key ring  and we began looking for samples  because what we realized is  maybe we could just go and look at some existing samples to get some sense of feasibility. Maybe we could take two  three  percent of the project on  and see if it was there. And so we started asking people such as Hakon at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia. We asked Leif up in Finland. We talked to Anne Wojcicki at   andMe  and Wang Jun at BGI  and again  something remarkable happened. They said   Huh  not only do we have samples  but often we've analyzed them  and we would be glad to go into our anonymized samples and see if we could find those that you're looking for.  And instead of being        or         last month we passed one half million samples that we've already analyzed. So you must be going   Huh  did you find any unexpected heroes   And the answer is  we didn't find one or two. We found dozens of these strong candidate unexpected heroes. So we think that the time is now to launch the beta phase of this project and actually start getting prospective individuals. Basically all we need is information. We need a swab of DNA and a willingness to say   What's inside me  I'm willing to be re contacted.  Most of us spend our lives  when it comes to health and disease  acting as if we're voyeurs. We delegate the responsibility for the understanding of our disease  for the treatment of our disease  to anointed experts. In order for us to get this project to work  we need individuals to step up in a different role and to be engaged  to realize this dream  this open crowd sourced project  to find those unexpected heroes  to evolve from the current concepts of resources and constraints  to design those preventive therapies  and to extend it beyond childhood diseases  to go all the way up to ways that we could look at Alzheimer's or Parkinson's  we're going to need us to be looking inside ourselves and asking   What are our roles  What are our genes   and looking within ourselves for information we used to say we should go to the outside  to experts  and to be willing to share that with others. Thank you very much.   It's all there in gospels    A Magdalene girl comes to pay her respects     But her mind is awhirl     When she finds the tomb empty     Straw had been rolled     Not a sign of a corpse     In the dark and the cold     When she reaches the door     Sees an unholy sight     There's a solitary figure and a halo of light     He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill     In an Almighty hurry     Aye  but she might catch him still     Tell me where are you gone  Lord     And why in such haste      Oh don't hinder me  woman     I've no time to waste     For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon     And I have to be there before daybreak     Oh I cannot be missing     The lads'll expect me     Why else would the Good Lord Himself resurrect me      For nothing'll stop me. I have to prevail     Through the teeth of this tempest     In the mouth of a gale     May the angels protect me     If all else should fail     And the last ship sails     Oh the roar of the chains     And the cracking of timbers     The noise at the end of the world in your ears     As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea     And the last ship sails   So I was born and raised in the shadow of a shipyard in a little town on the northeast coast of England. Some of my earliest memories are of giant ships blocking the end of my street  as well as the sun  for a lot of the year. Every morning as a child  I'd watch thousands of men walk down that hill to work in the shipyard. I'd watch those same men walking back home every night. It has to be said  the shipyard was not the most pleasant place to live next door to  or indeed work in. The shipyard was noisy  dangerous  highly toxic  with an appalling health and safety record. Despite that  the men and women who worked on those ships were extraordinarily proud of the work they did  and justifiably so. Some of the largest vessels ever constructed on planet Earth were built right at the end of my street. My grandfather had been a shipwright  and as a child  as there were few other jobs in the town  I would wonder with some anxiety whether that would be my destiny too. I was fairly determined that it wouldn't be. I had other dreams  not necessarily practical ones  but at the age of eight  I was bequeathed a guitar. It was a battered old thing with five rusty strings  and was out of tune  but quickly I learned to play it and realized that I'd found a friend for life  an accomplice  a co conspirator in my plan to escape from this surreal industrial landscape. Well  they say if you dream something hard enough  it will come to pass. Either that  or I was extremely lucky  but this was my dream. I dreamt I would leave this town  and just like those ships  once they were launched  I'd never come back. I dreamt I'd become a writer of songs  that I would sing those songs to vast numbers of people all over the world  that I would be paid extravagant amounts of money  that I'd become famous  that I'd marry a beautiful woman  have children  raise a family  buy a big house in the country  keep dogs  grow wine  have rooms full of Grammy Awards  platinum discs  and what have you. So far  so good  right   Laughter  And then one day  the songs stopped coming  and while you've suffered from periods of writer's block before  albeit briefly  this is something chronic. Day after day  you face a blank page  and nothing's coming. And those days turned to weeks  and weeks to months  and pretty soon those months have turned into years with very little to show for your efforts. No songs. So you start asking yourself questions. What have I done to offend the gods that they would abandon me so  Is the gift of songwriting taken away as easily as it seems to have been bestowed  Or perhaps there's a more    a deeper psychological reason. It was always a Faustian pact anyway. You're rewarded for revealing your innermost thoughts  your private emotions on the page for the entertainment of others  for the analysis  the scrutiny of others  and perhaps you've given enough of your privacy away. And yet  if you look at your work  could it be argued that your best work wasn't about you at all  it was about somebody else  Did your best work occur when you sidestepped your own ego and you stopped telling your story  but told someone else's story  someone perhaps without a voice  where empathetically  you stood in his shoes for a while or saw the world through his eyes  Well they say  write what you know. If you can't write about yourself anymore  then who do you write about  So it's ironic that the landscape I'd worked so hard to escape from  and the community that I'd more or less abandoned and exiled myself from should be the very landscape  the very community I would have to return to to find my missing muse. And as soon as I did that  as soon as I decided to honor the community I came from and tell their story  that the songs started to come thick and fast. I've described it as a kind of projectile vomiting  a torrent of ideas  of characters  of voices  of verses  couplets  entire songs almost formed whole  materialized in front of me as if they'd been bottled up inside me for many  many years. One of the first things I wrote was just a list of names of people I'd known  and they become characters in a kind of three dimensional drama  where they explain who they are  what they do  their hopes and their fears for the future. This is Jackie White. He's the foreman of the shipyard. My name is Jackie White  and I'm foreman of the yard  and you don't mess with Jackie on this quayside. I'm as hard as iron plate  woe betide you if you're late when we have to push a boat out on the spring tide. Now you can die and hope for heaven  but you need to work your shift  and I'd expect you all to back us to the hilt  for if St. Peter at his gate were to ask you why you're late  why  you tell him that you had to get a ship built. We build battleships and cruisers for Her Majesty the Queen  supertankers for Onassis  and all the classes in between  We built the greatest ship in tonnage what the world has ever seen   And the only life worth knowing is in the shipyard     Steel in the stockyard  iron in the soul     Would conjure up a ship     Where there used to be a hull     And we don't know what we'll do     If this yard gets sold     For the only life worth knowing is in the shipyard   So having decided to write about other people instead of myself  a further irony is that sometimes you reveal more about yourself than you'd ever intended. This song is called  Dead Man's Boots   which is an expression which describes how difficult it is to get a job  in other words  you'd only get a job in the shipyard if somebody else died. Or perhaps your father could finagle you an apprenticeship at the age of   . But sometimes a father's love can be misconstrued as controlling  and conversely  the scope of his son's ambition can seem like some pie in the sky fantasy.   You see these work boots in my hands     They'll probably fit you now  my son     Take them  they're a gift from me     Why don't you try them on      It would do your old man good to see     You walking in these boots one day     And take your place among the men     Who work upon the slipway     These dead man's boots  though they're old and curled     When a fellow needs a job and a place in the world     And it's time for a man to put down roots     And walk to the river in his old man's boots     He said   I'm dying  son  and asking     That you do one final thing for me     You're barely but a sapling  and you think that you're a tree     If you need a seed to prosper     You must first put down some roots     Just one foot then the other in     These dead man's boots      These dead man's boots  though they're old and curled     When a fellow needs a job and a place in the world     And it's time for a man to put down roots     And walk to the river in his old man's boots     I said   Why in the hell would I do that      Why would I agree       When his hand was all that I'd received     As far as I remember     It's not as if he'd spoiled me with his kindness     Up to then  you see     I'd a plan of my own and I'd quit this place     When I came of age September     These dead man's boots know their way down the hill     They could walk there themselves  and they probably will     I've plenty of choices  I've plenty other routes     And you'll never see me walking in these dead man's boots     What was it made him think     I'd be happy ending up like him     When he'd hardly got two halfpennies left     Or a broken pot to piss in      He wanted this same thing for me     Was that his final wish      He said   What the hell are you gonna do       I said   Anything but this       These dead man's boots know their way down the hill     They can walk there themselves and they probably will     But they won't walk with me  cause I'm off the other way     I've had it up to here  I'm gonna have my say     When all you've got left is that cross on the wall     I want nothing from you  I want nothing at all     Not a pension  nor a pittance  when your whole life is through     Get this through your head  I'm nothing like you     I'm done with all the arguments  there'll be no more disputes     And you'll die before you see me in your dead man's boots   Thank you. So whenever they'd launch a big ship  they would invite some dignitary up from London on the train to make a speech  break a bottle of champagne over the bows  launch it down the slipway into the river and out to sea. Occasionally on a really important ship  they'd get a member of the royal family to come  Duke of Edinburgh  Princess Anne or somebody. And you have to remember  it wasn't that long ago that the royal family in England were considered to have magical healing powers. Sick children were held up in crowds to try and touch the cloak of the king or the queen to cure them of some terrible disease. It wasn't like that in my day  but we still got very excited. So it's a launch day  it's a Saturday  and my mother has dressed me up in my Sunday best. I'm not very happy with her. All the kids are out in the street  and we have little Union Jacks to wave  and at the top of the hill  there's a motorcycle cortege appears. In the middle of the motorcycles  there's a big  black Rolls Royce. Inside the Rolls Royce is the Queen Mother. This is a big deal. So the procession is moving at a stately pace down my street  and as it approaches my house  I start to wave my flag vigorously  and there is the Queen Mother. I see her  and she seems to see me. She acknowledges me. She waves  and she smiles. And I wave my flag even more vigorously. We're having a moment  me and the Queen Mother. She's acknowledged me. And then she's gone. Well  I wasn't cured of anything. It was the opposite  actually. I was infected. I was infected with an idea. I don't belong in this street. I don't want to live in that house. I don't want to end up in that shipyard. I want to be in that car.  Laughter  I want a bigger life. I want a life beyond this town. I want a life that's out of the ordinary. It's my right. It's my right as much as hers. And so here I am at TED  I suppose to tell that story  and I think it's appropriate to say the obvious that there's a symbiotic and intrinsic link between storytelling and community  between community and art  between community and science and technology  between community and economics. It's my belief that abstract economic theory that denies the needs of community or denies the contribution that community makes to economy is shortsighted  cruel and untenable. The fact is  whether you're a rock star or whether you're a welder in a shipyard  or a tribesman in the upper Amazon  or the queen of England  at the end of the day  we're all in the same boat.   Aye  the footmen are frantic in their indignation     You see the queen's took a taxi herself to the station     Where the porters  surprised by her lack of royal baggage     Bustle her and three corgis to the rear of the carriage     For the train it is crammed with all Europe's nobility     And there's none of them famous for their compatibility     There's a fight over seats      I beg pardon  Your Grace     But you'll find that one's mine  so get back in your place        Aye  but where are they going       All the porters debate      Why they're going to Newcastle and they daren't be late     For they're launching a boat on the Tyne at high tide     And they've come from all over  from far and from wide      There's the old Dalai Lama     And the pontiff of Rome     Every palace in Europe  and there's nay bugger home     There's the Duchess of Cornwall and the loyal Prince of Wales     Looking crushed and uncomfortable in his top hat and tails     Well  they haven't got tickets     Come now  it's just a detail     There was no time to purchase and one simply has to prevail     For we'll get to the shipyards or we'll end up in jail      When the last ship sails     Oh the roar of the chains     And the cracking of timbers     The noise at the end of the world in your ears     As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea     And the last ship sails     And whatever you'd promised     Whatever you've done     And whatever the station in life you've become     In the name of the Father  in the name of the Son     And no matter the weave of this life that you've spun     On the Earth or in Heaven or under the Sun     When the last ship sails     Oh the roar of the chains     And the cracking of timbers     The noise at the end of the world in your ears     As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea     And the last ship sails   Thanks very much for listening to my song. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Okay  you have to join in if you know it.

It's a story of the neocortex  which means  new rind.  So in these early mammals  because only mammals have a neocortex  rodent like creatures. It was the size of a postage stamp and just as thin  and was a thin covering around their walnut sized brain  but it was capable of a new type of thinking. Rather than the fixed behaviors that non mammalian animals have  it could invent new behaviors. So a mouse is escaping a predator  its path is blocked  it'll try to invent a new solution. That may work  it may not  but if it does  it will remember that and have a new behavior  and that can actually spread virally through the rest of the community. Another mouse watching this could say   Hey  that was pretty clever  going around that rock   and it could adopt a new behavior as well. Non mammalian animals couldn't do any of those things. They had fixed behaviors. Now they could learn a new behavior but not in the course of one lifetime. In the course of maybe a thousand lifetimes  it could evolve a new fixed behavior. That was perfectly okay     million years ago. The environment changed very slowly. It could take        years for there to be a significant environmental change  and during that period of time it would evolve a new behavior. Now that went along fine  but then something happened. Sixty five million years ago  there was a sudden  violent change to the environment. We call it the Cretaceous extinction event. That's when the dinosaurs went extinct  that's when    percent of the animal and plant species went extinct  and that's when mammals overtook their ecological niche  and to anthropomorphize  biological evolution said   Hmm  this neocortex is pretty good stuff   and it began to grow it. And mammals got bigger  their brains got bigger at an even faster pace  and the neocortex got bigger even faster than that and developed these distinctive ridges and folds basically to increase its surface area. If you took the human neocortex and stretched it out  it's about the size of a table napkin  and it's still a thin structure. It's about the thickness of a table napkin. But it has so many convolutions and ridges it's now    percent of our brain  and that's where we do our thinking  and it's the great sublimator. We still have that old brain that provides our basic drives and motivations  but I may have a drive for conquest  and that'll be sublimated by the neocortex into writing a poem or inventing an app or giving a TED Talk  and it's really the neocortex that's where the action is. Fifty years ago  I wrote a paper describing how I thought the brain worked  and I described it as a series of modules. Each module could do things with a pattern. It could learn a pattern. It could remember a pattern. It could implement a pattern. And these modules were organized in hierarchies  and we created that hierarchy with our own thinking. And there was actually very little to go on    years ago. It led me to meet President Johnson. I've been thinking about this for    years  and a year and a half ago I came out with the book  How To Create A Mind   which has the same thesis  but now there's a plethora of evidence. The amount of data we're getting about the brain from neuroscience is doubling every year. Spatial resolution of brainscanning of all types is doubling every year. We can now see inside a living brain and see individual interneural connections connecting in real time  firing in real time. We can see your brain create your thoughts. We can see your thoughts create your brain  which is really key to how it works. So let me describe briefly how it works. I've actually counted these modules. We have about     million of them  and we create them in these hierarchies. I'll give you a simple example. I've got a bunch of modules that can recognize the crossbar to a capital A  and that's all they care about. A beautiful song can play  a pretty girl could walk by  they don't care  but they see a crossbar to a capital A  they get very excited and they say  crossbar   and they put out a high probability on their output axon. That goes to the next level  and these layers are organized in conceptual levels. Each is more abstract than the next one  so the next one might say  capital A.  That goes up to a higher level that might say  Apple.  Information flows down also. If the apple recognizer has seen A P P L  it'll think to itself   Hmm  I think an E is probably likely   and it'll send a signal down to all the E recognizers saying   Be on the lookout for an E  I think one might be coming.  The E recognizers will lower their threshold and they see some sloppy thing  could be an E. Ordinarily you wouldn't think so  but we're expecting an E  it's good enough  and yeah  I've seen an E  and then apple says   Yeah  I've seen an Apple.  Go up another five levels  and you're now at a pretty high level of this hierarchy  and stretch down into the different senses  and you may have a module that sees a certain fabric  hears a certain voice quality  smells a certain perfume  and will say   My wife has entered the room.  Go up another    levels  and now you're at a very high level. You're probably in the frontal cortex  and you'll have modules that say   That was ironic. That's funny. She's pretty.  You might think that those are more sophisticated  but actually what's more complicated is the hierarchy beneath them. There was a    year old girl  she had brain surgery  and she was conscious because the surgeons wanted to talk to her. You can do that because there's no pain receptors in the brain. And whenever they stimulated particular  very small points on her neocortex  shown here in red  she would laugh. So at first they thought they were triggering some kind of laugh reflex  but no  they quickly realized they had found the points in her neocortex that detect humor  and she just found everything hilarious whenever they stimulated these points.  You guys are so funny just standing around   was the typical comment  and they weren't funny  not while doing surgery. So how are we doing today  Well  computers are actually beginning to master human language with techniques that are similar to the neocortex. I actually described the algorithm  which is similar to something called a hierarchical hidden Markov model  something I've worked on since the '  s.  Jeopardy  is a very broad natural language game  and Watson got a higher score than the best two players combined. It got this query correct   A long  tiresome speech delivered by a frothy pie topping   and it quickly responded   What is a meringue harangue   And Jennings and the other guy didn't get that. It's a pretty sophisticated example of computers actually understanding human language  and it actually got its knowledge by reading Wikipedia and several other encyclopedias. Five to    years from now  search engines will actually be based on not just looking for combinations of words and links but actually understanding  reading for understanding the billions of pages on the web and in books. So you'll be walking along  and Google will pop up and say   You know  Mary  you expressed concern to me a month ago that your glutathione supplement wasn't getting past the blood brain barrier. Well  new research just came out    seconds ago that shows a whole new approach to that and a new way to take glutathione. Let me summarize it for you.  Twenty years from now  we'll have nanobots  because another exponential trend is the shrinking of technology. They'll go into our brain through the capillaries and basically connect our neocortex to a synthetic neocortex in the cloud providing an extension of our neocortex. Now today  I mean  you have a computer in your phone  but if you need        computers for a few seconds to do a complex search  you can access that for a second or two in the cloud. In the     s  if you need some extra neocortex  you'll be able to connect to that in the cloud directly from your brain. So I'm walking along and I say   Oh  there's Chris Anderson. He's coming my way. I'd better think of something clever to say. I've got three seconds. My     million modules in my neocortex isn't going to cut it. I need a billion more.  I'll be able to access that in the cloud. And our thinking  then  will be a hybrid of biological and non biological thinking  but the non biological portion is subject to my law of accelerating returns. It will grow exponentially. And remember what happens the last time we expanded our neocortex  That was two million years ago when we became humanoids and developed these large foreheads. Other primates have a slanted brow. They don't have the frontal cortex. But the frontal cortex is not really qualitatively different. It's a quantitative expansion of neocortex  but that additional quantity of thinking was the enabling factor for us to take a qualitative leap and invent language and art and science and technology and TED conferences. No other species has done that. And so  over the next few decades  we're going to do it again. We're going to again expand our neocortex  only this time we won't be limited by a fixed architecture of enclosure. It'll be expanded without limit. That additional quantity will again be the enabling factor for another qualitative leap in culture and technology. Thank you very much. At every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we're going to become  and then when we become those people  we're not always thrilled with the decisions we made. So young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get. Middle aged people rushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry. Older adults work hard to lose what middle aged adults worked hard to gain. On and on and on. The question is  as a psychologist  that fascinates me is  why do we make decisions that our future selves so often regret  Now  I think one of the reasons    I'll try to convince you today   is that we have a fundamental misconception about the power of time. Every one of you knows that the rate of change slows over the human lifespan  that your children seem to change by the minute but your parents seem to change by the year. But what is the name of this magical point in life where change suddenly goes from a gallop to a crawl  Is it teenage years  Is it middle age  Is it old age  The answer  it turns out  for most people  is now  wherever now happens to be. What I want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion  an illusion that history  our personal history  has just come to an end  that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives. Let me give you some data to back up that claim. So here's a study of change in people's personal values over time. Here's three values. Everybody here holds all of them  but you probably know that as you grow  as you age  the balance of these values shifts. So how does it do so  Well  we asked thousands of people. We asked half of them to predict for us how much their values would change in the next    years  and the others to tell us how much their values had changed in the last    years. And this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis  because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people  say     years old  to the reports of people who were     and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan. Here's what we found. First of all  you are right  change does slow down as we age  but second  you're wrong  because it doesn't slow nearly as much as we think. At every age  from    to    in our data set  people vastly underestimated how much change they would experience over the next    years. We call this the  end of history  illusion. To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect  you can connect these two lines  and what you see here is that    year olds anticipate changing only as much as    year olds actually do. Now it's not just values. It's all sorts of other things. For example  personality. Many of you know that psychologists now claim that there are five fundamental dimensions of personality  neuroticism  openness to experience  agreeableness  extraversion  and conscientiousness. Again  we asked people how much they expected to change over the next    years  and also how much they had changed over the last    years  and what we found  well  you're going to get used to seeing this diagram over and over  because once again the rate of change does slow as we age  but at every age  people underestimate how much their personalities will change in the next decade. And it isn't just ephemeral things like values and personality. You can ask people about their likes and dislikes  their basic preferences. For example  name your best friend  your favorite kind of vacation  what's your favorite hobby  what's your favorite kind of music. People can name these things. We ask half of them to tell us   Do you think that that will change over the next    years   and half of them to tell us   Did that change over the last    years   And what we find  well  you've seen it twice now  and here it is again  people predict that the friend they have now is the friend they'll have in    years  the vacation they most enjoy now is the one they'll enjoy in    years  and yet  people who are    years older all say   Eh  you know  that's really changed.  Does any of this matter  Is this just a form of mis prediction that doesn't have consequences  No  it matters quite a bit  and I'll give you an example of why. It bedevils our decision making in important ways. Bring to mind right now for yourself your favorite musician today and your favorite musician    years ago. I put mine up on the screen to help you along. Now we asked people to predict for us  to tell us how much money they would pay right now to see their current favorite musician perform in concert    years from now  and on average  people said they would pay     dollars for that ticket. And yet  when we asked them how much they would pay to see the person who was their favorite    years ago perform today  they say only    dollars. Now  in a perfectly rational world  these should be the same number  but we overpay for the opportunity to indulge our current preferences because we overestimate their stability. Why does this happen  We're not entirely sure  but it probably has to do with the ease of remembering versus the difficulty of imagining. Most of us can remember who we were    years ago  but we find it hard to imagine who we're going to be  and then we mistakenly think that because it's hard to imagine  it's not likely to happen. Sorry  when people say  I can't imagine that   they're usually talking about their own lack of imagination  and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they're describing. The bottom line is  time is a powerful force. It transforms our preferences. It reshapes our values. It alters our personalities. We seem to appreciate this fact  but only in retrospect. Only when we look backwards do we realize how much change happens in a decade. It's as if  for most of us  the present is a magic time. It's a watershed on the timeline. It's the moment at which we finally become ourselves. Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they're finished. The person you are right now is as transient  as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you've ever been. The one constant in our life is change. Thank you. I read poetry all the time and write about it frequently and take poems apart to see how they work because I'm a word person. I understand the world best  most fully  in words rather than  say  pictures or numbers  and when I have a new experience or a new feeling  I'm a little frustrated until I can try to put it into words. I think I've always been that way. I devoured science fiction as a child. I still do. And I found poems by Andrew Marvell and Matthew Arnold and Emily Dickinson and William Butler Yeats because they were quoted in science fiction  and I loved their sounds and I went on to read about ottava rima and medial caesuras and enjambment and all that other technical stuff that you care about if you already care about poems  because poems already made me happier and sadder and more alive. And I became a poetry critic because I wanted to know how and why. Now  poetry isn't one thing that serves one purpose any more than music or computer programming serve one purpose. The greek word poem  it just means  a made thing   and poetry is a set of techniques  ways of making patterns that put emotions into words. The more techniques you know  the more things you can make  and the more patterns you can recognize in things you might already like or love. That said  poetry does seem to be especially good at certain things. For example  we are all going to die. Poetry can help us live with that. Poems are made of words  nothing but words. The particulars in poems are like the particularities  the personalities  that distinguish people from one another. Poems are easy to share  easy to pass on  and when you read a poem  you can imagine someone's speaking to you or for you  maybe even someone far away or someone made up or someone deceased. That's why we can go to poems when we want to remember something or someone  to celebrate or to look beyond death or to say goodbye  and that's one reason poems can seem important  even to people who aren't me  who don't so much live in a world of words. The poet Frank O'Hara said   If you don't need poetry  bully for you   but he also said when he didn't want to be alive anymore  the thought that he wouldn't write any more poems had stopped him. Poetry helps me want to be alive  and I want to show you why by showing you how  how a couple of poems react to the fact that we're alive in one place at one time in one culture  and in another we won't be alive at all. So here's one of the first poems I memorized. It could address a child or an adult.  From far  from eve and morning From yon twelve winded sky  The stuff of life to knit me Blew hither  here am I. Now   for a breath I tarry Nor yet disperse apart   Take my hand quick and tell me  What have you in your heart. Speak now  and I will answer  How shall I help you  say  Ere to the wind's twelve quarters I take my endless way.   A. E. Housman  Now  this poem has appealed to science fiction writers. It's furnished at least three science fiction titles  I think because it says poems can brings us news from the future or the past or across the world  because their patterns can seem to tell you what's in somebody's heart. It says poems can bring people together temporarily  which I think is true  and it sticks in my head not just because it rhymes but for how it rhymes  cleanly and simply on the two and four   say  and  way   with anticipatory hints on the one and three   answer  and  quarters   as if the poem itself were coming together. It plays up the fact that we die by exaggerating the speed of our lives. A few years on Earth become one speech  one breath. It's a poem about loneliness    the  I  in the poem feels no connection will last   and it might look like a plea for help 'til you get to the word  help   where this  I  facing you  taking your hand  is more like a teacher or a genie  or at least that's what he wants to believe. It would not be the first time a poet had written the poem that he wanted to hear. Now  this next poem really changed what I liked and what I read and what I felt I could read as an adult. It might not make any sense to you if you haven't seen it before.  The Garden   Oleander  coral from lipstick ads in the   's. Fruit of the tree of such knowledge To smack  thin air  meaning kiss or hit. It appears in the guise of outworn usages because we are bad  Big masculine threat  insinuating and slangy.   Rae Armantrout  Now  I found this poem in an anthology of almost equally confusing poems in     . I just heard that there were these scandalous writers called Language poets who didn't make any sense  and I wanted to go and see for myself what they were like  and some of them didn't do much for me  but this writer  Rae Armantrout  did an awful lot  and I kept reading her until I felt I knew what was going on  as I do with this poem. It's about the Garden of Eden and the Fall and the Biblical story of the Fall  in which sex as we know it and death and guilt come into the world at the same time. It's also about how appearances deceive  how our culture can sweep us along into doing and saying things we didn't intend or don't like  and Armantrout's style is trying to help us stop or slow down.  Smack  can mean  kiss  as in air kisses  as in lip smacking  but that can lead to  smack  as in  hit  as in domestic abuse  because sexual attraction can seem threatening. The red that means fertility can also mean poison. Oleander is poisonous. And outworn usages like  smack  for  kiss  or  hit  can help us see how our unacknowledged assumptions can make us believe we are bad  either because sex is sinful or because we tolerate so much sexism. We let guys tell women what to do. The poem reacts to old lipstick ads  and its edginess about statement  its reversals and halts  have everything to do with resisting the language of ads that want to tell us so easily what to want  what to do  what to think. That resistance is a lot of the point of the poem  which shows me  Armantrout shows me what it's like to hear grave threats and mortal dishonesty in the language of everyday life  and once she's done that  I think she can show other people  women and men  what it's like to feel that way and say to other people  women and men who feel so alienated or so threatened that they're not alone. Now  how do I know that I'm right about this somewhat confusing poem  Well in this case  I emailed the poet a draft of my talk and she said   Yeah  yeah  that's about it.  Yeah.  Laughter   Applause  But usually  you can't know. You never know. You can't be sure  and that's okay. All we can do we is listen to poems and look at poems and guess and see if they can bring us what we need  and if you're wrong about some part of a poem  nothing bad will happen. Now  this next poem is older than Armantrout's  but a little younger than A. E. Housman's.  The Brave Man   The sun  that brave man  Comes through boughs that lie in wait  That brave man. Green and gloomy eyes In dark forms of the grass Run away. The good stars  Pale helms and spiky spurs  Run away. Fears of my bed  Fears of life and fears of death  Run away. That brave man comes up From below and walks without meditation  That brave man.   Wallace Stevens  Now  the sun in this poem  in Wallace Stevens' poem  seems so grave because the person in the poem is so afraid. The sun comes up in the morning through branches  dispels the dew  the eyes  on the grass  and defeats stars envisioned as armies.  Brave  has its old sense of showy as well as its modern sense  courage. This sun is not afraid to show his face. But the person in the poem is afraid. He might have been up all night. That is the reveal Stevens saves for that fourth stanza  where run away has become a refrain. This person might want to run away too  but fortified by the sun's example  he might just rise. Stevens saves that sonically odd word  meditation  for the end. Unlike the sun  human beings think. We meditate on past and future  life and death  above and below. And it can make us afraid. Poems  the patterns in poems  show us not just what somebody thought or what someone did or what happened but what it was like to be a person like that  to be so anxious  so lonely  so inquisitive  so goofy  so preposterous  so brave. That's why poems can seem at once so durable  so personal  and so ephemeral  like something inside and outside you at once. The Scottish poet Denise Riley compares poetry to a needle  a sliver of outside I cradle inside  and the American poet Terrance Hayes wrote six poems called  Wind in a Box.  One of them asks   Tell me  what am I going to do when I'm dead   And the answer is that he'll stay with us or won't stay with us inside us as wind  as air  as words. It is easier than ever to find poems that might stay inside you  that might stay with you  from long  long ago  or from right this minute  from far away or from right close to where you live  almost no matter where you live. Poems can help you say  help you show how you're feeling  but they can also introduce you to feelings  ways of being in the world  people  very much unlike you  maybe even people from long  long ago. Some poems even tell you that that is what they can do. That's what John Keats is doing in his most mysterious  perhaps  poem. It's mysterious because it's probably unfinished  he probably left it unfinished  and because it might be meant for a character in a play  but it might just be Keats' thinking about what his own writing  his handwriting  could do  and in it I hear  at least I hear  mortality  and I hear the power of older poetic techniques  and I have the feeling  you might have the feeling  of meeting even for an instant  almost becoming  someone else from long ago  someone quite memorable.  This living hand  now warm and capable Of earnest grasping  would  if it were cold And in the icy silence of the tomb  So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights That thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood So in my veins red life might stream again  And thou be conscience calm d    see here it is    I hold it towards you.  Thanks. Even nature's most disgusting creatures have important secrets  but who would want a swarm of cockroaches coming towards them  Yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates to robustness. Robust systems are stable in complex and new environments. Remarkably  cockroaches can self stabilize running over rough terrain. When we put a jet pack on them  or give them a perturbation like an earthquake  we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self stabilize without using any of their brainpower. They can go over complex terrain like grass  no problem  and not get destabilized. We discovered a new behavior where  because of their shape  they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test bit of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered. The animals rapidly invert and disappear in less than     milliseconds   you never see them   using the same structures that they use to run  their legs. They can run upside down very rapidly on rods  branches and wires  and if you perturb one of those branches  they can do this. They can perform gymnastic maneuvers like no robot we have yet. And they have nearly unlimited maneuverability with that same structure and unprecedented access to a variety of different areas. They have wings for flying when they get warm  but they use those same wings to flip over if they get destabilized. Very effective. Robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail safe. This is the foot of a cockroach. It has spines  gluey pads and claws  but if you take off those feet  they can still go over rough terrain  like the bottom video that you see  without hardly slowing down. Extraordinary. They can run up mesh without their feet. Here's an animal using a normal  alternating tripod  three legs  three legs  three legs  but in nature  the insects often have lost their legs. Here's one moving with two middle legs gone. It can even lose three legs  in a tripod  and adopt a new gait  a hopping gait. And I point out that all of these videos are slowed down    times  so they're actually really fast  when you see this. Robust systems are also damage resistant. Here's an animal climbing up a wall. It looks like a rapid  smooth  vertical climb  but when you slow it down  you see something very different. Here's what they do. They intentionally have a head on collision with the wall so they don't slow down and can transition up it in    milliseconds. And they can do this in part because they have extraordinary exoskeletons. And they're really just made up of compliant joints that are tubes and plates connected to one another. Here's a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach. You see these plates  and you see the compliant membrane. My engineering colleague at Berkeley designed with his students a novel manufacturing technique where you essentially origami the exoskeleton  you laser cut it  laminate it  and you fold it up into a robot. And you can do that now in less than    minutes. These robots  called DASH  for Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod  are highly compliant robots  and they're remarkably robust as a result of these features. They're certainly incredibly damage resistant. They even have some of the behaviors of the cockroaches. So they can use their smart  compliant body to transition up a wall in a very simple way. They even have some of the beginnings of the rapid inversion behavior where they disappear. Now we want to know why they can go anywhere. We discovered that they can go through three millimeter gaps  the height of two pennies  two stacked pennies  and when they do this  they can actually run through those confined spaces at high speeds  although you never see it. To understand it better  we did a CT scan of the exoskeleton and showed that they can compress their body by over    percent. We put them in a materials testing machine to look at the stress strain analysis and showed that they can withstand forces     times their body weight  and after this they can fly and run absolutely normally. So you never know where curiosity based research will lead  and someday you may want a swarm of cockroach inspired robots to come at you. Thank you. Election night      was a night that tore me in half. It was the night that Barack Obama was elected.  One hundred and forty three   years after the end of slavery  and      years after the passage of the Voting Rights Act  an African American was elected president. Many of us never thought that this was possible until the moment that it happened. And in many ways  it was the climax of the black civil rights movement in the United States. I was in California that night  which was ground zero at the time for another movement  the marriage equality movement. Gay marriage was on the ballot in the form of Proposition    and as the election returns started to come in  it became clear that the right for same sex couples to marry  which had recently been granted by the California courts  was going to be taken away. So on the same night that Barack Obama won his historic presidency  the lesbian and gay community suffered one of our most painful defeats. And then it got even worse. Pretty much immediately  African Americans started to be blamed for the passage of Proposition  . This was largely due to an incorrect poll that said that blacks had voted for the measure by something like    percent. This turned out not to be true  but this idea of pervasive black homophobia set in  and was grabbed on by the media. I couldn't tear myself away from the coverage. I listened to some gay commentator say that the African American community was notoriously homophobic  and now that civil rights had been achieved for us  we wanted to take away other people's rights. There were even reports of racist epithets being thrown at some of the participants of the gay rights rallies that took place after the election. And on the other side  some African Americans dismissed or ignored homophobia that was indeed real in our community. And others resented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights  and once again  the sinking feeling that two minority groups of which I'm both a part of were competing with each other instead of supporting each other overwhelmed and  frankly  pissed me off. Now  I'm a documentary filmmaker  so after going through my pissed off stage and yelling at the television and radio  my next instinct was to make a movie. And what guided me in making this film was  how was this happening  How was it that the gay rights movement was being pitted against the civil rights movement  And this wasn't just an abstract question. I'm a beneficiary of both movements  so this was actually personal. But then something else happened after that election in     . The march towards gay equality accelerated at a pace that surprised and shocked everyone  and is still reshaping our laws and our policies  our institutions and our entire country. And so it started to become increasingly clear to me that this pitting of the two movements against each other actually didn't make sense  and that they were in fact much  much more interconnected  and that  in fact  some of the way that the gay rights movement has been able to make such incredible gains so quickly is that it's used some of the same tactics and strategies that were first laid down by the civil rights movement. Let's just look at a few of these strategies. First off  it's really interesting to see  to actually visually see  how quick the gay rights movement has made its gains  if you look at a few of the major events on a timeline of both freedom movements. Now  there are tons of milestones in the civil rights movement  but the first one we're going to start with is the      Montgomery bus boycott. This was a protest campaign against Montgomery  Alabama's segregation on their public transit system  and it began when a woman named Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white person. The campaign lasted a year  and it galvanized the civil rights movement like nothing had before it. And I call this strategy the  I'm tired of your foot on my neck  strategy. So gays and lesbians have been in society since societies began  but up until the mid   th century  homosexual acts were still illegal in most states. So just    years after the Montgomery bus boycott  a group of LGBT folks took that same strategy. It's known as Stonewall  in       and it's where a group of LGBT patrons fought back against police beatings at a Greenwich Village bar that sparked three days of rioting. Incidentally  black and latino LGBT folks were at the forefront of this rebellion  and it's a really interesting example of the intersection of our struggles against racism  homophobia  gender identity and police brutality. After Stonewall happened  gay liberation groups sprang up all over the country  and the modern gay rights  movement as we know it took off. So the next moment to look at on the timeline is the      March on Washington. This was a seminal event in the civil rights movement and it's where African Americans called for both civil and economic justice. And it's of course where Martin Luther King delivered his famous  I have a dream  speech  but what's actually less known is that this march was organized by a man named Bayard Rustin. Bayard was an out gay man  and he's considered one of the most brilliant strategists of the civil rights movement. He later in his life became a fierce advocate of LGBT rights as well  and his life is testament to the intersection of the struggles. The March on Washington is one of the high points of the movement  and it's where there was a fervent belief that African Americans too could be a part of American democracy. I call this strategy the  We are visible and many in numbers  strategy. Some early gay activists were actually directly inspired by the march  and some had taken part. Gay pioneer Jack Nichols said   We marched with Martin Luther King  seven of us from the Mattachine Society     which was an early gay rights organization    and from that moment on  we had our own dream about a gay rights march of similar proportions.  Several years later  a series of marches took place  each one gaining the momentum of the gay freedom struggle. The first one was in       and the second one took place in     . The third one was held in     . Almost a million people showed up  and people were so energized and excited by what had taken place  they went back to their own communities and started their own political and social organizations  further increasing the visibility of the movement. The day of that march  October     was then declared National Coming Out Day  and is still celebrated all over the world. These marches set the groundwork for the historic changes that we see happening today in the United States. And lastly  the  Loving  strategy. The name speaks for itself. In       the Supreme Court ruled in Loving v. Virginia  and invalidated all laws that prohibited interracial marriage. This is considered one of the Supreme Court's landmark civil rights cases. In       President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act  known as DOMA  and that made the federal government only have to recognize marriages between a man and a woman. In United States v. Windsor  a    year old lesbian named Edith Windsor sued the federal government when she was forced to pay estate taxes on her deceased wife's property  something that heterosexual  couples don't have to do. And as the case wound its way through the lower courts  the Loving case was repeatedly cited as precedent. When it got to the Supreme Court in       the Supreme Court agreed  and DOMA was thrown out. It was incredible. But the gay marriage movement has been making gains for years now. To date     states have passed laws allowing marriage equality. It's become the de facto battle for gay equality  and it seems like daily  laws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts  even in places like Texas and Utah  which no one saw coming. So a lot has changed since that night in      when I felt torn in half. I did go on to make that film. It's a documentary film  and it's called  The New Black   and it looks at how the African American community is grappling with the gay rights issue in light of the gay marriage movement and this fight over the meaning of civil rights. And I wanted to capture some of this incredible change that was happening  and as luck or politics would have it  another marriage battle started gearing up  this time in Maryland  where African Americans make up    percent of the electorate. So this tension between gay rights and civil rights started to bubble up once again  and I was lucky enough to capture how some people were making the connection between the movements this time. This is a clip of Karess Taylor Hughes and Samantha Masters  two characters in the film  as they hit the streets of Baltimore and try to convince potential voters. Okay  are you registered to vote  Man  No. Karess Taylor Hughes  Okay. How old are you  Man    . KTH      You gotta get registered to vote. We got to get you registered to vote. Man  I ain't voting on no gay shit. SM  Okay  why  What's up  Man  I ain't with that. SM  That's not cool. Man  What made you be gay  SM  So what made you be straight  So what made you be straight  Man    You can't answer that question.  Laughter  KSM  I used to not have the same rights as you  but I know that because a black man like yourself stood up for a woman like me  I know that I've got the same opportunities. So you  as a black man  have the opportunity to stand up for somebody else. Whether you're gay or not  these are your brothers and sisters out here  and they need you to represent. Man    Who is you to tell somebody who they can't have sex with  who they can't be with  They ain't got that power. Nobody has that power to say  you can't marry that young lady. Who has that power  Nobody. SM  But you know what  Our state has put the power in your hands  and so what we need you to do is vote for  you gonna vote for  . Man    I got you. SM  Vote for    okay  Man    I got you. KSM  All right  do y'all need community service hours  You do  All right  you can always volunteer with us to get community service hours. Y'all want to do that  We feed you. We bring you pizza. Yoruba Richen  Thank you. What's amazing to me about that clip that we just captured as we were filming is  it really shows how Karess understands the history of the civil rights movement  but she's not restricted by it. She doesn't just limit it to black people. She sees it as a blueprint for expanding rights to gays and lesbians. Maybe because she's younger  she's like     she's able to do this a little bit more easily  but the fact is that Maryland voters did pass that marriage equality amendment  and in fact it was the first time that marriage equality was directly voted on and passed by the voters. African Americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded. It was a complete turnaround from that night in      when Proposition   was passed. It was  and feels  monumental. We in the LGBT community have gone from being a pathologized and reviled and criminalized group to being seen as part of the great human quest for dignity and equality. We've gone from having to hide our sexuality in order to maintain our jobs and our families to literally getting a place at the table with the president and a shout out at his second inauguration. I just want to read what he said at that inauguration   We the people declare today that the most evident of truths  that all of us are created equal. It is the star that guides us still  just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall.  Now we know that everything is not perfect  especially when you look at what's happening with the LGBT rights issue internationally  but it says something about how far we've come when our president puts the gay freedom struggle in the context of the other great freedom struggles of our time  the women's rights movement and the civil rights movement. His statement demonstrates not only the interconnectedness of those movements  but how each one borrowed and was inspired by the other. So just as Martin Luther King learned from and borrowed from Gandhi's tactics of civil disobedience and nonviolence  which became a bedrock of the civil rights movement  the gay rights movement saw what worked in the civil rights movement  and they used some of those same strategies and tactics to make gains at an even quicker pace. Maybe one more other reason for the relative quick progress of the gay rights movement. Whereas a lot of us continue to still live in racially segregated spaces  LGBT folks  we are everywhere. We are in urban communities and rural communities  communities of color  immigrant communities  churches and mosques and synagogues. We are your mothers and brothers and sisters and sons. And when someone that you love or a family member comes out  it may be easier to support their quest for equality. And in fact  the gay rights movement asks us to support justice and equality from a space of love. That may be the biggest  greatest gift that the movement has given us. It calls on us to access that which is most universal and most intimate  a love of our brother and our sister and our neighbor. I just want to end with a quote by one of our greatest freedom fighters who's no longer with us  Nelson Mandela of South Africa. Nelson Mandela led South Africa after the dark and brutal days of Apartheid  and out of the ashes of that  legalized racial discrimination  he led South Africa to become the first country in the world to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation within its constitution. Mandela said   For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains  but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.  So as these movements continue on  and as freedom struggles around the world continue on  let's remember that not only are they interconnected  but they must support and enhance each other for us to be truly victorious. Thank you. I grew up in a very small country town in Victoria. I had a very normal  low key kind of upbringing. I went to school  I hung out with my friends  I fought with my younger sisters. It was all very normal. And when I was     a member of my local community approached my parents and wanted to nominate me for a community achievement award. And my parents said   Hm  that's really nice  but there's kind of one glaring problem with that. She hasn't actually achieved anything.   Laughter  And they were right  you know. I went to school  I got good marks  I had a very low key after school job in my mum's hairdressing salon  and I spent a lot of time watching  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  and  Dawson's Creek.  Yeah  I know. What a contradiction. But they were right  you know. I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary at all. I wasn't doing anything that could be considered an achievement if you took disability out of the equation. Years later  I was on my second teaching round in a Melbourne high school  and I was about    minutes into a year    legal studies class when this boy put up his hand and said   Hey miss  when are you going to start doing your speech   And I said   What speech   You know  I'd been talking them about defamation law for a good    minutes. And he said   You know  like  your motivational speaking. You know  when people in wheelchairs come to school  they usually say  like  inspirational stuff    It's usually in the big hall.  And that's when it dawned on me  This kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects of inspiration. We are not  to this kid    and it's not his fault  I mean  that's true for many of us. For lots of us  disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our manicurists. We're not real people. We are there to inspire. And in fact  I am sitting on this stage looking like I do in this wheelchair  and you are probably kind of expecting me to inspire you. Right   Laughter  Yeah. Well  ladies and gentlemen  I'm afraid I'm going to disappoint you dramatically. I am not here to inspire you. I am here to tell you that we have been lied to about disability. Yeah  we've been sold the lie that disability is a Bad Thing  capital B  capital T. It's a bad thing  and to live with a disability makes you exceptional. It's not a bad thing  and it doesn't make you exceptional. And in the past few years  we've been able to propagate this lie even further via social media. You may have seen images like this one   The only disability in life is a bad attitude.  Or this one   Your excuse is invalid.  Indeed. Or this one   Before you quit  try   These are just a couple of examples  but there are a lot of these images out there. You know  you might have seen the one  the little girl with no hands drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth. You might have seen a child running on carbon fiber prosthetic legs. And these images  there are lots of them out there  they are what we call inspiration porn. And I use the term porn deliberately  because they objectify one group of people for the benefit of another group of people. So in this case  we're objectifying disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people. The purpose of these images is to inspire you  to motivate you  so that we can look at them and think   Well  however bad my life is  it could be worse. I could be that person.  But what if you are that person  I've lost count of the number of times that I've been approached by strangers wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave or inspirational  and this was long before my work had any kind of public profile. They were just kind of congratulating me for managing to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  Laughter  And it is objectifying. These images  those images objectify disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people. They are there so that you can look at them and think that things aren't so bad for you  to put your worries into perspective. And life as a disabled person is actually somewhat difficult. We do overcome some things. But the things that we're overcoming are not the things that you think they are. They are not things to do with our bodies. I use the term  disabled people  quite deliberately  because I subscribe to what's called the social model of disability  which tells us that we are more disabled by the society that we live in than by our bodies and our diagnoses. So I have lived in this body a long time. I'm quite fond of it. It does the things that I need it to do  and I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity just as you have  and that's the thing about those kids in those pictures as well. They're not doing anything out of the ordinary. They are just using their bodies to the best of their capacity. So is it really fair to objectify them in the way that we do  to share those images  People  when they say   You're an inspiration   they mean it as a compliment. And I know why it happens. It's because of the lie  it's because we've been sold this lie that disability makes you exceptional. And it honestly doesn't. And I know what you're thinking. You know  I'm up here bagging out inspiration  and you're thinking   Jeez  Stella  aren't you inspired sometimes by some things   And the thing is  I am. I learn from other disabled people all the time. I'm learning not that I am luckier than them  though. I am learning that it's a genius idea to use a pair of barbecue tongs to pick up things that you dropped.  Laughter  I'm learning that nifty trick where you can charge your mobile phone battery from your chair battery. Genius. We are learning from each others' strength and endurance  not against our bodies and our diagnoses  but against a world that exceptionalizes and objectifies us. I really think that this lie that we've been sold about disability is the greatest injustice. It makes life hard for us. And that quote   The only disability in life is a bad attitude   the reason that that's bullshit is because it's just not true  because of the social model of disability. No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs has ever made it turn into a ramp. Never.  Laughter   Applause  Smiling at a television screen isn't going to make closed captions appear for people who are deaf. No amount of standing in the middle of a bookshop and radiating a positive attitude is going to turn all those books into braille. It's just not going to happen. I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception  but the norm. I want to live in a world where a    year old girl sitting in her bedroom watching  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  isn't referred to as achieving anything because she's doing it sitting down. I want to live in a world where we don't have such low expectations of disabled people that we are congratulated for getting out of bed and remembering our own names in the morning. I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement for disabled people  and I want to live in a world where a kid in year    in a Melbourne high school is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user. Disability doesn't make you exceptional  but questioning what you think you know about it does. Thank you. Four years ago  a security researcher  or  as most people would call it  a hacker  found a way to literally make ATMs throw money at him. His name was Barnaby Jack  and this technique was later called  jackpotting  in his honor. I'm here today because I think we actually need hackers. Barnaby Jack could have easily turned into a career criminal or James Bond villain with his knowledge  but he chose to show the world his research instead. He believed that sometimes you have to demo a threat to spark a solution. And I feel the same way. That's why I'm here today. We are often terrified and fascinated by the power hackers now have. They scare us. But the choices they make have dramatic outcomes that influence us all. So I am here today because I think we need hackers  and in fact  they just might be the immune system for the information age. Sometimes they make us sick  but they also find those hidden threats in our world  and they make us fix it. I knew that I might get hacked for giving this talk  so let me save you the effort. In true TED fashion  here is my most embarrassing picture. But it would be difficult for you to find me in it  because I'm the one who looks like a boy standing to the side. I was such a nerd back then that even the boys on the Dungeons and Dragons team wouldn't let me join. This is who I was  but this is who I wanted to be  Angelina Jolie. She portrayed Acid Burn in the '   film  Hackers.  She was pretty and she could rollerblade  but being a hacker  that made her powerful. And I wanted to be just like her  so I started spending a lot of time on hacker chat rooms and online forums. I remember one late night I found a bit of PHP code. I didn't really know what it did  but I copy pasted it and used it anyway to get into a password protected site like that. Open Sesame. It was a simple trick  and I was just a script kiddie back then  but to me  that trick  it felt like this  like I had discovered limitless potential at my fingertips. This is the rush of power that hackers feel. It's geeks just like me discovering they have access to superpower  one that requires the skill and tenacity of their intellect  but thankfully no radioactive spiders. But with great power comes great responsibility  and you all like to think that if we had such powers  we would only use them for good. But what if you could read your ex's emails  or add a couple zeros to your bank account. What would you do then  Indeed  many hackers do not resist those temptations  and so they are responsible in one way or another to billions of dollars lost each year to fraud  malware or plain old identity theft  which is a serious issue. But there are other hackers  hackers who just like to break things  and it is precisely those hackers that can find the weaker elements in our world and make us fix it. This is what happened last year when another security researcher called Kyle Lovett discovered a gaping hole in the design of certain wireless routers like you might have in your home or office. He learned that anyone could remotely connect to these devices over the Internet and download documents from hard drives attached to those routers  no password needed. He reported it to the company  of course  but they ignored his report. Perhaps they thought universal access was a feature  not a bug  until two months ago when a group of hackers used it to get into people's files. But they didn't steal anything. They left a note  Your router and your documents can be accessed by anyone in the world. Here's what you should do to fix it. We hope we helped. By getting into people's files like that  yeah  they broke the law  but they also forced that company to fix their product. Making vulnerabilities known to the public is a practice called full disclosure in the hacker community  and it is controversial  but it does make me think of how hackers have an evolving effect on technologies we use every day. This is what Khalil did. Khalil is a Palestinian hacker from the West Bank  and he found a serious privacy flaw on Facebook which he attempted to report through the company's bug bounty program. These are usually great arrangements for companies to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities they find in their code. Unfortunately  due to some miscommunications  his report was not acknowledged. Frustrated with the exchange  he took to use his own discovery to post on Mark Zuckerberg's wall. This got their attention  all right  and they fixed the bug  but because he hadn't reported it properly  he was denied the bounty usually paid out for such discoveries. Thankfully for Khalil  a group of hackers were watching out for him. In fact  they raised more than        dollars to reward him for this discovery  raising a vital discussion in the technology industry about how we come up with incentives for hackers to do the right thing. But I think there's a greater story here still. Even companies founded by hackers  like Facebook was  still have a complicated relationship when it comes to hackers. And so for more conservative organizations  it is going to take time and adapting in order to embrace hacker culture and the creative chaos that it brings with it. But I think it's worth the effort  because the alternative  to blindly fight all hackers  is to go against the power you cannot control at the cost of stifling innovation and regulating knowledge. These are things that will come back and bite you. It is even more true if we go after hackers that are willing to risk their own freedom for ideals like the freedom of the web  especially in times like this  like today even  as governments and corporates fight to control the Internet. I find it astounding that someone from the shadowy corners of cyberspace can become its voice of opposition  its last line of defense even  perhaps someone like Anonymous  the leading brand of global hacktivism. This universal hacker movement needs no introduction today  but six years ago they were not much more than an Internet subculture dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats and Internet trolling campaigns. Their moment of transformation was in early      when the Church of Scientology attempted to remove certain leaked videos from appearing on certain websites. This is when Anonymous was forged out of the seemingly random collection of Internet dwellers. It turns out  the Internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it  and it will react with cyberattacks and elaborate pranks and with a series of organized protests all around the world  from my hometown of Tel Aviv to Adelaide  Australia. This proved that Anonymous and this idea can rally the masses from the keyboards to the streets  and it laid the foundations for dozens of future operations against perceived injustices to their online and offline world. Since then  they've gone after many targets. They've uncovered corruption  abuse. They've hacked popes and politicians  and I think their effect is larger than simple denial of service attacks that take down websites or even leak sensitive documents. I think that  like Robin Hood  they are in the business of redistribution  but what they are after isn't your money. It's not your documents. It's your attention. They grab the spotlight for causes they support  forcing us to take note  acting as a global magnifying glass for issues that we are not as aware of but perhaps we should be. They have been called many names from criminals to terrorists  and I cannot justify their illegal means  but the ideas they fight for are ones that matter to us all. The reality is  hackers can do a lot more than break things. They can bring people together. And if the Internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it  just watch what happens when you try to shut the Internet down. This took place in Egypt in January       and as President Hosni Mubarak attempted a desperate move to quash the rising revolution on the streets of Cairo  he sent his personal troops down to Egypt's Internet service providers and had them physically kill the switch on the country's connection to the world overnight. For a government to do a thing like that was unprecedented  and for hackers  it made it personal. Hackers like the Telecomix group were already active on the ground  helping Egyptians bypass censorship using clever workarounds like Morse code and ham radio. It was high season for low tech  which the government couldn't block  but when the Net went completely down  Telecomix brought in the big guns. They found European service providers that still had    year old analog dial up access infrastructure. They opened up     of those lines for Egyptians to use  serving slow but sweet Internet connection for Egyptians. This worked. It worked so well  in fact  one guy even used it to download an episode of  How I Met Your Mother.  But while Egypt's future is still uncertain  when the same thing happened in Syria just one year later  Telecomix were prepared with those Internet lines  and Anonymous  they were perhaps the first international group to officially denounce the actions of the Syrian military by defacing their website. But with this sort of power  it really depends on where you stand  because one man's hero can be another's villain  and so the Syrian Electronic Army is a pro Assad group of hackers who support his contentious regime. They've taken down multiple high profile targets in the past few years  including the Associated Press's Twitter account  in which they posted a message about an attack on the White House injuring President Obama. This tweet was fake  of course  but the resulting drop in the Dow Jones index that day was most certainly not  and a lot of people lost a lot of money. This sort of thing is happening all over the world right now. In conflicts from the Crimean Peninsula to Latin America  from Europe to the United States  hackers are a force for social  political and military influence. As individuals or in groups  volunteers or military conflicts  there are hackers everywhere. They come from all walks of life  ethnicities  ideologies and genders  I might add. They are now shaping the world's stage. Hackers represent an exceptional force for change in the   st century. This is because access to information is a critical currency of power  one which governments would like to control  a thing they attempt to do by setting up all you can eat surveillance programs  a thing they need hackers for  by the way. And so the establishment has long had a love hate relationship when it comes to hackers  because the same people who demonize hacking also utilize it at large. Two years ago  I saw General Keith Alexander. He's the NSA director and U.S. cyber commander  but instead of his four star general uniform  he was wearing jeans and a t shirt. This was at DEF CON  the world's largest hacker conference. Perhaps like me  General Alexander didn't see        criminals that day in Vegas. I think he saw untapped potential. In fact  he was there to give a hiring pitch.  In this room right here   he said   is the talent our nation needs.  Well  hackers in the back row replied   Then stop arresting us.  Indeed  for years  hackers have been on the wrong side of the fence  but in light of what we know now  who is more watchful of our online world  The rules of the game are not that clear anymore  but hackers are perhaps the only ones still capable of challenging overreaching governments and data hoarding corporates on their own playing field. To me  that represents hope. For the past three decades  hackers have done a lot of things  but they have also impacted civil liberties  innovation and Internet freedom  so I think it's time we take a good look at how we choose to portray them  because if we keep expecting them to be the bad guys  how can they be the heroes too  My years in the hacker world have made me realize both the problem and the beauty about hackers  They just can't see something broken in the world and leave it be. They are compelled to either exploit it or try and change it  and so they find the vulnerable aspects in our rapidly changing world. They make us  they force us to fix things or demand something better  and I think we need them to do just that  because after all  it is not information that wants to be free  it's us. Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  Hack the planet  It was less than a year after September     and I was at the Chicago Tribune writing about shootings and murders  and it was leaving me feeling pretty dark and depressed. I had done some activism in college  so I decided to help a local group hang door knockers against animal testing. I thought it would be a safe way to do something positive  but of course I have the absolute worst luck ever  and we were all arrested. Police took this blurry photo of me holding leaflets as evidence. My charges were dismissed  but a few weeks later  two FBI agents knocked on my door  and they told me that unless I helped them by spying on protest groups  they would put me on a domestic terrorist list. I'd love to tell you that I didn't flinch  but I was terrified  and when my fear subsided  I became obsessed with finding out how this happened  how animal rights and environmental activists who have never injured anyone could become the FBI's number one domestic terrorism threat. A few years later  I was invited to testify before Congress about my reporting  and I told lawmakers that  while everybody is talking about going green  some people are risking their lives to defend forests and to stop oil pipelines. They're physically putting their bodies on the line between the whalers' harpoons and the whales. These are everyday people  like these protesters in Italy who spontaneously climbed over barbed wire fences to rescue beagles from animal testing. And these movements have been incredibly effective and popular  so in       their opponents made up a new word  eco terrorist  to shift how we view them. They just made it up. Now these companies have backed new laws like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act  which turns activism into terrorism if it causes a loss of profits. Now most people never even heard about this law  including members of Congress. Less than one percent were in the room when it passed the House. The rest were outside at a new memorial. They were praising Dr. King as his style of activism was branded as terrorism if done in the name of animals or the environment. Supporters say laws like this are needed for the extremists  the vandals  the arsonists  the radicals. But right now  companies like TransCanada are briefing police in presentations like this one about how to prosecute nonviolent protesters as terrorists. The FBI's training documents on eco terrorism are not about violence  they're about public relations. Today  in multiple countries  corporations are pushing new laws that make it illegal to photograph animal cruelty on their farms. The latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago  and today we released a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional as a threat to journalism. The first of these ag gag prosecutions  as they're called  was a young woman named Amy Meyer  and Amy saw a sick cow being moved by a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse as she was on the public street. And Amy did what any of us would  She filmed it. When I found out about her story  I wrote about it  and within    hours  it created such an uproar that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges. But apparently  even exposing stuff like that is a threat. Through the Freedom of Information Act  I learned that the counter terrorism unit has been monitoring my articles and speeches like this one. They even included this nice little write up of my book. They described it as  compelling and well written.  Blurb on the next book  right  The point of all of this is to make us afraid  but as a journalist  I have an unwavering faith in the power of education. Our best weapon is sunlight. Dostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man is to prove he's a man and not a piano key. Over and over throughout history  people in power have used fear to silence the truth and to silence dissent. It's time we strike a new note. Thank you. In the middle of my Ph.D.  I was hopelessly stuck. Every research direction that I tried led to a dead end. It seemed like my basic assumptions just stopped working. I felt like a pilot flying through the mist  and I lost all sense of direction. I stopped shaving. I couldn't get out of bed in the morning. I felt unworthy of stepping across the gates of the university  because I wasn't like Einstein or Newton or any other scientist whose results I had learned about  because in science  we just learn about the results  not the process. And so obviously  I couldn't be a scientist. But I had enough support and I made it through and discovered something new about nature. This is an amazing feeling of calmness  being the only person in the world who knows a new law of nature. And I started the second project in my Ph.D  and it happened again. I got stuck and I made it through. And I started thinking  maybe there's a pattern here. I asked the other graduate students  and they said   Yeah  that's exactly what happened to us  except nobody told us about it.  We'd all studied science as if it's a series of logical steps between question and answer  but doing research is nothing like that. At the same time  I was also studying to be an improvisation theater actor. So physics by day  and by night  laughing  jumping  singing  playing my guitar. Improvisation theater  just like science  goes into the unknown  because you have to make a scene onstage without a director  without a script  without having any idea what you'll portray or what the other characters will do. But unlike science  in improvisation theater  they tell you from day one what's going to happen to you when you get onstage. You're going to fail miserably. You're going to get stuck. And we would practice staying creative inside that stuck place. For example  we had an exercise where we all stood in a circle  and each person had to do the world's worst tap dance  and everybody else applauded and cheered you on  supporting you onstage. When I became a professor and had to guide my own students through their research projects  I realized again  I don't know what to do. I'd studied thousands of hours of physics  biology  chemistry  but not one hour  not one concept on how to mentor  how to guide someone to go together into the unknown  about motivation. So I turned to improvisation theater  and I told my students from day one what's going to happen when you start research  and this has to do with our mental schema of what research will be like. Because you see  whenever people do anything  for example if I want to touch this blackboard  my brain first builds up a schema  a prediction of exactly what my muscles will do before I even start moving my hand  and if I get blocked  if my schema doesn't match reality  that causes extra stress called cognitive dissonance. That's why your schemas had better match reality. But if you believe the way science is taught  and if you believe textbooks  you're liable to have the following schema of research. If A is the question  and B is the answer  then research is a direct path. The problem is that if an experiment doesn't work  or a student gets depressed  it's perceived as something utterly wrong and causes tremendous stress. And that's why I teach my students a more realistic schema. Here's an example where things don't match your schema. So I teach my students a different schema. If A is the question  B is the answer  stay creative in the cloud  and you start going  and experiments don't work  experiments don't work  experiments don't work  experiments don't work  until you reach a place linked with negative emotions where it seems like your basic assumptions have stopped making sense  like somebody yanked the carpet beneath your feet. And I call this place the cloud. Now you can be lost in the cloud for a day  a week  a month  a year  a whole career  but sometimes  if you're lucky enough and you have enough support  you can see in the materials at hand  or perhaps meditating on the shape of the cloud  a new answer  C  and you decide to go for it. And experiments don't work  experiments don't work  but you get there  and then you tell everyone about it by publishing a paper that reads A arrow C  which is a great way to communicate  but as long as you don't forget the path that brought you there. Now this cloud is an inherent part of research  an inherent part of our craft  because the cloud stands guard at the boundary. It stands guard at the boundary between the known and the unknown  because in order to discover something truly new  at least one of your basic assumptions has to change  and that means that in science  we do something quite heroic. Every day  we try to bring ourselves to the boundary between the known and the unknown and face the cloud. Now notice that I put B in the land of the known  because we knew about it in the beginning  but C is always more interesting and more important than B. So B is essential in order to get going  but C is much more profound  and that's the amazing thing about resesarch. Now just knowing that word  the cloud  has been transformational in my research group  because students come to me and say   Uri  I'm in the cloud   and I say   Great  you must be feeling miserable.  But I'm kind of happy  because we might be close to the boundary between the known and the unknown  and we stand a chance of discovering something truly new  since the way our mind works  it's just knowing that the cloud is normal  it's essential  and in fact beautiful  we can join the Cloud Appreciation Society  and it detoxifies the feeling that something is deeply wrong with me. And as a mentor  I know what to do  which is to step up my support for the student  because research in psychology shows that if you're feeling fear and despair  your mind narrows down to very safe and conservative ways of thinking. If you'd like to explore the risky paths needed to get out of the cloud  you need other emotions    solidarity  support  hope   that come with your connection from somebody else  so like in improvisation theater  in science  it's best to walk into the unknown together. So knowing about the cloud  you also learn from improvisation theater a very effective way to have conversations inside the cloud. It's based on the central principle of improvisation theater  so here improvisation theater came to my help again. It's called saying  Yes  and  to the offers made by other actors. That means accepting the offers and building on them  saying   Yes  and.  For example  if one actor says   Here is a pool of water   and the other actor says   No  that's just a stage   the improvisation is over. It's dead  and everybody feels frustrated. That's called blocking. If you're not mindful of communications  scientific conversations can have a lot of blocking. Saying  Yes  and  sounds like this.  Here is a pool of water.   Yeah  let's jump in.   Look  there's a whale  Let's grab it by its tail. It's pulling us to the moon   So saying  Yes  and  bypasses our inner critic. We all have an inner critic that kind of guards what we say  so people don't think that we're obscene or crazy or unoriginal  and science is full of the fear of appearing unoriginal. Saying  Yes  and  bypasses the critic and unlocks hidden voices of creativity you didn't even know that you had  and they often carry the answer about the cloud. So you see  knowing about the cloud and about saying  Yes  and  made my lab very creative. Students started playing off of each others' ideas  and we made surprising discoveries in the interface between physics and biology. For example  we were stuck for a year trying to understand the intricate biochemical networks inside our cells  and we said   We are deeply in the cloud   and we had a playful conversation where my student Shai Shen Orr said   Let's just draw this on a piece of paper  this network   and instead of saying   But we've done that so many times and it doesn't work   I said   Yes  and let's use a very big piece of paper   and then Ron Milo said   Let's use a gigantic architect's blueprint kind of paper  and I know where to print it   and we printed out the network and looked at it  and that's where we made our most important discovery  that this complicated network is just made of a handful of simple  repeating interaction patterns like motifs in a stained glass window. We call them network motifs  and they're the elementary circuits that help us understand the logic of the way cells make decisions in all organisms  including our body. Soon enough  after this  I started being invited to give talks to thousands of scientists across the world  but the knowledge about the cloud and saying  Yes  and  just stayed within my own lab  because you see  in science  we don't talk about the process  anything subjective or emotional. We talk about the results. So there was no way to talk about it in conferences. That was unthinkable. And I saw scientists in other groups get stuck without even having a word to describe what they're seeing  and their ways of thinking narrowed down to very safe paths  their science didn't reach its full potential  and they were miserable. I thought  that's the way it is. I'll try to make my lab as creative as possible  and if everybody else does the same  science will eventually become more and more better and better. That way of thinking got turned on its head when by chance I went to hear Evelyn Fox Keller give a talk about her experiences as a woman in science. And she asked   Why is it that we don't talk about the subjective and emotional aspects of doing science  It's not by chance. It's a matter of values.  You see  science seeks knowledge that's objective and rational. That's the beautiful thing about science. But we also have a cultural myth that the doing of science  what we do every day to get that knowledge  is also only objective and rational  like Mr. Spock. And when you label something as objective and rational  automatically  the other side  the subjective and emotional  become labeled as non science or anti science or threatening to science  and we just don't talk about it. And when I heard that  that science has a culture  everything clicked into place for me  because if science has a culture  culture can be changed  and I can be a change agent working to change the culture of science wherever I could. And so the very next lecture I gave in a conference  I talked about my science  and then I talked about the importance of the subjective and emotional aspects of doing science and how we should talk about them  and I looked at the audience  and they were cold. They couldn't hear what I was saying in the context of a    back to back PowerPoint presentation conference. And I tried again and again  conference after conference  but I wasn't getting through. I was in the cloud. And eventually I managed to get out the cloud using improvisation and music. Since then  every conference I go to  I give a science talk and a second  special talk called  Love and fear in the lab   and I start it off by doing a song about scientists' greatest fear  which is that we work hard  we discover something new  and somebody else publishes it before we do. We call it being scooped  and being scooped feels horrible. It makes us afraid to talk to each other  which is no fun  because we came to science to share our ideas and to learn from each other  and so I do a blues song  which    Applause    called  Scooped Again   and I ask the audience to be my backup singers  and I tell them   Your text is 'Scoop  Scoop.'  It sounds like this   Scoop  scoop   Sounds like this.   I've been scooped again     Scoop  Scoop    And then we go for it.   I've been scooped again     Scoop  Scoop      I've been scooped again     Scoop  Scoop      I've been scooped again     Scoop  Scoop      I've been scooped again     Scoop  Scoop      Oh mama  can't you feel my pain     Heavens help me  I've been scooped again   Thank you. Thank you for your backup singing. So everybody starts laughing  starts breathing  notices that there's other scientists around them with shared issues  and we start talking about the emotional and subjective things that go on in research. It feels like a huge taboo has been lifted. Finally  we can talk about this in a scientific conference. And scientists have gone on to form peer groups where they meet regularly and create a space to talk about the emotional and subjective things that happen as they're mentoring  as they're going into the unknown  and even started courses about the process of doing science  about going into the unknown together  and many other things. So my vision is that  just like every scientist knows the word  atom   that matter is made out of atoms  every scientist would know the words like  the cloud   saying  Yes  and   and science will become much more creative  make many  many more unexpected discoveries for the benefit of us all  and would also be much more playful. And what I might ask you to remember from this talk is that next time you face a problem you can't solve in work or in life  there's a word for what you're going to see  the cloud. And you can go through the cloud not alone but together with someone who is your source of support to say  Yes  and  to your ideas  to help you say  Yes  and  to your own ideas  to increase the chance that  through the wisps of the cloud  you'll find that moment of calmness where you get your first glimpse of your unexpected discovery  your C. Thank you. Six months ago  I got an email from a man in Israel who had read one of my books  and the email said   You don't know me  but I'm your   th cousin.  And it said   I have a family tree with        people on it  including you  Karl Marx  and several European aristocrats.  Now I did not know what to make of this. Part of me was like  okay  when's he going to ask me to wire        dollars to his Nigerian bank  right  I also thought         relatives  do I want that  I have enough trouble with some of the ones I have already. And I won't name names  but you know who you are. But another part of me said  this is remarkable. Here I am alone in my office  but I'm not alone at all. I'm connected to        people around the world  and that's four Madison Square Gardens full of cousins. And some of them are going to be great  and some of them are going to be irritating  but they're all related to me. So this email inspired me to dive into genealogy  which I always thought was a very staid and proper field  but it turns out it's going through a fascinating revolution  and a controversial one. Partly  this is because of DNA and genetic testing  but partly  it's because of the Internet. There are sites that now take the Wikipedia approach to family trees  collaboration and crowdsourcing  and what you do is  you load your family tree on  and then these sites search to see if the A.J. Jacobs in your tree is the same as the A.J. Jacobs in another tree  and if it is  then you can combine  and then you combine and combine and combine until you get these massive  mega family trees with thousands of people on them  or even millions. I'm on something on Geni called the world family tree  which has no less than a jaw dropping    million people. So that's    million people connected by blood or marriage  sometimes both. It's in all seven continents  including Antarctica. I'm on it. Many of you are on it  whether you know it or not  and you can see the links. Here's my cousin Gwyneth Paltrow. She has no idea I exist  but we are officially cousins. We have just    links between us. And there's my cousin Barack Obama. And he is my aunt's fifth great aunt's husband's father's wife's seventh great nephew  so practically my old brother. And my cousin  of course  the actor Kevin Bacon    who is my first cousin's twice removed's wife's niece's husband's first cousin once removed's niece's husband. So six degrees of Kevin Bacon  plus or minus several degrees. Now  I'm not boasting  because all of you have famous people and historical figures in your tree  because we are all connected  and    million may seem like a lot  but in a few years  it's quite likely we will have a family tree with all  almost all  seven billion people on Earth. But does it really matter  What's the importance  And I do think it is important  and I'll give you five reasons why  really quickly. First  it's got scientific value. This is an unprecedented history of the human race  and it's giving us valuable data about how diseases are inherited  how people migrate  and there's a team of scientists at MIT right now studying the world family tree. Number two  it brings history alive. I found out I'm connected to Albert Einstein  so I told my seven year old son that  and he was totally engaged. Now Albert Einstein is not some dead white guy with weird hair. He's Uncle Albert.  Laughter  And my son wanted to know   What did he say  What is E   MC squared   Also  it's not all good news. I found a link to Jeffrey Dahmer  the serial killer  but I will say that's on my wife's side. So I want to make that clear. Sorry  honey. Number three  interconnectedness. We all come from the same ancestor  and you don't have to believe the literal Bible version  but scientists talk about Y chromosomal Adam and mitochondrial Eve  and these were about         to         years ago. We all have a bit of their DNA in us. They are our great great great great great great    continue that for about       times    grandparents  and so that means we literally all are biological cousins as well  and estimates vary  but probably the farthest cousin you have on Earth is about a   th cousin. Now  it's not just ancestors we share  descendants. If you have kids  and they have kids  look how quickly the descendants accumulate. So in        generations  you're going to have thousands of offspring  and millions of offspring. Number four  a kinder world. Now  I know that there are family feuds. I have three sons  so I see how they fight. But I think that there's also a human bias to treat your family a little better than strangers. I think this tree is going to be bad news for bigots  because they're going to have to realize that they are cousins with thousands of people in whatever ethnic group they happen to have issues with  and I think you look back at history  and a lot of the terrible things we've done to each other is because one group thinks another group is sub human  and you can't do that anymore. We're not just part of the same species. We're part of the same family. We share   .  percent of our DNA. Now the final one is number five  a democratizing effect. Some genealogy has an elitist strain  like people say   Oh  I'm descended from Mary Queen of Scots and you're not  so you cannot join my country club.  But that's really going to be hard to do now  because everyone is related. I'm descended from Mary Queen of Scots    by marriage  but still. So it's really a fascinating time in the history of family  because it's changing so fast. There is gay marriage and sperm donors and there's intermarriage on an unprecedented scale  and this makes some of my more conservative cousins a little nervous  but I actually think it's a good thing. I think the more inclusive the idea of family is  the better  because then you have more potential caretakers  and as my aunt's eighth cousin twice removed Hillary Clinton says    it takes a village. So I have all these hundreds and thousands  millions of new cousins. I thought  what can I do with this information  And that's when I decided  why not throw a party  So that's what I'm doing. And you're all invited. Next year  next summer  I will be hosting what I hope is the biggest and best family reunion in history. Thank you. I want you there. I want you there. It's going to be at the New York Hall of Science  which is a great venue  but it's also on the site of the former World's Fair  which is  I think  very appropriate  because I see this as a family reunion meets a world's fair. There's going to be exhibits and food  music. Paul McCartney is    steps away  so I'm hoping he brings his guitar. He hasn't RSVP'd yet  but fingers crossed. And there is going to be a day of speakers  of fascinating cousins. It's early  but I've already  I've got some lined up. Cass Sunstein  my cousin who is perhaps the most brilliant legal scholar  will be talking. He was a former member of the Obama administration. And on the other side of the political spectrum  George H.W. Bush  number     the father  he has agreed to participate  and Nick Kroll  the comedian  and Dr. Oz  and many more to come. And  of course  the most important is that you  I want you guys there  and I invite you to go to GlobalFamilyReunion.org and figure out how you're on the family tree  because these are big issues  family and tribe  and I don't know all the answers  but I have a lot of smart relatives  including you guys  so together  I think we can figure it out. Only together can we solve these big problems. So from cousin to cousin  I thank you. I can't wait to see you. Goodbye. People say things about religion all the time. The late  great Christopher Hitchens wrote a book called  God Is Not Great  whose subtitle was   Religion Poisons Everything.  But last month  in Time magazine  Rabbi David Wolpe  who I gather is referred to as America's rabbi  said  to balance that against that negative characterization  that no important form of social change can be brought about except through organized religion. Now  remarks of this sort on the negative and the positive side are very old. I have one in my pocket here from the first century BCE by Lucretius  the author of  On the Nature of Things   who said   Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum     I should have been able to learn that by heart   which is  that's how much religion is able to persuade people to do evil  and he was talking about the fact of Agamemnon's decision to place his daughter Iphigenia on an altar of sacrifice in order to preserve the prospects of his army. So there have been these long debates over the centuries  in that case  actually  we can say over the millennia  about religion. People have talked about it a lot  and they've said good and bad and indifferent things about it. What I want to persuade you of today is of a very simple claim  which is that these debates are in a certain sense preposterous  because there is no such thing as religion about which to make these claims. There isn't a thing called religion  and so it can't be good or bad. It can't even be indifferent. And if you think about claims about the nonexistence of things  one obvious way to try and establish the nonexistence of a purported thing would be to offer a definition of that thing and then to see whether anything satisfied it. I'm going to start out on that little route to begin with. So if you look in the dictionaries and if you think about it  one very natural definition of religion is that it involves belief in gods or in spiritual beings. As I say  this is in many dictionaries  but you'll also find it actually in the work of Sir Edward Tylor  who was the first professor of anthropology at Oxford  one of the first modern anthropologists. In his book on primitive culture  he says the heart of religion is what he called animism  that is  the belief in spiritual agency  belief in spirits. The first problem for that definition is from a recent novel by Paul Beatty called  Tuff.  There's a guy talking to a rabbi. The rabbi says he doesn't believe in God. The guy says   You're a rabbi  how can you not believe in God   And the reply is   It's what's so great about being Jewish. You don't have to believe in a God per se  just in being Jewish.   Laughter  So if this guy is a rabbi  and a Jewish rabbi  and if you have to believe in God in order to be religious  then we have the rather counterintuitive conclusion that since it's possible to be a Jewish rabbi without believing in God  Judaism isn't a religion. That seems like a pretty counterintuitive thought. Here's another argument against this view. A friend of mine  an Indian friend of mine  went to his grandfather when he was very young  a child  and said to him   I want to talk to you about religion   and his grandfather said   You're too young. Come back when you're a teenager.  So he came back when he was a teenager  and he said to his grandfather   It may be a bit late now because I've discovered that I don't believe in the gods.  And his grandfather  who was a wise man  said   Oh  so you belong to the atheist branch of the Hindu tradition.   Laughter  And finally  there's this guy  who famously doesn't believe in God. His name is the Dalai Lama. He often jokes that he's one of the world's leading atheists. But it's true  because the Dalai Lama's religion does not involve belief in God. Now you might think this just shows that I've given you the wrong definition and that I should come up with some other definition and test it against these cases and try and find something that captures atheistic Judaism  atheistic Hinduism  and atheistic Buddhism as forms of religiosity  but I actually think that that's a bad idea  and the reason I think it's a bad idea is that I don't think that's how our concept of religion works. I think the way our concept of religion works is that we actually have  we have a list of paradigm religions and their sub parts  right  and if something new comes along that purports to be a religion  what we ask is   Well  is it like one of these   Right  And I think that's not only how we think about religion  and that's  as it were  so from our point of view  anything on that list had better be a religion  which is why I don't think an account of religion that excludes Buddhism and Judaism has a chance of being a good starter  because they're on our list. But why do we have such a list  What's going on  How did it come about that we have this list  I think the answer is a pretty simple one and therefore crude and contentious. I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with it  but here's my story  and true or not  it's a story that I think gives you a good sense of how the list might have come about  and therefore helps you to think about what use the list might be. I think the answer is  European travelers  starting roughly about the time of Columbus  started going around the world. They came from a Christian culture  and when they arrived in a new place  they noticed that some people didn't have Christianity  and so they asked themselves the following question  what have they got instead of Christianity  And that list was essentially constructed. It consists of the things that other people had instead of Christianity. Now there's a difficulty with proceeding in that way  which is that Christianity is extremely  even on that list  it's an extremely specific tradition. It has all kinds of things in it that are very  very particular that are the results of the specifics of Christian history  and one thing that's at the heart of it  one thing that's at the heart of most understandings of Christianity  which is the result of the specific history of Christianity  is that it's an extremely creedal religion. It's a religion in which people are really concerned about whether you believe the right things. The history of Christianity  the internal history of Christianity  is largely the history of people killing each other because they believed the wrong thing  and it's also involved in struggles with other religions  obviously starting in the Middle Ages  a struggle with Islam  in which  again  it was the infidelity  the fact that they didn't believe the right things  that seemed so offensive to the Christian world. Now that's a very specific and particular history that Christianity has  and not everywhere is everything that has ever been put on this sort of list like it. Here's another problem  I think. A very specific thing happened. It was actually adverted to earlier  but a very specific thing happened in the history of the kind of Christianity that we see around us mostly in the United States today  and it happened in the late   th century  and that specific thing that happened in the late   th century was a kind of deal that was cut between science  this new way of organizing intellectual authority  and religion. If you think about the   th century  say  if you think about intellectual life before the late   th century  anything you did  anything you thought about  whether it was the physical world  the human world  the natural world apart from the human world  or morality  anything you did would have been framed against the background of a set of assumptions that were religious  Christian assumptions. You couldn't give an account of the natural world that didn't say something about its relationship  for example  to the creation story in the Abrahamic tradition  the creation story in the first book of the Torah. So everything was framed in that way. But this changes in the late   th century  and for the first time  it's possible for people to develop serious intellectual careers as natural historians like Darwin. Darwin worried about the relationship between what he said and the truths of religion  but he could proceed  he could write books about his subject without having to say what the relationship was to the religious claims  and similarly  geologists increasingly could talk about it. In the early   th century  if you were a geologist and made a claim about the age of the Earth  you had to explain whether that was consistent or how it was or wasn't consistent with the age of the Earth implied by the account in Genesis. By the end of the   th century  you can just write a geology textbook in which you make arguments about how old the Earth is. So there's a big change  and that division  that intellectual division of labor occurs as I say  I think  and it sort of solidifies so that by the end of the   th century in Europe  there's a real intellectual division of labor  and you can do all sorts of serious things  including  increasingly  even philosophy  without being constrained by the thought   Well  what I have to say has to be consistent with the deep truths that are given to me by our religious tradition.  So imagine someone who's coming out of that world  that late   th century world  coming into the country that I grew up in  Ghana  the society that I grew up in  Asante  coming into that world at the turn of the   th century with this question that made the list  what have they got instead of Christianity  Well  here's one thing he would have noticed  and by the way  there was a  person who actually did this. His name was Captain Rattray  he was sent as the British government anthropologist  and he wrote a book about Asante religion. This is a soul disc. There are many of them in the British Museum. I could give you an interesting  different history of how it comes about that many of the things from my society ended up in the British Museum  but we don't have time for that. So this object is a soul disc. What is a soul disc  It was worn around the necks of the soul washers of the Asante king. What was their job  To wash the king's soul. It would take a long while to explain how a soul could be the kind of thing that could be washed  but Rattray knew that this was religion because souls were in play. And similarly  there were many other things  many other practices. For example  every time anybody had a drink  more or less  they poured a little bit on the ground in what's called the libation  and they gave some to the ancestors. My father did this. Every time he opened a bottle of whiskey  which I'm glad to say was very often  he would take the top off and pour off just a little on the ground  and he would talk to  he would say to Akroma Ampim  the founder of our line  or Yao Antony  my great uncle  he would talk to them  offer them a little bit of this. And finally  there were these huge public ceremonials. This is an early   th century drawing by another British military officer of such a ceremonial  where the king was involved  and the king's job  one of the large parts of his job  apart from organizing warfare and things like that  was to look after the tombs of his ancestors  and when a king died  the stool that he sat on was blackened and put in the royal ancestral temple  and every    days  the King of Asante has to go and do cult for his ancestors. That's a large part of his job  and people think that if he doesn't do it  things will fall apart. So he's a religious figure  as Rattray would have said  as well as a political figure. So all this would count as religion for Rattray  but my point is that when you look into the lives of those people  you also find that every time they do anything  they're conscious of the ancestors. Every morning at breakfast  you can go outside the front of the house and make an offering to the god tree  the nyame dua outside your house  and again  you'll talk to the gods and the high gods and the low gods and the ancestors and so on. This is not a world in which the separation between religion and science has occurred. Religion has not being separated from any other areas of life  and in particular  what's crucial to understand about this world is that it's a world in which the job that science does for us is done by what Rattray is going to call religion  because if they want an explanation of something  if they want to know why the crop just failed  if they want to know why it's raining or not raining  if they need rain  if they want to know why their grandfather has died  they are going to appeal to the very same entities  the very same language  talk to the very same gods about that. This great separation  in other words  between religion and science hasn't happened. Now  this would be a mere historical curiosity  except that in large parts of the world  this is still the truth. I had the privilege of going to a wedding the other day in northern Namibia     miles or so south of the Angolan border in a village of     people. These were modern people. We had with us Oona Chaplin  who some of you may have heard of  and one of the people from this village came up to her  and said   I've seen you in 'Game of Thrones.'  So these were not people who were isolated from our world  but nevertheless  for them  the gods and the spirits are still very much there  and when we were on the bus going back and forth to the various parts of the  ceremony   they prayed not just in a generic way but for the safety of the journey  and they meant it  and when they said to me that my mother  the bridegroom's  grandmother   was with us  they didn't mean it figuratively. They meant  even though she was a dead person  they meant that she was still around. So in large parts of the world today  that separation between science and religion hasn't occurred in large parts of the world today  and as I say  these are not    This guy used to work for Chase and at the World Bank. These are fellow citizens of the world with you  but they come from a place in which religion is occupying a very different role. So what I want you to think about next time somebody wants to make some vast generalization about religion is that maybe there isn't such a thing as a religion  such a thing as religion  and that therefore what they say cannot possibly be true. I need to start by telling you a little bit about my social life  which I know may not seem relevant  but it is. When people meet me at parties and they find out that I'm an English professor who specializes in language  they generally have one of two reactions. One set of people look frightened.  Laughter  They often say something like   Oh  I'd better be careful what I say. I'm sure you'll hear every mistake I make.  And then they stop talking.  Laughter  And they wait for me to go away and talk to someone else. The other set of people  their eyes light up  and they say   You are just the person I want to talk to.  And then they tell me about whatever it is they think is going wrong with the English language. A couple of weeks ago  I was at a dinner party and the man to my right started telling me about all the ways that the Internet is degrading the English language. He brought up Facebook  and he said   To defriend  I mean  is that even a real word   I want to pause on that question  What makes a word real  My dinner companion and I both know what the verb  defriend  means  so when does a new word like  defriend  become real  Who has the authority to make those kinds of official decisions about words  anyway  Those are the questions I want to talk about today. I think most people  when they say a word isn't real  what they mean is  it doesn't appear in a standard dictionary. That  of course  raises a host of other questions  including  who writes dictionaries  Before I go any further  let me clarify my role in all of this. I do not write dictionaries. I do  however  collect new words much the way dictionary editors do  and the great thing about being a historian of the English language is that I get to call this  research.  When I teach the history of the English language  I require that students teach me two new slang words before I will begin class. Over the years  I have learned some great new slang this way  including  hangry   which    which is when you are cranky or angry because you are hungry  and  adorkable   which is when you are adorable in kind of a dorky way  clearly  terrific words that fill important gaps in the English language. But how real are they if we use them primarily as slang and they don't yet appear in a dictionary  With that  let's turn to dictionaries. I'm going to do this as a show of hands  How many of you still regularly refer to a dictionary  either print or online  Okay  so that looks like most of you. Now  a second question. Again  a show of hands  How many of you have ever looked to see who edited the dictionary you are using  Okay  many fewer. At some level  we know that there are human hands behind dictionaries  but we're really not sure who those hands belong to. I'm actually fascinated by this. Even the most critical people out there tend not to be very critical about dictionaries  not distinguishing among them and not asking a whole lot of questions about who edited them. Just think about the phrase  Look it up in the dictionary   which suggests that all dictionaries are exactly the same. Consider the library here on campus  where you go into the reading room  and there is a large  unabridged dictionary up on a pedestal in this place of honor and respect lying open so we can go stand before it to get answers. Now  don't get me wrong  dictionaries are fantastic resources  but they are human and they are not timeless. I'm struck as a teacher that we tell students to critically question every text they read  every website they visit  except dictionaries  which we tend to treat as un authored  as if they came from nowhere to give us answers about what words really mean. Here's the thing  If you ask dictionary editors  what they'll tell you is they're just trying to keep up with us as we change the language. They're watching what we say and what we write and trying to figure out what's going to stick and what's not going to stick. They have to gamble  because they want to appear cutting edge and catch the words that are going to make it  such as LOL  but they don't want to appear faddish and include the words that aren't going to make it  and I think a word that they're watching right now is YOLO  you only live once. Now I get to hang out with dictionary editors  and you might be surprised by one of the places where we hang out. Every January  we go to the American Dialect Society annual meeting  where among other things  we vote on the word of the year. There are about     or     people who come  some of the best known linguists in the United States. To give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting  it occurs right before happy hour. Anyone who comes can vote. The most important rule is that you can vote with only one hand. In the past  some of the winners have been  tweet  in      and  hashtag  in     .  Chad  was the word of the year in the year       because who knew what a chad was before       and  WMD  in     . Now  we have other categories in which we vote too  and my favorite category is most creative word of the year. Past winners in this category have included  recombobulation area   which is at the Milwaukee Airport after security  where you can recombobulate. You can put your belt back on  put your computer back in your bag. And then my all time favorite word at this vote  which is  multi slacking.  And multi slacking is the act of having multiple windows up on your screen so it looks like you're working when you're actually goofing around on the web. Will all of these words stick  Absolutely not. And we have made some questionable choices  for example in      when the word of the year was  Plutoed   to mean demoted. But some of the past winners now seem completely unremarkable  such as  app  and  e  as a prefix  and  google  as a verb. Now  a few weeks before our vote  Lake Superior State University issues its list of banished words for the year. What is striking about this is that there's actually often quite a lot of overlap between their list and the list that we are considering for words of the year  and this is because we're noticing the same thing. We're noticing words that are coming into prominence. It's really a question of attitude. Are you bothered by language fads and language change  or do you find it fun  interesting  something worthy of study as part of a living language  The list by Lake Superior State University continues a fairly long tradition in English of complaints about new words. So here is Dean Henry Alford in       who was very concerned that  desirability  is really a terrible word. In       Benjamin Franklin wrote a letter to David Hume giving up the word  colonize  as bad. Over the years  we've also seen worries about new pronunciations. Here is Samuel Rogers in      who is concerned about some fashionable pronunciations that he finds offensive  and he says  as if contemplate were not bad enough  balcony makes me sick.  The word is borrowed in from Italian and it was pronounced bal COE nee. These complaints now strike us as quaint  if not downright adorkable     Laughter     but here's the thing  we still get quite worked up about language change. I have an entire file in my office of newspaper articles which express concern about illegitimate words that should not have been included in the dictionary  including  LOL  when it got into the Oxford English Dictionary and  defriend  when it got into the Oxford American Dictionary. I also have articles expressing concern about  invite  as a noun   impact  as a verb  because only teeth can be impacted  and  incentivize  is described as  boorish  bureaucratic misspeak.  Now  it's not that dictionary editors ignore these kinds of attitudes about language. They try to provide us some guidance about words that are considered slang or informal or offensive  often through usage labels  but they're in something of a bind  because they're trying to describe what we do  and they know that we often go to dictionaries to get information about how we should use a word well or appropriately. In response  the American Heritage Dictionaries include usage notes. Usage notes tend to occur with words that are troublesome in one way  and one of the ways that they can be troublesome is that they're changing meaning. Now usage notes involve very human decisions  and I think  as dictionary users  we're often not as aware of those human decisions as we should be. To show you what I mean  we'll look at an example  but before we do  I want to explain what the dictionary editors are trying to deal with in this usage note. Think about the word  peruse  and how you use that word. I would guess many of you are thinking of skim  scan  reading quickly. Some of you may even have some walking involved  because you're perusing grocery store shelves  or something like that. You might be surprised to learn that if you look in most standard dictionaries  the first definition will be to read carefully  or pore over. American Heritage has that as the first definition. They then have  as the second definition  skim  and next to that  they say  usage problem.  And then they include a usage note  which is worth looking at. So here's the usage note   Peruse has long meant 'to read thoroughly'... But the word is often used more loosely  to mean simply 'to read.'... Further extension of the word to mean 'to glance over  skim ' has traditionally been considered an error  but our ballot results suggest that it is becoming somewhat more acceptable. When asked about the sentence  'I only had a moment to peruse the manual quickly '    percent of the  Usage  Panel found it unacceptable in          percent in       and    percent in     .  Ah  the Usage Panel  that trusted body of language authorities who is getting more lenient about this. Now  what I hope you're thinking right now is   Wait  who's on the Usage Panel  And what should I do with their pronouncements   If you look in the front matter of American Heritage Dictionaries  you can actually find the names of the people on the Usage Panel. But who looks at the front matter of dictionaries  There are about     people on the Usage Panel. They include academicians  journalists  creative writers. There's a Supreme Court justice on it and a few linguists. As of       the list includes me. Here's what we can do for you. We can give you a sense of the range of opinions about contested usage. That is and should be the extent of our authority. We are not a language academy. About once a year  I get a ballot that asks me about whether new uses  new pronunciations  new meanings  are acceptable. Now here's what I do to fill out the ballot. I listen to what other people are saying and writing. I do not listen to my own likes and dislikes about the English language. I will be honest with you  I do not like the word  impactful   but that is neither here nor there in terms of whether  impactful  is becoming common usage and becoming more acceptable in written prose. So to be responsible  what I do is go look at usage  which often involves going to look at online databases such as Google Books. Well  if you look for  impactful  in Google Books  here is what you find. Well  it sure looks like  impactful  is proving useful for a certain number of writers  and has become more and more useful over the last    years. Now  there are going to be changes that all of us don't like in the language. There are going to be changes where you think   Really  Does the language have to change that way   What I'm saying is  we should be less quick to decide that that change is terrible  we should be less quick to impose our likes and dislikes about words on other people  and we should be entirely reluctant to think that the English language is in trouble. It's not. It is rich and vibrant and filled with the creativity of the speakers who speak it. In retrospect  we think it's fascinating that the word  nice  used to mean silly  and that the word  decimate  used to mean to kill one in every   . We think that Ben Franklin was being silly to worry about  notice  as a verb. Well  you know what  We're going to look pretty silly in a hundred years for worrying about  impact  as a verb and  invite  as a noun. The language is not going to change so fast that we can't keep up. Language just doesn't work that way. I hope that what you can do is find language change not worrisome but fun and fascinating  just the way dictionary editors do. I hope you can enjoy being part of the creativity that is continually remaking our language and keeping it robust. So how does a word get into a dictionary  It gets in because we use it and we keep using it  and dictionary editors are paying attention to us. If you're thinking   But that lets all of us decide what words mean   I would say   Yes it does  and it always has.  Dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource  but there is no objective dictionary authority out there that is the final arbiter about what words mean. If a community of speakers is using a word and knows what it means  it's real. That word might be slangy  that word might be informal  that word might be a word that you think is illogical or unnecessary  but that word that we're using  that word is real. Thank you. Think of a hard choice you'll face in the near future. It might be between two careers    artist and accountant    or places to live    the city or the country    or even between two people to marry    you could marry Betty or you could marry Lolita. Or it might be a choice about whether to have children  to have an ailing parent move in with you  to raise your child in a religion that your partner lives by but leaves you cold. Or whether to donate your life savings to charity. Chances are  the hard choice you thought of was something big  something momentous  something that matters to you. Hard choices seem to be occasions for agonizing  hand wringing  the gnashing of teeth. But I think we've misunderstood hard choices and the role they play in our lives. Understanding hard choices uncovers a hidden power each of us possesses. What makes a choice hard is the way the alternatives relate. In any easy choice  one alternative is better than the other. In a hard choice  one alternative is better in some ways  the other alternative is better in other ways  and neither is better than the other overall. You agonize over whether to stay in your current job in the city or uproot your life for more challenging work in the country because staying is better in some ways  moving is better in others  and neither is better than the other overall. We shouldn't think that all hard choices are big. Let's say you're deciding what to have for breakfast. You could have high fiber bran cereal or a chocolate donut. Suppose what matters in the choice is tastiness and healthfulness. The cereal is better for you  the donut tastes way better  but neither is better than the other overall  a hard choice. Realizing that small choices can also be hard may make big hard choices seem less intractable. After all  we manage to figure  out what to have for breakfast  so maybe we can figure out whether to stay in the city or uproot for the new job in the country. We also shouldn't think that hard choices are hard because we are stupid. When I graduated from college  I couldn't decide between two careers  philosophy and law. I really loved philosophy. There are amazing things you can learn as a philosopher  and all from the comfort of an armchair. But I came from a modest immigrant family where my idea of luxury was having a pork tongue and jelly sandwich in my school lunchbox  so the thought of spending my whole life sitting around in armchairs just thinking  well  that struck me as the height  of extravagance and frivolity. So I got out my yellow pad  I drew a line down the middle  and I tried my best to think of the reasons for and against each alternative. I remember thinking to myself  if only I knew what my life in each career would be like. If only God or Netflix would send me a DVD of my two possible future careers  I'd be set. I'd compare them side by side  I'd see that one was better  and the choice would be easy. But I got no DVD  and because I couldn't figure out which was better  I did what many of us do in hard choices  I took the safest option. Fear of being an unemployed philosopher led me to become a lawyer  and as I discovered  lawyering didn't quite fit. It wasn't who I was. So now I'm a philosopher  and I study hard choices  and I can tell you that fear of the unknown  while a common motivational default in dealing with hard choices  rests on a misconception of them. It's a mistake to think that in hard choices  one alternative really is better than the other  but we're too stupid to know which  and since we don't know which  we might as well take the least risky option. Even taking two alternatives side by side with full information  a choice can still be hard. Hard choices are hard not because of us or our ignorance  they're hard because there is no best option. Now  if there's no best option  if the scales don't tip in favor of one alternative over another  then surely the alternatives must be equally good. So maybe the right thing to say in hard choices is that they're between equally good options. But that can't be right. If alternatives are equally good  you should just flip a coin between them  and it seems a mistake to think  here's how you should decide between careers  places to live  people to marry  Flip a coin. There's another reason for thinking that hard choices aren't choices between equally good options. Suppose you have a choice between two jobs  you could be an investment banker or a graphic artist. There are a variety of things that matter in such a choice  like the excitement of the work  achieving financial security  having time to raise a family  and so on. Maybe the artist's career puts you on the cutting edge of new forms of pictorial expression. Maybe the banking career puts you on the cutting edge of new forms of financial manipulation. Imagine the two jobs however you like so that neither is better than the other. Now suppose we improve one of them a bit. Suppose the bank  wooing you  adds     dollars a month to your salary. Does the extra money now make the banking job better than the artist one  Not necessarily. A higher salary makes the banking job better than it was before  but it might not be enough to make being a banker better than being an artist. But if an improvement in one of the jobs doesn't make it better than the other  then the two original jobs could not have been equally good. If you start with two things that are equally good  and you improve one of them  it now must be better than the other. That's not the case with options in hard choices. So now we've got a puzzle. We've got two jobs. Neither is better than the other  nor are they equally good. So how are we supposed to choose  Something seems to have gone wrong here. Maybe the choice itself is problematic and comparison is impossible. But that can't be right. It's not like we're trying to choose between two things that can't be compared. We're weighing the merits of two jobs  after all  not the merits of the number nine and a plate of fried eggs. A comparison of the overall merits of two jobs is something we can make  and one we often do make. I think the puzzle arises because of an unreflective assumption we make about value. We unwittingly assume that values like justice  beauty  kindness  are akin to scientific quantities  like length  mass and weight. Take any comparative question not involving value  such as which of two suitcases is heavier. There are only three possibilities. The weight of one is greater  lesser or equal to the weight of the other. Properties like weight can be represented by real numbers    one  two  three and so on    and there are only three possible comparisons between any two real numbers. One number is greater  lesser  or equal to the other. Not so with values. As post Enlightenment creatures  we tend to assume that scientific thinking holds the key to everything of importance in our world  but the world of value is different from the world of science. The stuff of the one world can be quantified by real numbers. The stuff of the other world can't. We shouldn't assume that the world of is  of lengths and weights  has the same structure as the world of ought  of what we should do. So if what matters to us    a child's delight  the love you have for your partner   can't be represented by real numbers  then there's no reason to believe that in choice  there are only three possibilities    that one alternative is better  worse or equal to the other. We need to introduce a new  fourth relation beyond being better  worse or equal  that describes what's going on in hard choices. I like to say that the alternatives are  on a par.  When alternatives are on a par  it may matter very much which you choose  but one alternative isn't better than the other. Rather  the alternatives are in the same neighborhood of value  in the same league of value  while at the same time being very different in kind of value. That's why the choice is hard. Understanding hard choices in this way uncovers something about ourselves we didn't know. Each of us has the power to create reasons. Imagine a world in which every choice you face is an easy choice  that is  there's always a best alternative. If there's a best alternative  then that's the one you should choose  because part of being rational is doing the better thing rather than the worse thing  choosing what you have most reason to choose. In such a world  we'd have most reason to wear black socks instead of pink socks  to eat cereal instead of donuts  to live in the city rather than the country  to marry Betty instead of Lolita. A world full of only easy choices would enslave us to reasons. When you think about it  it's nuts to believe that the reasons given to you dictated that you had most reason to pursue the exact hobbies you do  to live in the exact house you do  to work at the exact job you do. Instead  you faced alternatives that were on a par   hard choices   and you made reasons for yourself to choose that hobby  that house and that job. When alternatives are on a par  the reasons given to us  the ones that determine whether we're making a mistake  are silent as to what to do. It's here  in the space of hard choices  that we get to exercise our normative power  the power to create reasons for yourself  to make yourself into the kind of person for whom country living is preferable to the urban life. When we choose between options that are on a par  we can do something really rather remarkable. We can put our very selves behind an option. Here's where I stand. Here's who I am. I am for banking. I am for chocolate donuts. This response in hard choices is a rational response  but it's not dictated by reasons given to us. Rather  it's supported by reasons created by us. When we create reasons for ourselves to become this kind of person rather than that  we wholeheartedly become the people that we are. You might say that we become the authors of our own lives. So when we face hard choices  we shouldn't beat our head against a wall trying to figure out which alternative is better. There is no best alternative. Instead of looking for reasons out there  we should be looking for reasons in here  Who am I to be  You might decide to be a pink sock wearing  cereal loving  country living banker  and I might decide to be a black sock wearing  urban  donut loving artist. What we do in hard choices is very much up to each of us. Now  people who don't exercise their normative powers in hard choices are drifters. We all know people like that. I drifted into being a lawyer. I didn't put my agency behind lawyering. I wasn't for lawyering. Drifters allow the world to write the story of their lives. They let mechanisms of reward and punishment    pats on the head  fear  the easiness of an option   to determine what they do. So the lesson of hard choices  reflect on what you can put your agency behind  on what you can be for  and through hard choices  become that person. Far from being sources of agony and dread  hard choices are precious opportunities for us to celebrate what is special about the human condition  that the reasons that govern our choices as correct or incorrect sometimes run out  and it is here  in the space of hard choices  that we have the power to create reasons for ourselves to become the distinctive people that we are. And that's why hard choices are not a curse but a godsend. Thank you. Today  a baffled lady observed the shell where my soul dwells And announced that I'm  articulate  Which means that when it comes to enunciation and diction I don't even think of it  Cause I m  articulate  So when my professor asks a question And my answer is tainted with a connotation of urbanized suggestion There s no misdirected intention Pay attention  Cause I m  articulate  So when my father asks   Wha  kinda ting is dis   My  articulate  answer never goes amiss I say  father  this is the impending problem at hand  And when I m on the block I switch it up just because I can So when my boy says   What s good with you son   I just say   I jus  fall out wit dem people but I done   And sometimes in class I might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask  Yo  Why dese books neva be about my peoples  Yes  I have decided to treat all three of my languages as equals Because I m  articulate  But who controls articulation  Because the English language is a multifaceted oration Subject to indefinite transformation Now you may think that it is ignorant to speak broken English But I m here to tell you that even  articulate  Americans sound foolish to the British So when my Professor comes on the block and says   Hello  I stop him and say  Noooo   You re being inarticulate   the proper way is to say  what s good   Now you may think that s too hood  that s not cool But I m here to tell you that even our language has rules So when Mommy mocks me and says  ya ll be madd going to the store  I say  Mommy  no  that sentence is not following the law Never does the word  madd  go  before a present participle That s simply the principle of this English  If I had the vocal capacity I would sing this from every mountaintop  From every suburbia  and every hood  Cause the only God of language is the one recorded in the Genesis Of this world saying  it is good  So I may not always come before you with excellency of speech But do not judge me by my language and assume That I m too ignorant to teach  Cause I speak three tongues One for each  Home  school and friends I m a tri lingual orator Sometimes I m consistent with my language now Then switch it up so I don t bore later Sometimes I fight back two tongues While I use the other one in the classroom And when I mistakenly mix them up I feel crazy like   I m cooking in the bathroom I know that I had to borrow your language because mines was stolen But you can t expect me to speak your history wholly while mines is broken These words are spoken By someone who is simply fed up with the Eurocentric ideals of this season And the reason I speak a composite version of your language Is because mines was raped away along with my history I speak broken English so the profusing gashes can remind us That our current state is not a mystery I m so tired of the negative images that are driving my people mad So unless you ve seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair bad I m so sick of this nonsensical racial disparity So don t call it good unless your hair is known for donating to charity As much as has been raped away from our people How can you expect me to treat their imprint on your language As anything less than equal Let there be no confusion Let there be no hesitation This is not a promotion of ignorance This is a linguistic celebration That s why I put  tri lingual  on my last job application I can help to diversify your consumer market is all I wanted them to know And when they call me for the interview I ll be more than happy to show that I can say   What s good   Whatagwan  And of course   Hello  Because I m  articulate  Thank you.

Do they think  do they feel and  if so  how  So this afternoon  in my limited time  I wanted to take the guesswork out of a lot of that by introducing you to two dogs  both of whom have taken the command  speak  quite literally. The first dog is the first to go  and he is contemplating an aspect of his relationship to his owner  and the title is  A Dog on His Master.   As young as I look  I am growing older faster than he. Seven to one is the ratio  they tend to say. Whatever the number  I will pass him one day and take the lead  the way I do on our walks in the woods  and if this ever manages to cross his mind  it would be the sweetest shadow I have ever cast on snow or grass.  Thank you. And our next dog speaks in something called the revenant  which means a spirit that comes back to visit you.  I am the dog you put to sleep  as you like to call the needle of oblivion  come back to tell you this simple thing  I never liked you.   When I licked your face  I thought of biting off your nose. When I watched you toweling yourself dry  I wanted to leap and unman you with a snap. I resented the way you moved  your lack of animal grace  the way you would sit in a chair to eat  a napkin on your lap  a knife in your hand. I would have run away but I was too weak  a trick you taught me while I was learning to sit and heel and  greatest of insults  shake hands without a hand. I admit the sight of the leash would excite me  but only because it meant I was about to smell things you had never touched. You do not want to believe this  but I have no reason to lie  I hated the car  hated the rubber toys  disliked your friends  and worse  your relatives. The jingling of my tags drove me mad. You always scratched me in the wrong place.   All I ever wanted from you was food and water in my bowls. While you slept  I watched you breathe as the moon rose in the sky. It took all of my strength not to raise my head and howl. Now  I am free of the collar  free of the yellow raincoat  monogrammed sweater  the absurdity of your lawn  and that is all you need to know about this place  except what you already supposed and are glad it did not happen sooner  that everyone here can read and write  the dogs in poetry  the cats and all the others in prose.  Thank you. Twenty three years ago  at the age of     I shot and killed a man. I was a young drug dealer with a quick temper and a semi automatic pistol. But that wasn't the end of my story. In fact  it was beginning  and the    years since is a story of acknowledgment  apology and atonement. But it didn't happen in the way that you might imagine or think. These things occurred in my life in a way that was surprising  especially to me. See  like many of you  growing up  I was an honor roll student  a scholarship student  with dreams of becoming a doctor. But things went dramatically wrong when my parents separated and eventually divorced. The actual events are pretty straightforward. At the age of     I got shot three times standing on the corner of my block in Detroit. My friend rushed me to the hospital. Doctors pulled the bullets out  patched me up  and sent me back to the same  neighborhood where I got shot. Throughout this ordeal  no one hugged me  no one counseled me  no one told me I would be okay. No one told me that I would live in fear  that I would become paranoid  or that I would react hyper violently to being shot. No one told me that one day  I would become the person behind the trigger. Fourteen months later  at   a.m.  I fired the shots that caused a man's death. When I entered prison  I was bitter  I was angry  I was hurt. I didn't want to take responsibility. I blamed everybody from my parents to the system. I rationalized my decision to shoot because in the hood where I come from  it's better to be the shooter than the person getting shot. As I sat in my cold cell  I felt helpless  unloved and abandoned. I felt like nobody cared  and I reacted with hostility to my confinement. And I found myself getting deeper and deeper into trouble. I ran black market stores  I loan sharked  and I sold drugs that were illegally smuggled into the prison. I had in fact become what the warden of the Michigan Reformatory called  the worst of the worst.  And because of my activity  I landed in solitary confinement for seven and a half years out of my incarceration. Now as I see it  solitary confinement is one of the most inhumane and barbaric places you can find yourself  but find myself I did. One day  I was pacing my cell  when an officer came and delivered mail. I looked at a couple of letters before I looked at the letter that had my son's squiggly handwriting on it. And anytime I would get a letter from my son  it was like a ray of light in the darkest place you can imagine. And on this particular day  I opened this letter  and in capital letters  he wrote   My mama told me why you was in prison  murder.  He said   Dad  don't kill. Jesus watches what you do. Pray to Him.  Now  I wasn't religious at that time  nor am I religious now  but it was something so profound about my son's words. They made me examine things about my life that I hadn't considered. It was the first time in my life that I had actually thought about the fact that my son would see me as a murderer. I sat back on my bunk and I reflected on something I had read in  Plato   where Socrates stated in  Apology  that the unexamined life isn't worth living. At that point is when the transformation began. But it didn't come easy. One of the things I realized  which was part of the transformation  was that there were four key things. The first thing was  I had great mentors. Now  I know some of you all are probably thinking  how did you find a great mentor in prison  But in my case  some of my mentors who are serving life sentences were some of the best people to ever come into my life  because they forced me to look at my life honestly  and they forced me to challenge myself about my decision making. The second thing was literature. Prior to going to prison  I didn't know that there were so many brilliant black poets  authors and philosophers  and then I had the great fortune of encountering Malcolm X's autobiography  and it shattered every stereotype I had about myself. The third thing was family. For    years  my father stood by my side with an unshakable faith  because he believed that I had what it took to turn my life around. I also met an amazing woman who is now the mother of my two year old son Sekou  and she taught me how to love myself in a healthy way. The final thing was writing. When I got that letter from my son  I began to write a journal about things I had experienced in my childhood and in prison  and what it did is it opened up my mind to the idea of atonement. Earlier in my incarceration  I had received a letter from one of the relatives of my victim  and in that letter  she told me she forgave me  because she realized I was a young child who had been abused and had been through some hardships and just made a series of poor decisions. It was the first time in my life that I ever felt open to forgiving myself. One of the things that happened after that experience is that I thought about the other men who were incarcerated alongside of me  and how much I wanted to share this with them. And so I started talking to them about some of their experiences  and I was devastated to realize that most of them came from the same abusive environments  And most of them wanted help and they wanted to turn it around  but unfortunately the system that currently holds  .  million people in prison is designed to warehouse as opposed to rehabilitate or transform. So I made it up in my mind that if I was ever released from prison that I would do everything in my power to help change that. In       I walked out of prison for the first time after two decades. Now imagine  if you will  Fred Flintstone walking into an episode of  The Jetsons.  That was pretty much what my life was like. For the first time  I was exposed to the Internet  social media  cars that talk like KITT from  Knight Rider.  But the thing that fascinated me the most was phone technology. See  when I went to prison  our car phones were this big and required two people to carry them. So imagine what it was like when I first grabbed my little Blackberry and I started learning how to text. But the thing is  the people around me  they didn't realize that I had no idea what all these abbreviated texts meant  like LOL  OMG  LMAO  until one day I was having a conversation with one of my friends via text  and I asked him to do something  and he responded back   K.  And I was like   What is K   And he was like   K is okay.  So in my head  I was like   Well what the hell is wrong with K   And so I text him a question mark. And he said   K   okay.  And so I tap back   FU.   Laughter  And then he texts back  and he asks me why was I cussing him out. And I said   LOL FU   as in  I finally understand. And so fast forward three years  I'm doing relatively good. I have a fellowship at MIT Media Lab  I work for an amazing company called BMe  I teach at the University of Michigan  but it's been a struggle because I realize that there are more men and women coming home who are not going to be afforded those opportunities. I've been blessed to work with some amazing men and women  helping others reenter society  and one of them is my friend named Calvin Evans. He served    years for a crime he didn't commit. He's    years old. He's currently enrolled in college. And one of the things that we talked about is the three things that I found important in my personal transformation  the first being acknowledgment. I had to acknowledge that I had hurt others. I also had to acknowledge that I had been hurt. The second thing was apologizing. I had to apologize to the people I had hurt. Even though I had no expectations of them accepting it  it was important to do because it was the right thing. But I also had to apologize to myself. The third thing was atoning. For me  atoning meant going back into my community and working with at risk youth who were on the same path  but also becoming at one with myself. Through my experience of being locked up  one of the things I discovered is this  the majority of men and women who are incarcerated are redeemable  and the fact is     percent of the men and women who are incarcerated will at some point return to the community  and we have a role in determining what kind of men and women return to our community. My wish today is that we will embrace a more empathetic approach toward how we deal with mass incarceration  that we will do away with the lock them up and throw away the key mentality  because it's proven it doesn't work. My journey is a unique journey  but it doesn't have to be that way. Anybody can have a transformation if we create the space for that to happen. So what I'm asking today is that you envision a world where men and women aren't held hostage to their pasts  where misdeeds and mistakes don't define you for the rest of your life. I think collectively  we can create that reality  and I hope you do too. Thank you. I am a computer science and engineering professor here at Carnegie Mellon  and my research focuses on usable privacy and security  and so my friends like to give me examples of their frustrations with computing systems  especially frustrations related to unusable privacy and security. So passwords are something that I hear a lot about. A lot of people are frustrated with passwords  and it's bad enough when you have to have one really good password that you can remember but nobody else is going to be able to guess. But what do you do when you have accounts on a hundred different systems and you're supposed to have a unique password for each of these systems  It's tough. At Carnegie Mellon  they used to make it actually pretty easy for us to remember our passwords. The password requirement up through      was just that you had to have a password with at least one character. Pretty easy. But then they changed things  and at the end of       they announced that we were going to have a new policy  and this new policy required passwords that were at least eight characters long  with an uppercase letter  lowercase letter  a digit  a symbol  you couldn't use the same character more than three times  and it wasn't allowed to be in a dictionary. Now  when they implemented this new policy  a lot of people  my colleagues and friends  came up to me and they said   Wow  now that's really unusable. Why are they doing this to us  and why didn't you stop them   And I said   Well  you know what  They didn't ask me.  But I got curious  and I decided to go talk to the people in charge of our computer systems and find out what led them to introduce this new policy  and they said that the university had joined a consortium of universities  and one of the requirements of membership was that we had to have stronger passwords that complied with some new requirements  and these requirements were that our passwords had to have a lot of entropy. Now entropy is a complicated term  but basically it measures the strength of passwords. But the thing is  there isn't actually a standard measure of entropy. Now  the National Institute of Standards and Technology has a set of guidelines which have some rules of thumb for measuring entropy  but they don't have anything too specific  and the reason they only have rules of thumb is it turns out they don't actually have any good data on passwords. In fact  their report states   Unfortunately  we do not have much data on the passwords users choose under particular rules. NIST would like to obtain more data on the passwords users actually choose  but system administrators are understandably reluctant to reveal password data to others.  So this is a problem  but our research group looked at it as an opportunity. We said   Well  there's a need for good password data. Maybe we can collect some good password data and actually advance the state of the art here. So the first thing we did is  we got a bag of candy bars and we walked around campus and talked to students  faculty and staff  and asked them for information about their passwords. Now we didn't say   Give us your password.  No  we just asked them about their password. How long is it  Does it have a digit  Does it have a symbol  And were you annoyed at having to create a new one last week  So we got results from     students  faculty and staff  and indeed we confirmed that the new policy was very annoying  but we also found that people said they felt more secure with these new passwords. We found that most people knew they were not supposed to write their password down  and only    percent of them did  but disturbingly     percent of people said they were reusing their password. Now  this is actually more dangerous than writing your password down  because it makes you much more susceptible to attackers. So if you have to  write your passwords down  but don't reuse them. We also found some interesting things about the symbols people use in passwords. So CMU allows    possible symbols  but as you can see  there's only a small number that most people are using  so we're not actually getting very much strength from the symbols in our passwords. So this was a really interesting study  and now we had data from     people  but in the scheme of things  that's really not very much password data  and so we looked around to see where could we find additional password data  So it turns out there are a lot of people going around stealing passwords  and they often go and post these passwords on the Internet. So we were able to get access to some of these stolen password sets. This is still not really ideal for research  though  because it's not entirely clear where all of these passwords came from  or exactly what policies were in effect when people created these passwords. So we wanted to find some better source of data. So we decided that one thing we could do is we could do a study and have people actually create passwords for our study. So we used a service called Amazon Mechanical Turk  and this is a service where you can post a small job online that takes a minute  a few minutes  an hour  and pay people  a penny  ten cents  a few dollars  to do a task for you  and then you pay them through Amazon.com. So we paid people about    cents to create a password following our rules and answering a survey  and then we paid them again to come back two days later and log in using their password and answering another survey. So we did this  and we collected       passwords  and we gave people a bunch of different policies to create passwords with. So some people had a pretty easy policy  we call it Basic   and here the only rule was that your password had to have at least eight characters. Then some people had a much harder policy  and this was very similar to the CMU policy  that it had to have eight characters including uppercase  lowercase  digit  symbol  and pass a dictionary check. And one of the other policies we tried  and there were a whole bunch more  but one of the ones we tried was called Basic    and the only requirement here was that your password had to have at least    characters. All right  so now we had       passwords  and so we had much more detailed information. Again we see that there's only a small number of symbols that people are actually using in their passwords. We also wanted to get an idea of how strong the passwords were that people were creating  but as you may recall  there isn't a good measure of password strength. So what we decided to do was to see how long it would take to crack these passwords using the best cracking tools that the bad guys are using  or that we could find information about in the research literature. So to give you an idea of how bad guys go about cracking passwords  they will steal a password file that will have all of the passwords in kind of a scrambled form  called a hash  and so what they'll do is they'll make a guess as to what a password is  run it through a hashing function  and see whether it matches the passwords they have on their stolen password list. So a dumb attacker will try every password in order. They'll start with AAAAA and move on to AAAAB  and this is going to take a really long time before they get any passwords that people are really likely to actually have. A smart attacker  on the other hand  does something much more clever. They look at the passwords that are known to be popular from these stolen password sets  and they guess those first. So they're going to start by guessing  password   and then they'll guess  I love you   and  monkey   and             because these are the passwords that are most likely for people to have. In fact  some of you probably have these passwords. So what we found by running all of these       passwords we collected through these tests to see how strong they were  we found that the long passwords were actually pretty strong  and the complex passwords were pretty strong too. However  when we looked at the survey data  we saw that people were really frustrated by the very complex passwords  and the long passwords were a lot more usable  and in some cases  they were actually even stronger than the complex passwords. So this suggests that  instead of telling people that they need to put all these symbols and numbers and crazy things into their passwords  we might be better off just telling people to have long passwords. Now here's the problem  though  Some people had long passwords that actually weren't very strong. You can make long passwords that are still the sort of thing that an attacker could easily guess. So we need to do more than just say long passwords. There has to be some additional requirements  and some of our ongoing research is looking at what additional requirements we should add to make for stronger passwords that also are going to be easy for people to remember and type. Another approach to getting people to have stronger passwords is to use a password meter. Here are some examples. You may have seen these on the Internet when you were creating passwords. We decided to do a study to find out whether these password meters actually work. Do they actually help people have stronger passwords  and if so  which ones are better  So we tested password meters that were different sizes  shapes  colors  different words next to them  and we even tested one that was a dancing bunny. As you type a better password  the bunny dances faster and faster. So this was pretty fun. What we found was that password meters do work. Most of the password meters were actually effective  and the dancing bunny was very effective too  but the password meters that were the most effective were the ones that made you work harder before they gave you that thumbs up and said you were doing a good job  and in fact we found that most of the password meters on the Internet today are too soft. They tell you you're doing a good job too early  and if they would just wait a little bit before giving you that positive feedback  you probably would have better passwords. Now another approach to better passwords  perhaps  is to use pass phrases instead of passwords. So this was an xkcd cartoon  from a couple of years ago  and the cartoonist suggests that we should all use pass phrases  and if you look at the second row of this cartoon  you can see the cartoonist is suggesting that the pass phrase  correct horse battery staple  would be a very strong pass phrase and something really easy to remember. He says  in fact  you've already remembered it. And so we decided to do a research study to find out whether this was true or not. In fact  everybody who I talk to  who I mention I'm doing password research  they point out this cartoon.  Oh  have you seen it  That xkcd. Correct horse battery staple.  So we did the research study to see what would actually happen. So in our study  we used Mechanical Turk again  and we had the computer pick the random words in the pass phrase. Now the reason we did this is that humans are not very good at picking random words. If we asked a human to do it  they would pick things that were not very random. So we tried a few different conditions. In one condition  the computer picked from a dictionary of the very common words in the English language  and so you'd get pass phrases like  try there three come.  And we looked at that  and we said   Well  that doesn't really seem very memorable.  So then we tried picking words that came from specific parts of speech  so how about noun verb adjective noun. That comes up with something that's sort of sentence like. So you can get a pass phrase like  plan builds sure power  or  end determines red drug.  And these seemed a little bit more memorable  and maybe people would like those a little bit better. We wanted to compare them with passwords  and so we had the computer pick random passwords  and these were nice and short  but as you can see  they don't really look very memorable. And then we decided to try something called a pronounceable password. So here the computer picks random syllables and puts them together so you have something sort of pronounceable  like  tufritvi  and  vadasabi.  That one kind of rolls off your tongue. So these were random passwords that were generated by our computer. So what we found in this study was that  surprisingly  pass phrases were not actually all that good. People were not really better at remembering the pass phrases than these random passwords  and because the pass phrases are longer  they took longer to type and people made more errors while typing them in. So it's not really a clear win for pass phrases. Sorry  all of you xkcd fans. On the other hand  we did find that pronounceable passwords worked surprisingly well  and so we actually are doing some more research to see if we can make that approach work even better. So one of the problems with some of the studies that we've done is that because they're all done using Mechanical Turk  these are not people's real passwords. They're the passwords that they created or the computer created for them for our study. And we wanted to know whether people would actually behave the same way with their real passwords. So we talked to the information security office at Carnegie Mellon and asked them if we could have everybody's real passwords. Not surprisingly  they were a little bit reluctant to share them with us  but we were actually able to work out a system with them where they put all of the real passwords for        CMU students  faculty and staff  into a locked computer in a locked room  not connected to the Internet  and they ran code on it that we wrote to analyze these passwords. They audited our code. They ran the code. And so we never actually saw anybody's password. We got some interesting results  and those of you Tepper students in the back will be very interested in this. So we found that the passwords created by people affiliated with the school of computer science were actually  .  times stronger than those affiliated with the business school. We have lots of other really interesting demographic information as well. The other interesting thing that we found is that when we compared the Carnegie Mellon passwords to the Mechanical Turk generated passwords  there was actually a lot of similarities  and so this helped validate our research method and show that actually  collecting passwords using these Mechanical Turk studies is actually a valid way to study passwords. So that was good news. Okay  I want to close by talking about some insights I gained while on sabbatical last year in the Carnegie Mellon art school. One of the things that I did is I made a number of quilts  and I made this quilt here. It's called  Security Blanket.  And this quilt has the       most frequent passwords stolen from the RockYou website. And the size of the passwords is proportional to how frequently they appeared in the stolen dataset. And what I did is I created this word cloud  and I went through all       words  and I categorized them into loose thematic categories. And it was  in some cases  it was kind of difficult to figure out what category they should be in  and then I color coded them. So here are some examples of the difficulty. So  justin.  Is that the name of the user  their boyfriend  their son  Maybe they're a Justin Bieber fan. Or  princess.  Is that a nickname  Are they Disney princess fans  Or maybe that's the name of their cat.  Iloveyou  appears many times in many different languages. There's a lot of love in these passwords. If you look carefully  you'll see there's also some profanity  but it was really interesting to me to see that there's a lot more love than hate in these passwords. And there are animals  a lot of animals  and  monkey  is the most common animal and the   th most popular password overall. And this was really curious to me  and I wondered   Why are monkeys so popular   And so in our last password study  any time we detected somebody creating a password with the word  monkey  in it  we asked them why they had a monkey in their password. And what we found out    we found    people so far  I think  who have the word  monkey     We found out about a third of them said they have a pet named  monkey  or a friend whose nickname is  monkey   and about a third of them said that they just like monkeys and monkeys are really cute. And that guy is really cute. So it seems that at the end of the day  when we make passwords  we either make something that's really easy to type  a common pattern  or things that remind us of the word password or the account that we've created the password for  or whatever. Or we think about things that make us happy  and we create our password based on things that make us happy. And while this makes typing and remembering your password more fun  it also makes it a lot easier to guess your password. So I know a lot of these TED Talks are inspirational and they make you think about nice  happy things  but when you're creating your password  try to think about something else. Thank you. Every day we face issues like climate change or the safety of vaccines where we have to answer questions whose answers rely heavily on scientific information. Scientists tell us that the world is warming. Scientists tell us that vaccines are safe. But how do we know if they are right  Why should be believe the science  The fact is  many of us actually don't believe the science. Public opinion polls consistently show that significant proportions of the American people don't believe the climate is warming due to human activities  don't think that there is evolution by natural selection  and aren't persuaded by the safety of vaccines. So why should we believe the science  Well  scientists don't like talking about  science as a matter of belief. In fact  they would contrast science with faith  and they would say belief is the domain of faith. And faith is a separate thing apart and distinct from science. Indeed they would say religion is based on faith or maybe the calculus of Pascal's wager. Blaise Pascal was a   th century mathematician who tried to bring scientific reasoning to the question of whether or not he should believe in God  and his wager went like this  Well  if God doesn't exist but I decide to believe in him nothing much is really lost. Maybe a few hours on Sunday. But if he does exist and I don't believe in him  then I'm in deep trouble. And so Pascal said  we'd better believe in God. Or as one of my college professors said   He clutched for the handrail of faith.  He made that leap of faith leaving science and rationalism behind. Now the fact is though  for most of us  most scientific claims are a leap of faith. We can't really judge scientific claims for ourselves in most cases. And indeed this is actually true for most scientists as well outside of their own specialties. So if you think about it  a geologist can't tell you whether a vaccine is safe. Most chemists are not experts in evolutionary theory. A physicist cannot tell you  despite the claims of some of them  whether or not tobacco causes cancer. So  if even scientists themselves have to make a leap of faith outside their own fields  then why do they accept the claims of other scientists  Why do they believe each other's claims  And should we believe those claims  So what I'd like to argue is yes  we should  but not for the reason that most of us think. Most of us were taught in school that the reason we should believe in science is because of the scientific method. We were taught that scientists follow a method and that this method guarantees the truth of their claims. The method that most of us were taught in school  we can call it the textbook method  is the hypothetical deductive method. According to the standard model  the textbook model  scientists develop hypotheses  they deduce the consequences of those hypotheses  and then they go out into the world and they say   Okay  well are those consequences true   Can we observe them taking place in the natural world  And if they are true  then the scientists say   Great  we know the hypothesis is correct.  So there are many famous examples in the history of science of scientists doing exactly this. One of the most famous examples comes from the work of Albert Einstein. When Einstein developed the theory of general relativity  one of the consequences of his theory was that space time wasn't just an empty void but that it actually had a fabric. And that that fabric was bent in the presence of massive objects like the sun. So if this theory were true then it meant that light as it passed the sun should actually be bent around it. That was a pretty startling prediction and it took a few years before scientists were able to test it but they did test it in       and lo and behold it turned out to be true. Starlight actually does bend as it travels around the sun. This was a huge confirmation of the theory. It was considered proof of the truth of this radical new idea  and it was written up in many newspapers around the globe. Now  sometimes this theory or this model is referred to as the deductive nomological model  mainly because academics like  to make things complicated. But also because in the ideal case  it's about laws. So nomological means having to do with laws. And in the ideal case  the hypothesis isn't just an idea  ideally  it is a law of nature. Why does it matter that it is a law of nature  Because if it is a law  it can't be broken. If it's a law then it will always be true in all times and all places no matter what the circumstances are. And all of you know of at least one example of a famous law  Einstein's famous equation  E MC   which tells us what the relationship is between energy and mass. And that relationship is true no matter what. Now  it turns out  though  that there  are several problems with this model. The main problem is that it's wrong. It's just not true.  Laughter  And I'm going to talk about three reasons why it's wrong. So the first reason is a logical reason. It's the problem of the fallacy of affirming the consequent. So that's another fancy  academic way of saying that false theories can make true predictions. So just because the prediction comes true doesn't actually logically prove that the theory is correct. And I have a good example of that too   again from the history of science. This is a picture of the Ptolemaic universe with the Earth at the center of the universe and the sun and the planets going around it. The Ptolemaic model was believed by many very smart people for many centuries. Well  why  Well the answer is because it made  lots of predictions that came true. The Ptolemaic system enabled astronomers to make accurate predictions of the motions of the planet  in fact more accurate predictions at first than the Copernican theory which we now would say is true. So that's one problem with the textbook model. A second problem is a practical problem  and it's the problem of auxiliary hypotheses. Auxiliary hypotheses are assumptions that scientists are making that they may or may not even be aware that they're making. So an important example of this comes from the Copernican model  which ultimately replaced the Ptolemaic system. So when Nicolaus Copernicus said  actually the Earth is not the center of the universe  the sun is the center of the solar system  the Earth moves around the sun. Scientists said  well okay  Nicolaus  if that's true we ought to be able to detect the motion of the Earth around the sun. And so this slide here illustrates a concept known as stellar parallax. And astronomers said  if the Earth is moving and we look at a prominent star  let's say  Sirius    well I know I'm in Manhattan so you guys can't see the stars  but imagine you're out in the country   imagine you chose that rural life   and we look at a star in December  we see that star against the backdrop of distant stars. If we now make the same observation six months later when the Earth has moved to this position in June  we look at that same star and we  see it against a different backdrop. That difference  that angular difference  is the stellar parallax. So this is a prediction that the Copernican model makes. Astronomers looked for the stellar parallax and they found nothing  nothing at all. And many people argued that this proved  that the Copernican model was false. So what happened  Well  in hindsight we can say  that astronomers were making two auxiliary hypotheses  both of which we would now say were incorrect. The first was an assumption  about the size of the Earth's orbit. Astronomers were assuming  that the Earth's orbit was large relative to the distance to the stars. Today we would draw the picture more like this  this comes from NASA  and you see the Earth's orbit is actually quite small. In fact  it's actually much smaller even than shown here. The stellar parallax therefore  is very small and actually very hard to detect. And that leads to the second reason why the prediction didn't work  because scientists were also assuming that the telescopes they had were sensitive enough to detect the parallax. And that turned out not to be true. It wasn't until the   th century that scientists were able to detect the stellar parallax. So  there's a third problem as well. The third problem is simply a factual problem  that a lot of science doesn't fit the textbook model. A lot of science isn't deductive at all  it's actually inductive. And by that we mean that scientists don't necessarily start with theories and hypotheses  often they just start with observations of stuff going on in the world. And the most famous example of that is one of the most famous scientists who ever lived  Charles Darwin. When Darwin went out as a young  man on the voyage of the Beagle  he didn't have a hypothesis  he didn't have a theory. He just knew that he wanted to have a career as a scientist and he started to collect data. Mainly he knew that he hated medicine because the sight of blood made him sick so he had to have an alternative career path. So he started collecting data. And he collected many things   including his famous finches. When he collected these finches  he threw them in a bag and he had no idea what they meant. Many years later back in London  Darwin looked at his data again and began to develop an explanation  and that explanation was the theory of natural selection. Besides inductive science  scientists also often participate in modeling. One of the things scientists want to do in life is to explain the causes of things. And how do we do that  Well  one way you can do it is to build a model that tests an idea. So this is a picture of Henry Cadell  who was a Scottish geologist in the   th century. You can tell he's Scottish because he's wearing a deerstalker cap and Wellington boots. And Cadell wanted to answer the question  how are mountains formed  And one of the things he had observed is that if you look at mountains like the Appalachians  you often find that the rocks in them are folded  and they're folded in a particular way  which suggested to him that they were actually being compressed from the side. And this idea would later play a major role in discussions of continental drift. So he built this model  this crazy contraption with levers and wood  and here's his wheelbarrow  buckets  a big sledgehammer. I don't know why he's got the Wellington boots. Maybe it's going to rain. And he created this physical model in order to demonstrate that you could  in fact  create patterns in rocks  or at least  in this case  in mud  that looked a lot like mountains if you compressed them from the side. So it was an argument about the cause of mountains. Nowadays  most scientists prefer to work inside  so they don't build physical models so much as to make computer simulations. But a computer simulation is a kind of a model. It's a model that's made with mathematics  and like the physical models of the   th century  it's very important for thinking about causes. So one of the big questions to do with climate change  we have tremendous amounts of evidence that the Earth is warming up. This slide here  the black line shows the measurements that scientists have taken for the last     years showing that the Earth's temperature has steadily increased  and you can see in particular that in the last    years there's been this dramatic increase of nearly one degree centigrade  or almost two degrees Fahrenheit. So what  though  is driving that change  How can we know what's causing the observed warming  Well  scientists can model it using a computer simulation. So this diagram illustrates a computer simulation that has looked at all the different factors that we know can influence the Earth's climate  so sulfate particles from air pollution  volcanic dust from volcanic eruptions  changes in solar radiation  and  of course  greenhouse gases. And they asked the question  what set of variables put into a model will reproduce what we actually see in real life  So here is the real life in black. Here's the model in this light gray  and the answer is a model that includes  it's the answer E on that SAT  all of the above. The only way you can reproduce the observed temperature measurements is with all of these things put together  including greenhouse gases  and in particular you can see that the increase in greenhouse gases tracks this very dramatic increase in temperature over the last    years. And so this is why climate scientists say it's not just that we know that climate change is happening  we know that greenhouse gases are a major part of the reason why. So now because there all these different things that scientists do  the philosopher Paul Feyerabend famously said   The only principle in science that doesn't inhibit progress is  anything goes.  Now this quotation has often been taken out of context  because Feyerabend was not actually saying that in science anything goes. What he was saying was  actually the full quotation is   If you press me to say what is the method of science  I would have to say  anything goes.  What he was trying to say is that scientists do a lot of different things. Scientists are creative. But then this pushes the question back  If scientists don't use a single method  then how do they decide what's right and what's wrong  And who judges  And the answer is  scientists judge  and they judge by judging evidence. Scientists collect evidence in many different ways  but however they collect it  they have to subject it to scrutiny. And this led the sociologist Robert Merton to focus on this question of how scientists scrutinize data and evidence  and he said they do it in a way he called  organized skepticism.  And by that he meant it's organized because they do it collectively  they do it as a group  and skepticism  because they do it from a position of distrust. That is to say  the burden of proof is on the person with a novel claim. And in this sense  science is intrinsically conservative. It's quite hard to persuade the scientific community to say   Yes  we know something  this is true.  So despite the popularity of the concept of paradigm shifts  what we find is that actually  really major changes in scientific thinking are relatively rare in the history of science. So finally that brings us to one more idea  If scientists judge evidence collectively  this has led historians to focus on the question of consensus  and to say that at the end of the day  what science is  what scientific knowledge is  is the consensus of the scientific experts who through this process of organized scrutiny  collective scrutiny  have judged the evidence and come to a conclusion about it  either yea or nay. So we can think of scientific knowledge as a consensus of experts. We can also think of science as being a kind of a jury  except it's a very special kind of jury. It's not a jury of your peers  it's a jury of geeks. It's a jury of men and women with Ph.D.s  and unlike a conventional jury  which has only two choices  guilty or not guilty  the scientific jury actually has a number of choices. Scientists can say yes  something's true. Scientists can say no  it's false. Or  they can say  well it might be true but we need to work more and collect more evidence. Or  they can say it might be true  but we don't know how to answer the question and we're going to put it aside and maybe we'll come back to it later. That's what scientists call  intractable.  But this leads us to one final problem  If science is what scientists say it is  then isn't that just an appeal to authority  And weren't we all taught in school that the appeal to authority is a logical fallacy  Well  here's the paradox of modern science  the paradox of the conclusion I think historians and philosophers and sociologists have come to  that actually science is the appeal to authority  but it's not the authority of the individual  no matter how smart that individual is  like Plato or Socrates or Einstein. It's the authority of the collective community. You can think of it is a kind of wisdom of the crowd  but a very special kind of crowd. Science does appeal to authority  but it's not based on any individual  no matter how smart that individual may be. It's based on the collective wisdom  the collective knowledge  the collective work  of all of the scientists who have worked on a particular problem. Scientists have a kind of culture of collective distrust  this  show me  culture  illustrated by this nice woman here showing her colleagues her evidence. Of course  these people don't really look like scientists  because they're much too happy. Okay  so that brings me to my final point. Most of us get up in the morning. Most of us trust our cars. Well  see  now I'm thinking  I'm in Manhattan  this is a bad analogy  but most Americans who don't live in Manhattan get up in the morning and get in their cars and turn on that ignition  and their cars work  and they work incredibly well. The modern automobile hardly ever breaks down. So why is that  Why do cars work so well  It's not because of the genius of Henry Ford or Karl Benz or even Elon Musk. It's because the modern automobile is the product of more than     years of work by hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of people. The modern automobile is the product of the collected work and wisdom and experience of every man and woman who has ever worked on a car  and the reliability of the technology is the result of that accumulated effort. We benefit not just from the genius of Benz and Ford and Musk but from the collective intelligence and hard work of all of the people who have worked on the modern car. And the same is true of science  only science is even older. Our basis for trust in science is actually the same as our basis in trust in technology  and the same as our basis for trust in anything  namely  experience. But it shouldn't be blind trust any more than we would have blind trust in anything. Our trust in science  like science itself  should be based on evidence  and that means that scientists have to become better communicators. They have to explain to us not just what they know but how they know it  and it means that we have to become better listeners. Thank you very much. I want to talk to you about one thing and just one thing only  and this has to do with when people ask me  what do you do  To which I usually respond  I do computer music. Now  a number of people just stop talking to me right then and there  and the rest who are left usually have this blank look in their eye  as if to say  what does that mean  And I feel like I'm actually depriving them of information by telling them this  at which point I usually panic and spit out the first thing that comes to my mind  which is  I have no idea what I'm doing. Which is true. That's usually followed by a second thought  which is  whatever it is that I'm doing  I love it. And today  I want to  well  share with you something I love  and also why. And I think we'll begin with just this question  What is computer music  And I'm going to try to do my best to provide a definition  maybe by telling you a story that goes through some of the stuff I've been working on. And the first thing  I think  in our story is going to be something called ChucK. Now  ChucK is a programming language for music  and it's open source  it's freely available  and I like to think that it crashes equally well on all modern operating systems. And instead of telling you more about it  I'm just going to give you a demo. By the way  I'm just going to nerd out for just a few minutes here  so I would say  don't freak out. In fact  I would invite all of you to join me in just geeking out. If you've never written a line of code before in your life  do not worry. I'll bet you'll be able to come along on this. First thing I'm going to do is to make a sine wave oscillator  and we're going to called the sine wave generator  Ge.  And then we're going to connect  Ge  to the DAC. Now this is kind of the abstraction for the sound output on my computer. Okay  So I've connected myself into the speaker. Next  I'm going to say my frequency is     hertz  and I'm going to let time advance by two seconds through this operation. All right  so if I were to play this    you would hear a sine wave at     hertz for two seconds. Okay  great. Now I'm going to copy and paste this  and then just change some of these numbers     .       I shall leave it as that  and .  and    . By doubling the frequency  we're actually going up in successive octaves  and then we have this sequence    Okay  great  now I can imagine creating all kinds of really horrible single sine wave pieces of music with this  but I'm going to do something that computers are really good at  which is repetition. I'm going to put this all in a while loop  and you actually don't need to indent  but this is purely for aesthetic reasons. It's good practice. And when we do this   that's going to go on for a while. In fact  it's probably not going to stop until this computer disintegrates. And I can't really empirically prove that to you  but I hope you'll believe me when I say that. Next  I'm going to replace this     by math.random f. I'm going to generate a random number between    and       and send that to the frequency of me. And I'm going to do this every half a second. Let's do this every     milliseconds. One hundred. All right. At this point  we've reached something that I would like to think of as the canonical computer music. This is  to me  the sound that mainframes are supposed to be making when they're thinking really hard. It's this sound  it's like  the square root of five million. So is this computer music  Yeah  I guess by definition  it's kind of computer music. It's probably not the kind of music you would listen to cruising down the highway  but it's a foundation of computer generated music  and using ChucK  we've actually been building instruments in the Stanford Laptop Orchestra  based right here at Stanford Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. Now the Laptop Orchestra is an ensemble of laptops  humans and special hemispherical speaker arrays. Now the reason we have these is so that for the instruments that we create out of the laptop  we want the sound to come out of somewhere near the instrument and the performer  kind of much like a traditional  acoustic instrument. Like  if I were to play a violin here  the sound would naturally not come out of the P.A. system  but from the artifact itself. So these speakers are meant to emulate that. In fact  I'm going to show you how we actually built them. The first step is to go to IKEA and buy a salad bowl. This is an    inch Blanda Matt. That's the actual name  and I actually use one of these to make salad at home as well  I kid you not. And the first step is you turn it upside down  and then you drill holes in them  six holes per hemi  and then make a base plate  put car speaker drivers in them along with amplifiers in the enclosure  and you put that all together and you have these hemispherical speaker arrays. Add people  add laptops  you have a laptop orchestra. And what might a laptop orchestra sound like  Well  let me give you a demonstration of about     instruments we've created so far for the Laptop Orchestra. And what I'm going to do is actually come over to this thing. This thing I have in front of me actually used to be a commodity gaming controller called a Gametrak. This thing actually has a glove you can put on your hands. It's tethered to the base  and this will track the position of your hands in real time. It was originally designed as a golfing controller to detect the motion of your swing. That turned out to be a rather large commercial non success  at which point they slashed prices to    dollars  at which point computer music researchers said   This is awesome  We can prototype instruments out of this.  So let me show you one instrument we've created  one of many  and this instrument is called  Twilight   and it's meant to go with this metaphor of pulling a sound out of the ground. So let me see if this will work. And put it back. And then if you go to the left  right  it sounds like an elephant in pain. This is a slightly metallic sound. Turn it just a bit. It's like a hovering car. Okay. This third one is a ratchet like interaction  so let me turn it up. So it's a slightly different interaction. The fourth one is a drone. And finally  let's see  this is a totally different interaction  and I think you have to imagine that there's this giant invisible drum sitting right here on stage  and I'm going to bang it. So there we go  so that's one of many instruments in the Laptop Orchestra. Thank you. And when you put that together  you get something that sounds like this. Okay  and so  I think from the experience of building a lot of instruments for the Laptop Orchestra  and I think from the curiosity of wondering  what if we took these hopefully expressive instruments and we brought it to a lot of people  plus then a healthy bout of insanity   put those three things together   led to me actually co founding a startup company in      called Smule. Now Smule's mission is to create expressive  mobile music things  and one of the first musical instruments we created is called Ocarina. And I'm going to just demo this for you real quick. So Ocarina   is based on this ancient flute like instrument called the ocarina  and this one is the four hole English pendant configuration  and you're literally blowing into the microphone to make the sound. And there's actually a little ChucK script running in here that's detecting the strength of your blowing and also synthesizing the sound. And vibrato is mapped to the accelerometer  so you can get   All right. So let me play a little ditty for you  a little Bach. And here  you'll hear a little accompaniment with the melody. The accompaniment actually follows the melody  not the other way around. And this was designed to let you take your time and figure out where your expressive space is  and you can just hang out here for a while  for a really dramatic effect  if you want  and whenever you're ready   And on these longer notes  I'm going to use more vibrato towards the end of the notes to give it a little bit more of an expressive quality. Huh  that's a nice chord to end this excerpt on. Thank you. So I think a good question to ask about Ocarina is  is this a toy or it an instrument  Maybe it's both  but for me  I think the more important question is  is it expressive  And at the same time  I think creating these types of instruments asks a question about the role of technology  and its place for how we make music. Apparently  for example  not that long ago  like only a hundred years ago   that's not that long in the course of human history   families back then used to make music together as a common form of entertainment. I don't think that's really happening that much anymore. You know  this is before radio  before recording. In the last hundred years  with all this technology  we now have more access to music as listeners and consumers  but somehow  I think we're making less music than ever before. I'm not sure why that would be. Maybe it's because it's too easy just to hit play. And while listening to music is wonderful  there's a special joy to making music that's all its own. And I think that's one part of the goal of why I do what I do is kind of to take us back to the past a little bit. Right  Now  if that's one goal  the other goal is to look to the future and think about what kind of new musical things can we make that we don't perhaps yet have names for that's enabled by technology  but ultimately might change the way that humans make music. And I'll just give you one example here  and this is Ocarina's other feature. This is a globe  and here you're actually listening to other users of Ocarina blow into their iPhones to play something. This is  G.I.R.  from Texas   R.I.K.  I don't know why it's these three letter names today  Los Angeles. They're all playing pretty  somewhat minimal music here. And the idea with this is that  well  technology should not be foregrounded here  and    Laughter    we've actually opened this up. The first thought is that  hey  you know there's somebody somewhere out there playing some music  and this is a small but I think important human connection to make that perhaps the technology affords. As a final example  and perhaps my favorite example  is that in the wake of the      earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan  a woman reached out in one of our singing apps to try to get people to join in to sing with her on a version of  Lean on Me.  Now  in these apps  there's this thing that allows any user to add their voice to an existing performance by any other user or group of users  so in some sense  she's created this kind of global ad hoc corral of strangers  and within weeks  thousands of people joined in on this  and you can kind of see people coming from all around the world and all these lines converging on the origin where the first rendition of the song was sung  and that's in Tokyo. And this is what it sounds like  when there's       people. This is       voices.   We all have pain  we all have sorrow     But if we are wise     We know that there's always tomorrow     Lean on me     When you're not strong     And I'll be your friend     I'll help you carry on     For it won't be long     Till I'm gonna need     Somebody to lean on     Just lean on     Is this computer music  Was that computer music  Yeah  I guess so  it's something that you really couldn't have done without computers. But at the same time  it's also just human  and I think what I've essentially answered so far is maybe why I do the stuff that I do  and let's just finally return to the first question  What is computer music  And I think that the catch here is that  at least to me  computer music isn't really about computers. It is about people. It's about how we can use technology to change the way we think and do and make music  and maybe even add to how we can connect with each other through music. And with that  I want to say  this is computer music  and thank you for listening. The human voice  It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world  probably. It's the only one that can start a war or say  I love you.  And yet many people have the experience that when they speak  people don't listen to them. And why is that  How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world  What I'd like to suggest  there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list  but these seven  I think  are pretty large habits that we can all fall into. First  gossip. Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. Not a nice habit  and we know perfectly well the person gossiping  five minutes later  will be gossiping about us. Second  judging. We know people who are like this in conversation  and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time. Third  negativity. You can fall into this. My mother  in the last years of her life  became very negative  and it's hard to listen. I remember one day  I said to her   It's October   today   and she said   I know  isn't it dreadful   It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative. And another form of negativity  complaining. Well  this is the national art of the U.K. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather  sport  about politics  about everything  but actually  complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blamethrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions  and again  hard to listen to somebody who is being like that. Penultimate  the sixth of the seven  embroidery  exaggeration. It demeans our language  actually  sometimes. For example  if I see something that really is awesome  what do I call it  And then  of course  this exaggeration becomes lying  and we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us. And finally  dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated  you're listening into the wind. You know  somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are  seven deadly sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive way to think about this  Yes  there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones  foundations  that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world. Fortunately  these things spell a word. The word is  hail   and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition  to greet or acclaim enthusiastically  which is how I think our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for  See if you can guess. The H  honesty  of course  being true in what you say  being straight and clear. The A is authenticity  just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth  which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity  being your word  actually doing what you say  and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love  but I do mean wishing people well  for two reasons. First of all  I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean  my goodness  you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love  of course  honesty is a great thing. But also  if you're really wishing somebody well  it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously. So hail. Also  now that's what you say  and it's like the old song  it is what you say  it's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible  and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with  which will increase the power of your speaking. Register  for example. Now  falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time  but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice  however. So if I talk up here in my nose  you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat  which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight  you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference  We vote for politicians with lower voices  it's true  because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register. Then we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again  the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich  smooth  warm  like hot chocolate. Well if that's not you  that's not the end of the world  because you can train. Go and get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing  with posture  and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice. Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing song  the meta language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word  monotonic  comes from  or monotonous  monotone. Also  we have repetitive prosody now coming in  where every sentence ends as if it were a question when it's actually not a question  it's a statement  And if you repeat that one  it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody  which I think is a shame  so let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very excited by saying something really quickly  or I can slow right down to emphasize  and at the end of that  of course  is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk  is there  We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful. Of course  pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal  but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys  So  slightly different meaning in those two deliveries. And finally  volume. Sorry about that  if I startled anybody. Or  I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting  Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice. Of course  where this all comes into play most of all is when you've got something really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage  asking for a raise  a wedding speech. Whatever it is  if it's really important  you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on  and no engine works well without being warmed up. Warm up your voice. Actually  let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment  I'm going to show you the six vocal warm up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do. Any time you're going to talk to anybody important  do these. First  arms up  deep breath in  and sigh out  ahhhhh  like that. One more time. Ahhhh  very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips  and we're going to go Ba  Ba  Ba  Ba  Ba  Ba  Ba  Ba. Very good. And now  brrrrrrrrrr  just like when you were a kid. Brrrr. Now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la  la  la  la  la  la  la  la  la. Beautiful. You're getting really good at this. And then  roll an R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally  and if I can only do one  the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts with  we  and goes to  aw.  The  we  is high  the  aw  is low. So you go  weeeaawww  weeeaawww. Fantastic. Give yourselves a round of applause. Take a seat  thank you. Next time you speak  do those in advance. Now let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious point here. This is where we are now  right  We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose  Or to make that a bit larger  what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound  That would be a world that does sound beautiful  and one where understanding would be the norm  and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you. This is a lot of ones and zeros. It's what we call binary information. This is how computers talk. It's how they store information. It's how computers think. It's how computers do everything it is that computers do. I'm a cybersecurity researcher  which means my job is to sit down with this information and try to make sense of it  to try to understand what all the ones and zeroes mean. Unfortunately for me  we're not just talking about the ones and zeros I have on the screen here. We're not just talking about a few pages of ones and zeros. We're talking about billions and billions of ones and zeros  more than anyone could possibly comprehend. Now  as exciting as that sounds  when I first started doing cyber   when I first started doing cyber  I wasn't sure that sifting through ones and zeros was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life  because in my mind  cyber was keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer  it was keeping people's Myspace pages from being hacked  and maybe  maybe on my most glorious day  it was keeping someone's credit card information from being stolen. Those are important things  but that's not how I wanted to spend my life. But after    minutes of work as a defense contractor  I soon found out that my idea of cyber was a little bit off. In fact  in terms of national security  keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer was surprisingly low on their priority list. And the reason for that is cyber is so much bigger than any one of those things. Cyber is an integral part of all of our lives  because computers are an integral part of all of our lives  even if you don't own a computer. Computers control everything in your car  from your GPS to your airbags. They control your phone. They're the reason you can call     and get someone on the other line. They control our nation's entire infrastructure. They're the reason you have electricity  heat  clean water  food. Computers control our military equipment  everything from missile silos to satellites to nuclear defense networks. All of these things are made possible because of computers  and therefore because of cyber  and when something goes wrong  cyber can make all of these things impossible. But that's where I step in. A big part of my job is defending all of these things  keeping them working  but once in a while  part of my job is to break one of these things  because cyber isn't just about defense  it's also about offense. We're entering an age where we talk about cyberweapons. In fact  so great is the potential for cyber offense that cyber is considered a new domain of warfare. Warfare. It's not necessarily a bad thing. On the one hand  it means we have whole new front on which we need to defend ourselves  but on the other hand  it means we have a whole new way to attack  a whole new way to stop evil people from doing evil things. So let's consider an example of this that's completely theoretical. Suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building  and he wants to do this again and again in the future. So he doesn't want to be in that building when it explodes. He's going to use a cell phone as a remote detonator. Now  it used to be the only way we had to stop this terrorist was with a hail of bullets and a car chase  but that's not necessarily true anymore. We're entering an age where we can stop him with the press of a button from       miles away  because whether he knew it or not  as soon as he decided to use his cell phone  he stepped into the realm of cyber. A well crafted cyber attack could break into his phone  disable the overvoltage protections on his battery  drastically overload the circuit  cause the battery to overheat  and explode. No more phone  no more detonator  maybe no more terrorist  all with the press of a button from a thousand miles away. So how does this work  It all comes back to those ones and zeros. Binary information makes your phone work  and used correctly  it can make your phone explode. So when you start to look at cyber from this perspective  spending your life sifting through binary information starts to seem kind of exciting. But here's the catch  This is hard  really  really hard  and here's why. Think about everything you have on your cell phone. You've got the pictures you've taken. You've got the music you listen to. You've got your contacts list  your email  and probably     apps you've never used in your entire life  and behind all of this is the software  the code  that controls your phone  and somewhere  buried inside of that code  is a tiny piece that controls your battery  and that's what I'm really after  but all of this  just a bunch of ones and zeros  and it's all just mixed together. In cyber  we call this finding a needle in a stack of needles  because everything pretty much looks alike. I'm looking for one key piece  but it just blends in with everything else. So let's step back from this theoretical situation of making a terrorist's phone explode  and look at something that actually happened to me. Pretty much no matter what I do  my job always starts with sitting down with a whole bunch of binary information  and I'm always looking for one key piece to do something specific. In this case  I was looking for a very advanced  very high tech piece of code that I knew I could hack  but it was somewhere buried inside of a billion ones and zeroes. Unfortunately for me  I didn't know quite what I was looking for. I didn't know quite what it would look like  which makes finding it really  really hard. When I have to do that  what I have to do is basically look at various pieces of this binary information  try to decipher each piece  and see if it might be what I'm after. So after a while  I thought I had found the piece I was looking for. I thought maybe this was it. It seemed to be about right  but I couldn't quite tell. I couldn't tell what those ones and zeros represented. So I spent some time trying to put this together  but wasn't having a whole lot of luck  and finally I decided  I'm going to get through this  I'm going to come in on a weekend  and I'm not going to leave until I figure out what this represents. So that's what I did. I came in on a Saturday morning  and about    hours in  I sort of had all the pieces to the puzzle. I just didn't know how they fit together. I didn't know what these ones and zeros meant. At the    hour mark  I started to get a better picture of what was there  but I had a creeping suspicion that what I was looking at was not at all related to what I was looking for. By    hours  the pieces started to come together very slowly    Laughter    and I was pretty sure I was going down the wrong path at this point  but I wasn't going to give up. After    hours in the lab  I figured out exactly what I was looking at  and I was right  it wasn't what I was looking for. I spent    hours piecing together the ones and zeros that formed a picture of a kitten. I wasted    hours of my life searching for this kitten that had nothing at all to do with what I was trying to accomplish. So I was frustrated  I was exhausted. After    hours in the lab  I probably smelled horrible. But instead of just going home and calling it quits  I took a step back and asked myself  what went wrong here  How could I make such a stupid mistake  I'm really pretty good at this. I do this for a living. So what happened  Well I thought  when you're looking at information at this level  it's so easy to lose track of what you're doing. It's easy to not see the forest through the trees. It's easy to go down the wrong rabbit hole and waste a tremendous amount of time doing the wrong thing. But I had this epiphany. We were looking at the data completely incorrectly since day one. This is how computers think  ones and zeros. It's not how people think  but we've been trying to adapt our minds to think more like computers so that we can understand this information. Instead of trying to make our minds fit the problem  we should have been making the problem fit our minds  because our brains have a tremendous potential for analyzing huge amounts of information  just not like this. So what if we could unlock that potential just by translating this to the right kind of information  So with these ideas in mind  I sprinted out of my basement lab at work to my basement lab at home  which looked pretty much the same. The main difference is  at work  I'm surrounded by cyber materials  and cyber seemed to be the problem in this situation. At home  I'm surrounded by everything else I've ever learned. So I poured through every book I could find  every idea I'd ever encountered  to see how could we translate a problem from one domain to something completely different  The biggest question was  what do we want to translate it to  What do our brains do perfectly naturally that we could exploit  My answer was vision. We have a tremendous capability to analyze visual information. We can combine color gradients  depth cues  all sorts of these different signals into one coherent picture of the world around us. That's incredible. So if we could find a way to translate these binary patterns to visual signals  we could really unlock the power of our brains to process this stuff. So I started looking at the binary information  and I asked myself  what do I do when I first encounter something like this  And the very first thing I want to do  the very first question I want to answer  is what is this  I don't care what it does  how it works. All I want to know is  what is this  And the way I can figure that out is by looking at chunks  sequential chunks of binary information  and I look at the relationships between those chunks. When I gather up enough of these sequences  I begin to get an idea of exactly what this information must be. So let's go back to that blow up the terrorist's phone situation. This is what English text looks like at a binary level. This is what your contacts list would look like if I were examining it. It's really hard to analyze this at this level  but if we take those same binary chunks that I would be trying to find  and instead translate that to a visual representation  translate those relationships  this is what we get. This is what English text looks like from a visual abstraction perspective. All of a sudden  it shows us all the same information that was in the ones and zeros  but show us it in an entirely different way  a way that we can immediately comprehend. We can instantly see all of the patterns here. It takes me seconds to pick out patterns here  but hours  days  to pick them out in ones and zeros. It takes minutes for anybody to learn what these patterns represent here  but years of experience in cyber to learn what those same patterns represent in ones and zeros. So this piece is caused by lower case letters followed by lower case letters inside of that contact list. This is upper case by upper case  upper case by lower case  lower case by upper case. This is caused by spaces. This is caused by carriage returns. We can go through every little detail of the binary information in seconds  as opposed to weeks  months  at this level. This is what an image looks like from your cell phone. But this is what it looks like in a visual abstraction. This is what your music looks like  but here's its visual abstraction. Most importantly for me  this is what the code on your cell phone looks like. This is what I'm after in the end  but this is its visual abstraction. If I can find this  I can't make the phone explode. I could spend weeks trying to find this in ones and zeros  but it takes me seconds to pick out a visual abstraction like this. One of those most remarkable parts about all of this is it gives us an entirely new way to understand new information  stuff that we haven't seen before. So I know what English looks like at a binary level  and I know what its visual abstraction looks like  but I've never seen Russian binary in my entire life. It would take me weeks just to figure out what I was looking at from raw ones and zeros  but because our brains can instantly pick up and recognize these subtle patterns inside of these visual abstractions  we can unconsciously apply those in new situations. So this is what Russian looks like in a visual abstraction. Because I know what one language looks like  I can recognize other languages even when I'm not familiar with them. This is what a photograph looks like  but this is what clip art looks like. This is what the code on your phone looks like  but this is what the code on your computer looks like. Our brains can pick up on these patterns in ways that we never could have from looking at raw ones and zeros. But we've really only scratched the surface of what we can do with this approach. We've only begun to unlock the capabilities of our minds to process visual information. If we take those same concepts and translate them into three dimensions instead  we find entirely new ways of making sense of information. In seconds  we can pick out every pattern here. we can see the cross associated with code. We can see cubes associated with text. We can even pick up the tiniest visual artifacts. Things that would take us weeks  months to find in ones and zeroes  are immediately apparent in some sort of visual abstraction  and as we continue to go through this and throw more and more information at it  what we find is that we're capable of processing billions of ones and zeros in a matter of seconds just by using our brain's built in ability to analyze patterns. So this is really nice and helpful  but all this tells me is what I'm looking at. So at this point  based on visual patterns  I can find the code on the phone. But that's not enough to blow up a battery. The next thing I need to find is the code that controls the battery  but we're back to the needle in a stack of needles problem. That code looks pretty much like all the other code on that system. So I might not be able to find the code that controls the battery  but there's a lot of things that are very similar to that. You have code that controls your screen  that controls your buttons  that controls your microphones  so even if I can't find the code for the battery  I bet I can find one of those things. So the next step in my binary analysis process is to look at pieces of information that are similar to each other. It's really  really hard to do at a binary level  but if we translate those similarities to a visual abstraction instead  I don't even have to sift through the raw data. All I have to do is wait for the image to light up to see when I'm at similar pieces. I follow these strands of similarity like a trail of bread crumbs to find exactly what I'm looking for. So at this point in the process  I've located the code responsible for controlling your battery  but that's still not enough to blow up a phone. The last piece of the puzzle is understanding how that code controls your battery. For this  I need to identify very subtle  very detailed relationships within that binary information  another very hard thing to do when looking at ones and zeros. But if we translate that information into a physical representation  we can sit back and let our visual cortex do all the hard work. It can find all the detailed patterns  all the important pieces  for us. It can find out exactly how the pieces of that code work together to control that battery. All of this can be done in a matter of hours  whereas the same process would have taken months in the past. This is all well and good in a theoretical blow up a terrorist's phone situation. I wanted to find out if this would really work in the work I do every day. So I was playing around with these same concepts with some of the data I've looked at in the past  and yet again  I was trying to find a very detailed  specific piece of code inside of a massive piece of binary information. So I looked at it at this level  thinking I was looking at the right thing  only to see this doesn't have the connectivity I would have expected for the code I was looking for. In fact  I'm not really sure what this is  but when I stepped back a level and looked at the similarities within the code I saw  this doesn't have similarities like any code that exists out there. I can't even be looking at code. In fact  from this perspective  I could tell  this isn't code. This is an image of some sort. And from here  I can see  it's not just an image  this is a photograph. Now that I know it's a photograph  I've got dozens of other binary translation techniques to visualize and understand that information  so in a matter of seconds  we can take this information  shove it through a dozen other visual translation techniques in order to find out exactly what we were looking at. I saw    Laughter    it was that darn kitten again. All this is enabled because we were able to find a way to translate a very hard problem to something our brains do very naturally. So what does this mean  Well  for kittens  it means no more hiding in ones and zeros. For me  it means no more wasted weekends. For cyber  it means we have a radical new way to tackle the most impossible problems. It means we have a new weapon in the evolving theater of cyber warfare  but for all of us  it means that cyber engineers now have the ability to become first responders in emergency situations. When seconds count  we've unlocked the means to stop the bad guys. Thank you. As a scientist  and also as a human being  I've been trying to make myself susceptible to wonder. I think Jason Webley last night called it  conspiring to be part of the magic.  So it's fortunate that my career as a biologist lets me dive deeply into the lives of some truly wondrous creatures that share our planet  fireflies. Now  for many of you  I know that fireflies might conjure up some really great memories  childhood  summertime  even other TED Talks. Maybe something like this. My seduction into the world of fireflies began when I was back in graduate school. One evening  I was sitting out in my backyard in North Carolina  and suddenly  these silent sparks rose up all around me  and I began to wonder  How do these creatures make light  and what's with all this flashing  Are they talking to one another  And what happens after the lights go out  I've been lucky enough to answer some of these questions as I've explored this nocturnal world. Now if you've ever seen or even heard about fireflies  then you'll know how magically they can transform our everyday landscape into something ethereal and otherworldly  and this happens around the globe  like this hillside in the Smoky Mountains that I saw transformed into a living cascade of light by the eerie glows of these blue ghost fireflies  or a roadside river that I visited in Japan as it was giving birth to the slow  floating flashes of these Genji fireflies  or in Malaysia  the mangrove trees that I watched blossom nightly not with flowers but with the lights of a thousand     Bleep  Bleep     fireflies  all blinking together in stunning synchrony. These luminous landscapes still fill me with wonder  and they keep me connected to the magic of the natural world. And I find it amazing that they're created by these tiny insects. In person  fireflies are charming. They're charismatic. They've been celebrated in art and in poetry for centuries. As I've traveled around the world  I've met many thoughtful people who have told me that God put fireflies on Earth for humans to enjoy. Other creatures can enjoy them too. I think these graceful insects are truly miraculous because they so beautifully illuminate the creative improvisation of evolution. They've been shaped by two powerful evolutionary forces  natural selection  the struggle for survival  and sexual selection  the struggle for reproductive opportunity. As a firefly junkie  the past    years have been quite an exciting ride. Together with my students at Tufts University and other colleagues  we've made lots of new discoveries about fireflies  their courtship and sex lives  their treachery and murder. So today I'd like to share with you just a couple of tales that we've brought back from our collective adventures into this hidden world. Fireflies belong to a very beautiful and diverse group of insects  the beetles. Worldwide  there are more than       firefly species  and these have evolved remarkably diverse courtship signals  that is  different ways to find and attract mates. Around     million years ago  the very first fireflies probably looked like this. They flew during the daytime and they didn't light up. Instead  males used their fantastic antennae to sniff out perfumes given off by their females. In other fireflies  it's only the females who light up. They are attractively plump and wingless  so every night  they climb up onto perches and they glow brightly for hours to attract their flying but unlit males. In still other fireflies  both sexes use quick  bright flashes to find their mates. Here in North America  we have more than     different kinds of firefly that have the remarkable ability to shine energy out from their bodies in the form of light. How do they do that  It seems totally magical  but these bioluminescent signals arise from carefully orchestrated chemical reactions that happen inside the firefly lantern. The main star is an enzyme called luciferase  which in the course of evolution has figured out a way to wrap its tiny arms around an even smaller molecule called luciferin  in the process getting it so excited that it actually gives off light. Incredible. But how could these bright lights have benefited some proto firefly  To answer this question  we need to flip back in the family album to some baby pictures. Fireflies completely reinvent their bodies as they grow. They spend the vast majority of their lifetime  up to two years  in this larval form. Their main goal here  like my teenagers  is to eat and grow. And firefly light first originated in these juveniles. Every single firefly larva can light up  even when their adults can't. But what's the point to being so conspicuous  Well  we know that these juveniles make nasty tasting chemicals that help them survive their extended childhood  so we think these lights first evolved as a warning  a neon sign that says   Toxic  Stay away   to any would be predators. It took many millions of years before these bright lights evolved into a smart communication tool that could be used not just to ward off potential predators but to bring in potential mates. Driven now by sexual selection  some adult fireflies like this proud male evolved a shiny new glow in the dark lantern that would let them take courtship to a whole new level. These adults only live a few weeks  and now they're single mindedly focused on sex  that is  on propelling their genes into the next firefly generation. So we can follow this male out into the field as he joins hundreds of other males who are all showing off their new courtship signals. It's amazing to think that the luminous displays we admire here and in fact everywhere around the world are actually the silent love songs of male fireflies. They're flying and flashing their hearts out. I still find it very romantic. But meanwhile  where are all the females  Well  they're lounging down below surveying their options. They have plenty of males to choose from  and these females turn out to be very picky. When a female sees a flash from an especially attractive male  she'll aim her lantern in his direction  and give him a flash back. It's her  come hither  sign. So he flies closer and he flashes again. If she still likes him  they'll strike up a conversation. These creatures speak their love in the language of light. So what exactly do these females consider sexy  We decided to conduct some firefly opinion polls to find out. When we tested females using blinking LED lights  we discovered they prefer males who give longer lasting flashes. I know you're wondering  what gives these males their sex appeal  Now we get to see what happens when the lights go out. The first thing we discovered is that once a male and female hook up like this  they stay together all night long  and when we looked inside to see what might be happening  we discovered a surprising new twist to firefly sex. While they're mating  the male is busy giving the female not just his sperm but also a nutrient filled package called a nuptial gift. We can zoom in to look more closely inside this mating pair. We can actually see the gift   it's shown here in red   as it's being passed from the male to the female. What makes this gift so valuable is that it's packed with protein that the female will use to provision her eggs. So females are keeping their eyes on this prize as they size up potential mates. We discovered that females use male flash signals to try to predict which males have the biggest gifts to offer  because this bling helps the female lay more eggs and ultimately launch more of her own offspring into the next generation. So it's not all sweetness and light. Firefly romance is risky. For the most part  these adult fireflies don't get eaten because like their juveniles they can manufacture toxins that are repellent to birds and other insectivores  but somewhere along the line  one particular group of fireflies somehow lost the metabolic machinery needed to make their own protective toxins. This evolutionary flaw  which was discovered by my colleague Tom Eisner  has driven these fireflies to take their bright lights out into the night with treacherous intent. Dubbed  femme fatales  by Jim Lloyd  another colleague  these females have figured out how to target the males of other firefly species. So the hunt begins with the predator   she's shown here in the lower left   where she's sitting quietly and eavesdropping on the courtship conversation of her intended prey  and here's how it might go. First the prey male flashes   Do you love me   His own female responds   Maybe.  So then he flashes again. But this time  the predator sneaks in a reply that cleverly mimics exactly what the other female just said. She's not looking for love  she's looking for toxins. If she's good  she can lure this male close enough to reach out and grab him  and he's not just a light snack. Over the next hour  she slowly exsanguinates this male leaving behind just some gory remains. Unable to make their own toxins  these females resort to drinking the blood of other fireflies to get these protective chemicals. So a firefly vampire  brought to you by natural selection. We still have a lot to learn about fireflies  but it looks like many stories will remain untold  because around the world  firefly populations are blinking out. The main culprit  habitat loss. Pretty much everywhere  the fields and forests  the mangroves and meadows that fireflies need to survive  are giving way to development and to sprawl. Here's another problem  we've conquered darkness  but in the process  we spill so much extra light out into the night that it disrupts the lives of other creatures  and fireflies are especially sensitive to light pollution because it obscures the signals that they use to find their mates. Do we really need fireflies  After all  they're just one tiny bit of Earth's biodiversity. Yet every time a species is lost  it's like extinguishing a room full of candles one by one. You might not notice when the first few flames flicker out  but in the end  you're left sitting in darkness. As we work together to craft a planetary future  I hope we can find a way to keep these bright lights shining. Thank you. I've been thinking a lot about the world recently and how it's changed over the last            years. Twenty or    years ago  if a chicken caught a cold and sneezed and died in a remote village in East Asia  it would have been a tragedy for the chicken and its closest relatives  but I don't think there was much possibility of us fearing a global pandemic and the deaths of millions. Twenty or    years ago  if a bank in North America lent too much money to some people who couldn't afford to pay it back and the bank went bust  that was bad for the lender and bad for the borrower  but we didn't imagine it would bring the global economic system to its knees for nearly a decade. This is globalization. This is the miracle that has enabled us to transship our bodies and our minds and our words and our pictures and our ideas and our teaching and our learning around the planet ever faster and ever cheaper. It's brought a lot of bad stuff  like the stuff that I just described  but it's also brought a lot of good stuff. A lot of us are not aware of the extraordinary successes of the Millennium Development Goals  several of which have achieved their targets long before the due date. That proves that this species of humanity is capable of achieving extraordinary progress if it really acts together and it really tries hard. But if I had to put it in a nutshell these days  I sort of feel that globalization has taken us by surprise  and we've been slow to respond to it. If you look at the downside of globalization  it really does seem to be sometimes overwhelming. All of the grand challenges that we face today  like climate change and human rights and demographics and terrorism and pandemics and narco trafficking and human slavery and species loss  I could go on  we're not making an awful lot of progress against an awful lot of those challenges. So in a nutshell  that's the challenge that we all face today at this interesting point in history. That's clearly what we've got to do next. We've somehow got to get our act together and we've got to figure out how to globalize the solutions better so that we don't simply become a species which is the victim of the globalization of problems. Why are we so slow at achieving these advances  What's the reason for it  Well  there are  of course  a number of reasons  but perhaps the primary reason is because we're still organized as a species in the same way that we were organized     or     years ago. There's one superpower left on the planet and that is the seven billion people  the seven billion of us who cause all these problems  the same seven billion  by the way  who will resolve them all. But how are those seven billion organized  They're still organized in     or so nation states  and the nations have governments that make rules and cause us to behave in certain ways. And that's a pretty efficient system  but the problem is that the way that those laws are made and the way those governments think is absolutely wrong for the solution of global problems  because it all looks inwards. The politicians that we elect and the politicians we don't elect  on the whole  have minds that microscope. They don't have minds that telescope. They look in. They pretend  they behave  as if they believed that every country was an island that existed quite happily  independently of all the others on its own little planet in its own little solar system. This is the problem  countries competing against each other  countries fighting against each other. This week  as any week you care to look at  you'll find people actually trying to kill each other from country to country  but even when that's not going on  there's competition between countries  each one trying to shaft the next. This is clearly not a good arrangement. We clearly need to change it. We clearly need to find ways of encouraging countries to start working together a little bit better. And why won't they do that  Why is it that our leaders still persist in looking inwards  Well  the first and most obvious reason is because that's what we ask them to do. That's what we tell them to do. When we elect governments or when we tolerate unelected governments  we're effectively telling them that what we want is for them to deliver us in our country a certain number of things. We want them to deliver prosperity  growth  competitiveness  transparency  justice and all of those things. So unless we start asking our governments to think outside a little bit  to consider the global problems that will finish us all if we don't start considering them  then we can hardly blame them if what they carry on doing is looking inwards  if they still have minds that microscope rather than minds that telescope. That's the first reason why things tend not to change. The second reason is that these governments  just like all the rest of us  are cultural psychopaths. I don't mean to be rude  but you know what a psychopath is. A psychopath is a person who  unfortunately for him or her  lacks the ability to really empathize with other human beings. When they look around  they don't see other human beings with deep  rich  three dimensional personal lives and aims and ambitions. What they see is cardboard cutouts  and it's very sad and it's very lonely  and it's very rare  fortunately. But actually  aren't most of us not really so very good at empathy  Oh sure  we're very good at empathy when it's a question of dealing with people who kind of look like us and kind of walk and talk and eat and pray and wear like us  but when it comes to people who don't do that  who don't quite dress like us and don't quite pray like us and don't quite talk like us  do we not also have a tendency to see them ever so slightly as cardboard cutouts too  And this is a question we need to ask ourselves. I think constantly we have to monitor it. Are we and our politicians to a degree cultural psychopaths  The third reason is hardly worth mentioning because it's so silly  but there's a belief amongst governments that the domestic agenda and the international agenda are incompatible and always will be. This is just nonsense. In my day job  I'm a policy adviser. I've spent the last    years or so advising governments around the world  and in all of that time I have never once seen a single domestic policy issue that could not be more imaginatively  effectively and rapidly resolved than by treating it as an international problem  looking at the international context  comparing what others have done  bringing in others  working externally instead of working internally. And so you may say  well  given all of that  why then doesn't it work  Why can we not make our politicians change  Why can't we demand them  Well I  like a lot of us  spend a lot of time complaining about how hard it is to make people change  and I don't think we should fuss about it. I think we should just accept that we are an inherently conservative species. We don't like to change. It exists for very sensible evolutionary reasons. We probably wouldn't still be here today if we weren't so resistant to change. It's very simple  Many thousands of years ago  we discovered that if we carried on doing the same things  we wouldn't die  because the things that we've done before by definition didn't kill us  and therefore as long as we carry on doing them  we'll be okay  and it's very sensible not to do anything new  because it might kill you. But of course  there are exceptions to that. Otherwise  we'd never get anywhere. And one of the exceptions  the interesting exception  is when you can show to people that there might be some self interest in them making that leap of faith and changing a little bit. So I've spent a lot of the last    or    years trying to find out what could be that self interest that would encourage not just politicians but also businesses and general populations  all of us  to start to think a little more outwardly  to think in a bigger picture  not always to look inwards  sometimes to look outwards. And this is where I discovered something quite important. In       I launched a study called the Nation Brands Index. What it is  it's a very large scale study that polls a very large sample of the world's population  a sample that represents about    percent of the planet's population  and I started asking them a series of questions about how they perceive other countries. And the Nation Brands Index over the years has grown to be a very  very large database. It's about     billion data points tracking what ordinary people think about other countries and why. Why did I do this  Well  because the governments that I advise are very  very keen on knowing how they are regarded. They've known  partly because I've encouraged them to realize it  that countries depend enormously on their reputations in order to survive and prosper in the world. If a country has a great  positive image  like Germany has or Sweden or Switzerland  everything is easy and everything is cheap. You get more tourists. You get more investors. You sell your products more expensively. If  on the other hand  you have a country with a very weak or a very negative image  everything is difficult and everything is expensive. So governments care desperately about the image of their country  because it makes a direct difference to how much money they can make  and that's what they've promised their populations they're going to deliver. So a couple of years ago  I thought I would take some time out and speak to that gigantic database and ask it  why do some people prefer one country more than another  And the answer that the database gave me completely staggered me. It was  . . I haven't got time to explain in detail. Basically what it told me was   the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries. We don't admire countries primarily because they're rich  because they're powerful  because they're successful  because they're modern  because they're technologically advanced. We primarily admire countries that are good. What do we mean by good  We mean countries that seem to contribute something to the world in which we live  countries that actually make the world safer or better or richer or fairer. Those are the countries we like. This is a discovery of significant importance   you see where I'm going   because it squares the circle. I can now say  and often do  to any government  in order to do well  you need to do good. If you want to sell more products  if you want to get more investment  if you want to become more competitive  then you need to start behaving  because that's why people will respect you and do business with you  and therefore  the more you collaborate  the more competitive you become. This is quite an important discovery  and as soon as I discovered this  I felt another index coming on. I swear that as I get older  my ideas become simpler and more and more childish. This one is called the Good Country Index  and it does exactly what it says on the tin. It measures  or at least it tries to measure  exactly how much each country on Earth contributes not to its own population but to the rest of humanity. Bizarrely  nobody had ever thought of measuring this before. So my colleague Dr. Robert Govers and I have spent the best part of the last two years  with the help of a large number of very serious and clever people  cramming together all the reliable data in the world we could find about what countries give to the world. And you're waiting for me to tell you which one comes top. And I'm going to tell you  but first of all I want to tell you precisely what I mean when I say a good country. I do not mean morally good. When I say that Country X is the goodest country on Earth  and I mean goodest  I don't mean best. Best is something different. When you're talking about a good country  you can be good  gooder and goodest. It's not the same thing as good  better and best. This is a country which simply gives more to humanity than any other country. I don't talk about how they behave at home because that's measured elsewhere. And the winner is Ireland. According to the data here  no country on Earth  per head of population  per dollar of GDP  contributes more to the world that we live in than Ireland. What does this mean  This means that as we go to sleep at night  all of us in the last    seconds before we drift off to sleep  our final thought should be  godammit  I'm glad that Ireland exists. And that    Applause    In the depths of a very severe economic recession  I think that there's a really important lesson there  that if you can remember your international obligations whilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy  that's really something. Finland ranks pretty much the same. The only reason why it's below Ireland is because its lowest score is lower than Ireland's lowest score. Now the other thing you'll notice about the top    there is  of course  they're all  apart from New Zealand  Western European nations. They're also all rich. This depressed me  because one of the things that I did not want to discover with this index is that it's purely the province of rich countries to help poor countries. This is not what it's all about. And indeed  if you look further down the list  I don't have the slide here  you will see something that made me very happy indeed  that Kenya is in the top     and that demonstrates one very  very important thing. This is not about money. This is about attitude. This is about culture. This is about a government and a people that care about the rest of the world and have the imagination and the courage to think outwards instead of only thinking selfishly. I'm going to whip through the other slides just so you can see some of the lower lying countries. There's Germany at   th  the U.S. comes   st  Mexico comes   th  and then we have some of the big developing countries  like Russia at   th  China at    th. Countries like China and Russia and India  which is down in the same part of the index  well  in some ways  it's not surprising. They've spent a great deal of time over the last decades building their own economy  building their own society and their own polity  but it is to be hoped that the second phase of their growth will be somewhat more outward looking than the first phase has been so far. And then you can break down each country in terms of the actual datasets that build into it. I'll allow you to do that. From midnight tonight it's going to be on goodcountry.org  and you can look at the country. You can look right down to the level of the individual datasets. Now that's the Good Country Index. What's it there for  Well  it's there really because I want to try to introduce this word  or reintroduce this word  into the discourse. I've had enough hearing about competitive countries. I've had enough hearing about prosperous  wealthy  fast growing countries. I've even had enough hearing about happy countries because in the end that's still selfish. That's still about us  and if we carry on thinking about us  we are in deep  deep trouble. I think we all know what it is that we want to hear about. We want to hear about good countries  and so I want to ask you all a favor. I'm not asking a lot. It's something that you might find easy to do and you might even find enjoyable and even helpful to do  and that's simply to start using the word  good  in this context. When you think about your own country  when you think about other people's countries  when you think about companies  when you talk about the world that we live in today  start using that word in the way that I've talked about this evening. Not good  the opposite of bad  because that's an argument that never finishes. Good  the opposite of selfish  good being a country that thinks about all of us. That's what I would like you to do  and I'd like you to use it as a stick with which to beat your politicians. When you elect them  when you reelect them  when you vote for them  when you listen to what they're offering you  use that word   good   and ask yourself   Is that what a good country would do   And if the answer is no  be very suspicious. Ask yourself  is that the behavior of my country  Do I want to come from a country where the government  in my name  is doing things like that  Or do I  on the other hand  prefer the idea of walking around the world with my head held high thinking   Yeah  I'm proud to come from a good country   And everybody will welcome you. And everybody in the last    seconds before they drift off to sleep at night will say   Gosh  I'm glad that person's country exists.  Ultimately  that  I think  is what will make the change. That word   good   and the number  .  and the discovery that's behind it have changed my life. I think they can change your life  and I think we can use it to change the way that our politicians and our companies behave  and in doing so  we can change the world. I've started thinking very differently about my own country since I've been thinking about these things. I used to think that I wanted to live in a rich country  and then I started thinking I wanted to live in a happy country  but I began to realize  it's not enough. I don't want to live in a rich country. I don't want to live in a fast growing or competitive country. I want to live in a good country  and I so  so hope that you do too. Thank you. When we think about prejudice and bias  we tend to think about stupid and evil people doing stupid and evil things. And this idea is nicely summarized by the British critic William Hazlitt  who wrote   Prejudice is the child of ignorance.  I want to try to convince you here that this is mistaken. I want to try to convince you that prejudice and bias are natural  they're often rational  and they're often even moral  and I think that once we understand this  we're in a better position to make sense of them when they go wrong  when they have horrible consequences  and we're in a better position to know what to do when this happens. So  start with stereotypes. You look at me  you know my name  you know certain facts about me  and you could make certain judgments. You could make guesses about my ethnicity  my political affiliation  my religious beliefs. And the thing is  these judgments tend to be accurate. We're very good at this sort of thing. And we're very good at this sort of thing because our ability to stereotype people is not some sort of arbitrary quirk of the mind  but rather it's a specific instance of a more general process  which is that we have experience with things and people in the world that fall into categories  and we can use our experience to make generalizations about novel instances of these categories. So everybody here has a lot of experience with chairs and apples and dogs  and based on this  you could see unfamiliar examples and you could guess  you could sit on the chair  you could eat the apple  the dog will bark. Now we might be wrong. The chair could collapse if you sit on it  the apple might be poison  the dog might not bark  and in fact  this is my dog Tessie  who doesn't bark. But for the most part  we're good at this. For the most part  we make good guesses both in the social domain and the non social domain  and if we weren't able to do so  if we weren't able to make guesses about new instances that we encounter  we wouldn't survive. And in fact  Hazlitt later on in his wonderful essay concedes this. He writes   Without the aid of prejudice and custom  I should not be able to find my way my across the room  nor know how to conduct myself in any circumstances  nor what to feel in any relation of life.  Or take bias. Now sometimes  we break the world up into us versus them  into in group versus out group  and sometimes when we do this  we know we're doing something wrong  and we're kind of ashamed of it. But other times we're proud of it. We openly acknowledge it. And my favorite example of this is a question that came from the audience in a Republican debate prior to the last election. the question in the hall  on foreign aid  Yes  ma'am. Woman  The American people are suffering in our country right now. Why do we continue to send foreign aid to other countries when we need all the help we can get for ourselves  AC  Governor Perry  what about that  Rick Perry  Absolutely  I think it's  Paul Bloom  Each of the people onstage agreed with the premise of her question  which is as Americans  we should care more about Americans than about other people. And in fact  in general  people are often swayed by feelings of solidarity  loyalty  pride  patriotism  towards their country or towards their ethnic group. Regardless of your politics  many people feel proud to be American  and they favor Americans over other countries. Residents of other countries feel the same about their nation  and we feel the same about our ethnicities. Now some of you may reject this. Some of you may be so cosmopolitan that you think that ethnicity and nationality should hold no moral sway. But even you sophisticates accept that there should be some pull towards the in group in the domain of friends and family  of people you're close to  and so even you make a distinction between us versus them. Now  this distinction is natural enough and often moral enough  but it can go awry  and this was part of the research of the great social psychologist Henri Tajfel. Tajfel was born in Poland in     . He left to go to university in France  because as a Jew  he couldn't go to university in Poland  and then he enlisted in the French military in World War II. He was captured and ended up in a prisoner of war camp  and it was a terrifying time for him  because if it was discovered that he was a Jew  he could have been moved to a concentration camp  where he most likely would not have survived. And in fact  when the war ended and he was released  most of his friends and family were dead. He got involved in different pursuits. He helped out the war orphans. But he had a long lasting interest in the science of prejudice  and so when a prestigious British scholarship on stereotypes opened up  he applied for it  and he won it  and then he began this amazing career. And what started his career is an insight that the way most people were thinking about the Holocaust was wrong. Many people  most people at the time  viewed the Holocaust as sort of representing some tragic flaw on the part of the Germans  some genetic taint  some authoritarian personality. And Tajfel rejected this. Tajfel said what we see in the Holocaust is just an exaggeration of normal psychological processes that exist in every one of us. And to explore this  he did a series of classic studies with British adolescents. And in one of his studies  what he did was he asked the British adolescents all sorts of questions  and then based on their answers  he said   I've looked at your answers  and based on the answers  I have determined that you are either    he told half of them    a Kandinsky lover  you love the work of Kandinsky  or a Klee lover  you love the work of Klee.  It was entirely bogus. Their answers had nothing to do with Kandinsky or Klee. They probably hadn't heard of the artists. He just arbitrarily divided them up. But what he found was  these categories mattered  so when he later gave the subjects money  they would prefer to give the money to members of their own group than members of the other group. Worse  they were actually most interested in establishing a difference between their group and other groups  so they would give up money for their own group if by doing so they could give the other group even less. This bias seems to show up very early. So my colleague and wife  Karen Wynn  at Yale has done a series of studies with babies where she exposes babies to puppets  and the puppets have certain food preferences. So one of the puppets might like green beans. The other puppet might like graham crackers. They test the babies own food preferences  and babies typically prefer the graham crackers. But the question is  does this matter to babies in how they treat the puppets  And it matters a lot. They tend to prefer the puppet who has the same food tastes that they have  and worse  they actually prefer puppets who punish the puppet with the different food taste. We see this sort of in group  out group psychology all the time. We see it in political clashes within groups with different ideologies. We see it in its extreme in cases of war  where the out group isn't merely given less  but dehumanized  as in the Nazi perspective of Jews as vermin or lice  or the American perspective of Japanese as rats. Stereotypes can also go awry. So often they're rational and useful  but sometimes they're irrational  they give the wrong answers  and other times they lead to plainly immoral consequences. And the case that's been most studied is the case of race. There was a fascinating study prior to the      election where social psychologists looked at the extent to which the candidates were associated with America  as in an unconscious association with the American flag. And in one of their studies they compared Obama and McCain  and they found McCain is thought of as more American than Obama  and to some extent  people aren't  that surprised by hearing that. McCain is a celebrated war hero  and many people would explicitly say he has more of an American story than Obama. But they also compared Obama to British Prime Minister Tony Blair  and they found that Blair was also thought of as more American than Obama  even though subjects explicitly understood that he's not American at all. But they were responding  of course  to the color of his skin. These stereotypes and biases have real world consequences  both subtle and very important. In one recent study  researchers put ads on eBay for the sale of baseball cards. Some of them were held by white hands  others by black hands. They were the same baseball cards. The ones held by black hands got substantially smaller bids than the ones held by white hands. In research done at Stanford  psychologists explored the case of people sentenced for the murder of a white person. It turns out  holding everything else constant  you are considerably more likely to be executed if you look like the man on the right than the man on the left  and this is in large part because the man on the right looks more prototypically black  more prototypically African American  and this apparently influences people's decisions over what to do about him. So now that we know about this  how do we combat it  And there are different avenues. One avenue is to appeal to people's emotional responses  to appeal to people's empathy  and we often do that through stories. So if you are a liberal parent and you want to encourage your children to believe in the merits of nontraditional families  you might give them a book like this.   Heather Has Two Mommies   If you are conservative and have a different attitude  you might give them a book like this. But in general  stories can turn anonymous strangers into people who matter  and the idea that we care about people when we focus on them as individuals is an idea which has shown up across history. So Stalin apocryphally said   A single death is a tragedy  a million deaths is a statistic   and Mother Teresa said   If I look at the mass  I will never act. If I look at the one  I will.  Psychologists have explored this. For instance  in one study  people were given a list of facts about a crisis  and it was seen how much they would donate to solve this crisis  and another group was given no facts at all but they were told of an individual and given a name and given a face  and it turns out that they gave far more. None of this I think is a secret to the people who are engaged in charity work. People don't tend to deluge people with facts and statistics. Rather  you show them faces  you show them people. It's possible that by extending our sympathies to an individual  they can spread to the group that the individual belongs to. This is Harriet Beecher Stowe. The story  perhaps apocryphal  is that President Lincoln invited her to the White House in the middle of the Civil War and said to her   So you're the little lady who started this great war.  And he was talking about  Uncle Tom's Cabin.   Uncle Tom's Cabin  is not a great book of philosophy or of theology or perhaps not even literature  but it does a great job of getting people to put themselves in the shoes of people they wouldn't otherwise be in the shoes of  put themselves in the shoes of slaves. And that could well have been a catalyst for great social change. More recently  looking at America in the last several decades  there's some reason to believe that shows like  The Cosby Show  radically changed American attitudes towards African Americans  while shows like  Will and Grace  and  Modern Family  changed American attitudes towards gay men and women. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the major catalyst in America for moral change has been a situation comedy. But it's not all emotions  and I want to end by appealing to the power of reason. At some point in his wonderful book  The Better Angels of Our Nature   Steven Pinker says  the Old Testament says love thy neighbor  and the New Testament says love thy enemy  but I don't love either one of them  not really  but I don't want to kill them. I know I have obligations to them  but my moral feelings to them  my moral beliefs about how I should behave towards them  aren't grounded in love. What they're grounded in is the understanding of human rights  a belief that their life is as valuable to them as my life is to me  and to support this  he tells a story by the great philosopher Adam Smith  and I want to tell this story too  though I'm going to modify it a little bit for modern times. So Adam Smith starts by asking you to imagine the death of thousands of people  and imagine that the thousands of people are in a country you are not familiar with. It could be China or India or a country in Africa. And Smith says  how would you respond  And you would say  well that's too bad  and you'd go on to the rest of your life. If you were to open up The New York Times online or something  and discover this  and in fact this happens to us all the time  we go about our lives. But imagine instead  Smith says  you were to learn that tomorrow you were to have your little finger chopped off. Smith says  that would matter a lot. You would not sleep that night wondering about that. So this raises the question  Would you sacrifice thousands of lives to save your little finger  Now answer this in the privacy of your own head  but Smith says  absolutely not  what a horrid thought. And so this raises the question  and so  as Smith puts it   When our passive feelings are almost always so sordid and so selfish  how comes it that our active principles should often be so generous and so noble   And Smith's answer is   It is reason  principle  conscience.  This  calls to us  with a voice capable of astonishing the most presumptuous of our passions  that we are but one of the multitude  in no respect better than any other in it.  And this last part is what is often described as the principle of impartiality. And this principle of impartiality manifests itself in all of the world's religions  in all of the different versions of the golden rule  and in all of the world's moral philosophies  which differ in many ways but share the presupposition that we should judge morality from sort of an impartial point of view. The best articulation of this view is actually  for me  it's not from a theologian or from a philosopher  but from Humphrey Bogart at the end of  Casablanca.  So  spoiler alert  he's telling his lover that they have to separate for the more general good  and he says to her  and I won't do the accent  but he says to her   It doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.  Our reason could cause us to override our passions. Our reason could motivate us to extend our empathy  could motivate us to write a book like  Uncle Tom's Cabin   or read a book like  Uncle Tom's Cabin   and our reason can motivate us to create customs and taboos and laws that will constrain us from acting upon our impulses when  as rational beings  we feel we should be constrained. This is what a constitution is. A constitution is something which was set up in the past that applies now in the present  and what it says is  no matter how much we might to reelect a popular president for a third term  no matter how much white Americans might choose to feel that they want to reinstate the institution of slavery  we can't. We have bound ourselves. And we bind ourselves in other ways as well. We know that when it comes to choosing somebody for a job  for an award  we are strongly biased by their race  we are biased by their gender  we are biased by how attractive they are  and sometimes we might say   Well fine  that's the way it should be.  But other times we say   This is wrong.  And so to combat this  we don't just try harder  but rather what we do is we set up situations where these other sources of information can't bias us  which is why many orchestras audition musicians behind screens  so the only information they have is the information they believe should matter. I think prejudice and bias illustrate a fundamental duality of human nature. We have gut feelings  instincts  emotions  and they affect our judgments and our actions for good and for evil  but we are also capable of rational deliberation and intelligent planning  and we can use these to  in some cases  accelerate and nourish our emotions  and in other cases staunch them. And it's in this way that reason helps us create a better world. Thank you. I'm a veteran of the starship Enterprise. I soared through the galaxy driving a huge starship with a crew made up of people from all over this world  many different races  many different cultures  many different heritages  all working together  and our mission was to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before. Well   I am the grandson of immigrants from Japan who went to America  boldly going to a strange new world  seeking new opportunities. My mother was born in Sacramento  California. My father was a San Franciscan. They met and married in Los Angeles  and I was born there. I was four years old when Pearl Harbor was bombed on December         by Japan  and overnight  the world was plunged into a world war. America suddenly was swept up by hysteria. Japanese Americans  American citizens of Japanese ancestry  were looked on with suspicion and fear and with outright hatred simply because we happened to look like the people that bombed Pearl Harbor. And the hysteria grew and grew until in February       the president of the United States  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  ordered all Japanese Americans on the West Coast of America to be summarily rounded up with no charges  with no trial  with no due process. Due process  this is a core pillar of our justice system. That all disappeared. We were to be rounded up and imprisoned in    barbed wire prison camps in some of the most desolate places in America  the blistering hot desert of Arizona  the sultry swamps of Arkansas  the wastelands of Wyoming  Idaho  Utah  Colorado  and two of the most desolate places in California. On April   th  I celebrated my fifth birthday  and just a few weeks after my birthday  my parents got my younger brother  my baby sister and me up very early one morning  and they dressed us hurriedly. My brother and I were in the living room looking out the front window  and we saw two soldiers marching up our driveway. They carried bayonets on their rifles. They stomped up the front porch and banged on the door. My father answered it  and the soldiers ordered us out of our home. My father gave my brother and me small luggages to carry  and we walked out and stood on the driveway waiting for our mother to come out  and when my mother finally came out  she had our baby sister in one arm  a huge duffel bag in the other  and tears were streaming down both her cheeks. I will never be able to forget that scene. It is burned into my memory. We were taken from our home and loaded on to train cars with other Japanese American families. There were guards stationed at both ends of each car  as if we were criminals. We were taken two thirds of the way across the country  rocking on that train for four days and three nights  to the swamps of Arkansas. I still remember the barbed wire fence that confined me. I remember the tall sentry tower with the machine guns pointed at us. I remember the searchlight that followed me when I made the night runs from my barrack to the latrine. But to five year old me  I thought it was kind of nice that they'd lit the way for me to pee. I was a child  too young to understand the circumstances of my being there. Children are amazingly adaptable. What would be grotesquely abnormal became my normality in the prisoner of war camps. It became routine for me to line up three times a day to eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall. It became normal for me to go with my father to bathe in a mass shower. Being in a prison  a barbed wire prison camp  became my normality. When the war ended  we were released  and given a one way ticket to anywhere in the United States. My parents decided to go back home to Los Angeles  but Los Angeles was not a welcoming place. We were penniless. Everything had been taken from us  and the hostility was intense. Our first home was on Skid Row in the lowest part of our city  living with derelicts  drunkards and crazy people  the stench of urine all over  on the street  in the alley  in the hallway. It was a horrible experience  and for us kids  it was terrorizing. I remember once a drunkard came staggering down  fell down right in front of us  and threw up. My baby sister said   Mama  let's go back home   because behind barbed wires was for us home. My parents worked hard to get back on their feet. We had lost everything. They were at the middle of their lives and starting all over. They worked their fingers to the bone  and ultimately they were able to get the capital together to buy a three bedroom home in a nice neighborhood. And I was a teenager  and I became very curious about my childhood imprisonment. I had read civics books that told me about the ideals of American democracy. All men are created equal  we have an inalienable right to life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness  and I couldn't quite make that fit with what I knew to be my childhood imprisonment. I read history books  and I couldn't find anything about it. And so I engaged my father after dinner in long  sometimes heated conversations. We had many  many conversations like that  and what I got from them was my father's wisdom. He was the one that suffered the most under those conditions of imprisonment  and yet he understood American democracy. He told me that our democracy is a people's democracy  and it can be as great as the people can be  but it is also as fallible as people are. He told me that American democracy is vitally dependent on good people who cherish the ideals of our system and actively engage in the process of making our democracy work. And he took me to a campaign headquarters   the governor of Illinois was running for the presidency   and introduced me to American electoral politics. And he also told me about young Japanese Americans during the Second World War. When Pearl Harbor was bombed  young Japanese Americans  like all young Americans  rushed to their draft board to volunteer to fight for our country. That act of patriotism was answered with a slap in the face. We were denied service  and categorized as enemy non alien. It was outrageous to be called an enemy when you're volunteering to fight for your country  but that was compounded with the word  non alien   which is a word that means  citizen  in the negative. They even took the word  citizen  away from us  and imprisoned them for a whole year. And then the government realized that there's a wartime manpower shortage  and as suddenly as they'd rounded us up  they opened up the military for service by young Japanese Americans. It was totally irrational  but the amazing thing  the astounding thing  is that thousands of young Japanese American men and women again went from behind those barbed wire fences  put on the same uniform as that of our guards  leaving their families in imprisonment  to fight for this country. They said that they were going to fight not only to get their families out from behind those barbed wire fences  but because they cherished the very ideal of what our government stands for  should stand for  and that was being abrogated by what was being done. All men are created equal. And they went to fight for this country. They were put into a segregated all Japanese American unit and sent to the battlefields of Europe  and they threw themselves into it. They fought with amazing  incredible courage and valor. They were sent out on the most dangerous missions and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate of any unit proportionally. There is one battle that illustrates that. It was a battle for the Gothic Line. The Germans were embedded in this mountain hillside  rocky hillside  in impregnable caves  and three allied battalions had been pounding away at it for six months  and they were stalemated. The    nd was called in to add to the fight  but the men of the    nd came up with a unique but dangerous idea  The backside of the mountain was a sheer rock cliff. The Germans thought an attack from the backside would be impossible. The men of the    nd decided to do the impossible. On a dark  moonless night  they began scaling that rock wall  a drop of more than       feet  in full combat gear. They climbed all night long on that sheer cliff. In the darkness  some lost their handhold or their footing and they fell to their deaths in the ravine below. They all fell silently. Not a single one cried out  so as not to give their position away. The men climbed for eight hours straight  and those who made it to the top stayed there until the first break of light  and as soon as light broke  they attacked. The Germans were surprised  and they took the hill and broke the Gothic Line. A six month stalemate was broken by the    nd in    minutes. It was an amazing act  and when the war ended  the    nd returned to the United States as the most decorated unit of the entire Second World War. They were greeted back on the White House Lawn by President Truman  who said to them   You fought not only the enemy but prejudice  and you won.  They are my heroes. They clung to their belief in the shining ideals of this country  and they proved that being an American is not just for some people  that race is not how we define being an American. They expanded what it means to be an American  including Japanese Americans that were feared and suspected and hated. They were change agents  and they left for me a legacy. They are my heroes and my father is my hero  who understood democracy and guided me through it. They gave me a legacy  and with that legacy comes a responsibility  and I am dedicated to making my country an even better America  to making our government an even truer democracy  and because of the heroes that I have and the struggles that we've gone through  I can stand before you as a gay Japanese American  but even more than that  I am a proud American. Thank you very much. On March           I was in Cambridge at the MIT Media Lab meeting with faculty  students and staff  and we were trying to figure out whether I should be the next director. That night  at midnight  a magnitude   earthquake hit off of the Pacific coast of Japan. My wife and family were in Japan  and as the news started to come in  I was panicking. I was looking at the news streams and listening to the press conferences of the government officials and the Tokyo Power Company  and hearing about this explosion at the nuclear reactors and this cloud of fallout that was headed towards our house which was only about     kilometers away. And the people on TV weren't telling us anything that we wanted to hear. I wanted to know what was going on with the reactor  what was going on with the radiation  whether my family was in danger. So I did what instinctively felt like the right thing  which was to go onto the Internet and try to figure out if I could take matters into my own hands. On the Net  I found there were a lot of other people like me trying to figure out what was going on  and together we sort of loosely formed a group and we called it Safecast  and we decided we were going to try to measure the radiation and get the data out to everybody else  because it was clear that the government wasn't going to be doing this for us. Three years later  we have    million data points  we have designed our own Geiger counters that you can download the designs and plug it into the network. We have an app that shows you most of the radiation in Japan and other parts of the world. We are arguably one of the most successful citizen science projects in the world  and we have created the largest open dataset of radiation measurements. And the interesting thing here is how did    Applause    Thank you. How did a bunch of amateurs who really didn't know what we were doing somehow come together and do what NGOs and the government were completely incapable of doing  And I would suggest that this has something to do with the Internet. It's not a fluke. It wasn't luck  and it wasn't because it was us. It helped that it was an event that pulled everybody together  but it was a new way of doing things that was enabled by the Internet and a lot of the other things that were going on  and I want to talk a little bit about what those new principles are. So remember before the Internet   Laughter  I call this B.I. Okay  So  in B.I.  life was simple. Things were Euclidian  Newtonian  somewhat predictable. People actually tried to predict the future  even the economists. And then the Internet happened  and the world became extremely complex  extremely low cost  extremely fast  and those Newtonian laws that we so dearly cherished turned out to be just local ordinances  and what we found was that in this completely unpredictable world that most of the people who were surviving were working with sort of a different set of principles  and I want to talk a little bit about that. Before the Internet  if you remember  when we tried to create services  what you would do is you'd create the hardware layer and the network layer and the software and it would cost millions of dollars to do anything that was substantial. So when it costs millions of dollars to do something substantial  what you would do is you'd get an MBA who would write a plan and get the money from V.C.s or big companies  and then you'd hire the designers and the engineers  and they'd build the thing. This is the Before Internet  B.I.  innovation model. What happened after the Internet was the cost of innovation went down so much because the cost of collaboration  the cost of distribution  the cost of communication  and Moore's Law made it so that the cost of trying a new thing became nearly zero  and so you would have Google  Facebook  Yahoo  students that didn't have permission   permissionless innovation   didn't have permission  didn't have PowerPoints  they just built the thing  then they raised the money  and then they sort of figured out a business plan and maybe later on they hired some MBAs. So the Internet caused innovation  at least in software and services  to go from an MBA driven innovation model to a designer engineer driven innovation model  and it pushed innovation to the edges  to the dorm rooms  to the startups  away from the large institutions  the stodgy old institutions that had the power and the money and the authority. And we all know this. We all know this happened on the Internet. It turns out it's happening in other things  too. Let me give you some examples. So at the Media Lab  we don't just do hardware. We do all kinds of things. We do biology  we do hardware  and Nicholas Negroponte famously said   Demo or die   as opposed to  Publish or perish   which was the traditional academic way of thinking. And he often said  the demo only has to work once  because the primary mode of us impacting the world was through large companies being inspired by us and creating products like the Kindle or Lego Mindstorms. But today  with the ability to deploy things into the real world at such low cost  I'm changing the motto now  and this is the official public statement. I'm officially saying   Deploy or die.  You have to get the stuff into the real world for it to really count  and sometimes it will be large companies  and Nicholas can talk about satellites. Thank you. But we should be getting out there ourselves and not depending on large institutions to do it for us. So last year  we sent a bunch of students to Shenzhen  and they sat on the factory floors with the innovators in Shenzhen  and it was amazing. What was happening there was you would have these manufacturing devices  and they weren't making prototypes or PowerPoints. They were fiddling with the manufacturing equipment and innovating right on the manufacturing equipment. The factory was in the designer  and the designer was literally in the factory. And so what you would do is  you'd go down to the stalls and you would see these cell phones. So instead of starting little websites like the kids in Palo Alto do  the kids in Shenzhen make new cell phones. They make new cell phones like kids in Palo Alto make websites  and so there's a rainforest of innovation going on in the cell phone. What they do is  they make a cell phone  go down to the stall  they sell some  they look at the other kids' stuff  go up  make a couple thousand more  go down. Doesn't this sound like a software thing  It sounds like agile software development  A B testing and iteration  and what we thought you could only do with software kids in Shenzhen are doing this in hardware. My next fellow  I hope  is going to be one of these innovators from Shenzhen. And so what you see is that is pushing innovation to the edges. We talk about  D printers and stuff like that  and that's great  but this is Limor. She is one of our favorite graduates  and she is standing in front of a Samsung Techwin Pick and Place Machine. This thing can put        components per hour onto an electronics board. This is a factory in a box. So what used to take a factory full of workers working by hand in this little box in New York  she's able to have effectively   She doesn't actually have to go to Shenzhen to do this manufacturing. She can buy this box and she can manufacture it. So manufacturing  the cost of innovation  the cost of prototyping  distribution  manufacturing  hardware  is getting so low that innovation is being pushed to the edges and students and startups are being able to build it. This is a recent thing  but this will happen and this will change just like it did with software. Sorona is a DuPont process that uses a genetically engineered microbe to turn corn sugar into polyester. It's    percent more efficient than the fossil fuel method  and it's much better for the environment. Genetic engineering and bioengineering are creating a whole bunch of great new opportunities for chemistry  for computation  for memory. We will probably be doing a lot  obviously doing health things  but we will probably be growing chairs and buildings soon. The problem is  Sorona costs about     million dollars and took seven years to build. It kind of reminds you of the old mainframe days. The thing is  the cost of innovation in bioengineering is also going down. This is desktop gene sequencer. It used to cost millions and millions of dollars to sequence genes. Now you can do it on a desktop like this  and kids can do this in dorm rooms. This is Gen  gene assembler  and so right now when you try to print a gene  what you do is somebody in a factory with pipettes puts the thing together by hand  you have one error per     base pairs  and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money. This new device assembles genes on a chip  and instead of one error per     base pairs  it's one error per        base pairs. In this lab  we will have the world's capacity of gene printing within a year      million base pairs a year. This is kind of like when we went from transistor radios wrapped by hand to the Pentium. This is going to become the Pentium of bioengineering  pushing bioengineering into the hands of dorm rooms and startup companies. So it's happening in software and in hardware and bioengineering  and so this is a fundamental new way of thinking about innovation. It's a bottom up innovation  it's democratic  it's chaotic  it's hard to control. It's not bad  but it's very different  and I think that the traditional rules that we have for institutions don't work anymore  and most of us here operate with a different set of principles. One of my favorite principles is the power of pull  which is the idea of pulling resources from the network as you need them rather than stocking them in the center and controlling everything. So in the case of the Safecast story  I didn't know anything when the earthquake happened  but I was able to find Sean who was the hackerspace community organizer  and Peter  the analog hardware hacker who made our first Geiger counter  and Dan  who built the Three Mile Island monitoring system after the Three Mile Island meltdown. And these people I wouldn't have been able to find beforehand and probably were better that I found them just in time from the network. I'm a three time college dropout  so learning over education is very near and dear to my heart  but to me  education is what people do to you and learning is what you do to yourself. And it feels like  and I'm biased  it feels like they're trying to make you memorize the whole encyclopedia before they let you go out and play  and to me  I've got Wikipedia on my cell phone  and it feels like they assume you're going to be on top of some mountain all by yourself with a number   pencil trying to figure out what to do when in fact you're always going to be connected  you're always going to have friends  and you can pull Wikipedia up whenever you need it  and what you need to learn is how to learn. In the case of Safecast  a bunch of amateurs when we started three years ago  I would argue that we probably as a group know more than any other organization about how to collect data and publish data and do citizen science. Compass over maps. So this one  the idea is that the cost of writing a plan or mapping something is getting so expensive and it's not very accurate or useful. So in the Safecast story  we knew we needed to collect data  we knew we wanted to publish the data  and instead of trying to come up with the exact plan  we first said  oh  let's get Geiger counters. Oh  they've run out. Let's build them. There aren't enough sensors. Okay  then we can make a mobile Geiger counter. We can drive around. We can get volunteers. We don't have enough money. Let's Kickstarter it. We could not have planned this whole thing  but by having a very strong compass  we eventually got to where we were going  and to me it's very similar to agile software development  but this idea of compasses is very important. So I think the good news is that even though the world is extremely complex  what you need to do is very simple. I think it's about stopping this notion that you need to plan everything  you need to stock everything  and you need to be so prepared  and focus on being connected  always learning  fully aware  and super present. So I don't like the word  futurist.  I think we should be now ists  like we are right now. Thank you. which is in play mode  I'm really interested in how you put people and computers together. We will be using the TV screens or their equivalents for electronic books of the future. Very interested in touch sensitive displays  high tech  high touch  not having to pick up your fingers to use them. There is another way where computers touch people  wearing  physically wearing. Suddenly on September   th  the world got bigger. NN  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. When I was asked to do this  I was also asked to look at all    TED Talks that I had given  chronologically. The first one was actually two hours. The second one was an hour  and then they became half hours  and all I noticed was my bald spot getting bigger. Imagine seeing your life     years of it  go by  and it was  to say the least  for me  quite a shocking experience. So what I'm going to do in my time is try and share with you what happened during the    years  and then also make a prediction  and then tell you a little bit about what I'm doing next. And I put on a slide where TED   happened in my life. And it's rather important because I had done    years of research before it  so I had a backlog  so it was easy. It's not that I was Fidel Castro and I could talk for two hours  or Bucky Fuller. I had    years of stuff  and the Media Lab was about to start. So that was easy. But there are a couple of things about that period and about what happened that are really quite important. One is that it was a period when computers weren't yet for people. And the other thing that sort of happened during that time is that we were considered sissy computer scientists. We weren't considered the real thing. So what I'm going to show you is  in retrospect  a lot more interesting and a lot more accepted than it was at the time. So I'm going to characterize the years and I'm even going to go back to some very early work of mine  and this was the kind of stuff I was doing in the '  s  very direct manipulation  very influenced as I studied architecture by the architect Moshe Safdie  and you can see that we even built robotic things that could build habitat like structures. And this for me was not yet the Media Lab  but was the beginning of what I'll call sensory computing  and I pick fingers partly because everybody thought it was ridiculous. Papers were published about how stupid it was to use fingers. Three reasons  One was they were low resolution. The other is your hand would occlude what you wanted to see  and the third  which was the winner  was that your fingers would get the screen dirty  and hence  fingers would never be a device that you'd use. And this was a device we built in the '  s  which has never even been picked up. It's not just touch sensitive  it's pressure sensitive. NN  Later work  and again this was before TED     Create a large green circle there. Man  Aw  shit. NN    was to sort of do interface concurrently  so when you talked and you pointed and you had  if you will  multiple channels. Entebbe happened.       Air France was hijacked  taken to Entebbe  and the Israelis not only did an extraordinary rescue  they did it partly because they had practiced on a physical model of the airport  because they had built the airport  so they built a model in the desert  and when they arrived at Entebbe  they knew where to go because they had actually been there. The U.S. government asked some of us  '    if we could replicate that computationally  and of course somebody like myself says yes. Immediately  you get a contract  Department of Defense  and we built this truck and this rig. We did sort of a simulation  because you had video discs  and again  this is '  . And then many years later  you get this truck  and so you have Google Maps. Still people thought  no  that was not serious computer science  and it was a man named Jerry Wiesner  who happened to be the president of MIT  who did think it was computer science. And one of the keys for anybody who wants to start something in life  Make sure your president is part of it. So when I was doing the Media Lab  it was like having a gorilla in the front seat. If you were stopped for speeding and the officer looked in the window and saw who was in the passenger seat  then   Oh  continue on  sir.  And so we were able  and this is a cute  actually  device  parenthetically. This was a lenticular photograph of Jerry Wiesner where the only thing that changed in the photograph were the lips. So when you oscillated that little piece of lenticular sheet with his photograph  it would be in lip sync with zero bandwidth. It was a zero bandwidth teleconferencing system at the time. So this was the Media Lab's   this is what we said we'd do  that the world of computers  publishing  and so on would come together. Again  not generally accepted  but very much part of TED in the early days. And this is really where we were headed. And that created the Media Lab. One of the things about age is that I can tell you with great confidence  I've been to the future. I've been there  actually  many times. And the reason I say that is  how many times in my life have I said   Oh  in    years  this will happen   and then    years comes. And then you say   Oh  in five years  this will happen.  And then five years comes. So I say this a little bit with having felt that I'd been there a number of times  and one of the things that is most quoted that I've ever said is that computing is not about computers  and that didn't quite get enough traction  and then it started to. It started to because people caught on that the medium wasn't the message. And the reason I show this car in actually a rather ugly slide is just again to tell you the kind of story that characterized a little bit of my life. This is a student of mine who had done a Ph.D. called  Backseat Driver.  It was in the early days of GPS  the car knew where it was  and it would give audio instructions to the driver  when to turn right   when to turn left and so on. Turns out  there are a lot of things in those instructions that back in that period were pretty challenging  like what does it mean  take the next right  Well  if you're coming up on a street  the next right's probably the one after  and there are lots of issues  and the student did a wonderful thesis  and the MIT patent office said  Don't patent it. It'll never be accepted. The liabilities are too large. There will be insurance issues. Don't patent it.  So we didn't  but it shows you how people  again  at times  don't really look at what's happening. Some work  and I'll just go through these very quickly  a lot of sensory stuff. You might recognize a young Yo Yo Ma and tracking his body for playing the cello or the hypercello. These fellows literally walked  around like that at the time. It's now a little bit more discreet and more commonplace. And then there are at least three heroes I want to quickly mention. Marvin Minsky  who taught me a lot about common sense  and I will talk briefly about Muriel Cooper  who was very important to Ricky Wurman and to TED  and in fact  when she got onstage  she said  the first thing she said was   I introduced Ricky to Nicky.  And nobody calls me Nicky and nobody calls Richard Ricky  so nobody knew who she was talking about. And then  of course  Seymour Papert  who is the person who said   You can't think about thinking unless you think about thinking about something.  And that's actually   you can unpack that later. It's a pretty profound statement. I'm showing some slides that were from TED    a little silly as slides  perhaps. Then I felt television really was about displays. Again  now we're past TED    but just around the time of TED    and what I'd like to mention here is  even though you could imagine intelligence in the device  I look today at some of the work being done about the Internet of Things  and I think it's kind of tragically pathetic  because what has happened is people take the oven panel and put it on your cell phone  or the door key onto your cell phone  just taking it and bringing it to you  and in fact that's actually what you don't want. You want to put a chicken in the oven  and the oven says   Aha  it's a chicken   and it cooks the chicken.  Oh  it's cooking the chicken for Nicholas  and he likes it this way and that way.  So the intelligence  instead of being in the device  we have started today to move it back onto the cell phone or closer to the user  not a particularly enlightened view of the Internet of Things. Television  again  television what I said today  that was back in       and the television of tomorrow would look something like that. Again  people  but they laughed cynically  they didn't laugh with much appreciation. Telecommunications in the     s  George Gilder decided that he would call this diagram the Negroponte switch. I'm probably much less famous than George  so when he called it the Negroponte switch  it stuck  but the idea of things that came in the ground would go in the air and stuff in the air would go into the ground has played itself out. That is the original slide from that year  and it has worked in lockstep obedience. We started Wired magazine. Some people  I remember we shared the reception desk periodically  and some parent called up irate that his son had given up Sports Illustrated to subscribe for Wired  and he said   Are you some porno magazine or something   and couldn't understand why his son would be interested in Wired  at any rate. I will go through this a little quicker. This is my favorite        back page of Newsweek magazine. Okay. Read it.  Laughter    Nicholas Negroponte  director of the MIT Media Lab  predicts that we'll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet. Uh  sure.   Clifford Stoll  Newsweek        You must admit that gives you  at least it gives me pleasure when somebody says how dead wrong you are.  Being Digital  came out. For me  it gave me an opportunity to be more in the trade press and get this out to the public  and it also allowed us to build the new Media Lab  which if you haven't been to  visit  because it's a beautiful piece of architecture aside from being a wonderful place to work. So these are the things we were saying in those TEDs.  Today  multimedia is a desktop or living room experience  because the apparatus is so clunky. This will change dramatically with small  bright  thin  high resolution displays.         We came to them. I looked forward to it every year. It was the party that Ricky Wurman never had in the sense that he invited many of his old friends  including myself. And then something for me changed pretty profoundly. I became more involved with computers and learning and influenced by Seymour  but particularly looking at learning as something that is best approximated by computer programming. When you write a computer program  you've got to not just list things out and sort of take an algorithm and translate it into a set of instructions  but when there's a bug  and all programs have bugs  you've got to de bug it. You've got to go in  change it  and then re execute  and you iterate  and that iteration is really a very  very good approximation of learning. So that led to my own work with Seymour in places like Cambodia and the starting of One Laptop per Child. Enough TED Talks on One Laptop per Child  so I'll go through it very fast  but it did give us the chance to do something at a relatively large scale in the area of learning  development and computing. Very few people know that One Laptop per Child was a    billion project  and it was  at least over the seven years I ran it  but even more important  the World Bank contributed zero  USAID zero. It was mostly the countries using their own treasuries  which is very interesting  at least to me it was very interesting in terms of what I plan to do next. So these are the various places it happened. I then tried an experiment  and the experiment happened in Ethiopia. And here's the experiment. The experiment is  can learning happen where there are no schools. And we dropped off tablets with no instructions and let the children figure it out. And in a short period of time  they not only turned them on and were using    apps per child within five days  they were singing  ABC  songs within two weeks  but they hacked Android within six months. And so that seemed sufficiently interesting. This is perhaps the best picture I have. The kid on your right has sort of nominated himself as teacher. Look at the kid on the left  and so on. There are no adults involved in this at all. So I said  well can we do this at a larger scale  And what is it that's missing  The kids are giving a press conference at this point  and sort of writing in the dirt. And the answer is  what is missing  And I'm going to skip over my prediction  actually  because I'm running out of time  and here's the question  is what's going to happen  I think the challenge is to connect the last billion people  and connecting the last billion is very different than connecting the next billion  and the reason it's different is that the next billion are sort of low hanging fruit  but the last billion are rural. Being rural and being poor are very different. Poverty tends to be created by our society  and the people in that community are not poor in the same way at all. They may be primitive  but the way to approach it and to connect them  the history of One Laptop per Child  and the experiment in Ethiopia  lead me to believe that we can in fact do this in a very short period of time. And so my plan  and unfortunately I haven't been able to get my partners at this point to let me announce them  but is to do this with a stationary satellite. There are many reasons that stationary satellites aren't the best things  but there are a lot of reasons why they are  and for two billion dollars  you can connect a lot more than     million people  but the reason I picked two  and I will leave this as my last slide  is two billion dollars is what we were spending in Afghanistan every week. So surely if we can connect Africa and the last billion people for numbers like that  we should be doing it. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Stay up there. Stay up there. NN  You're going to give me extra time  CA  No. That was wickedly clever  wickedly clever. You gamed it beautifully. Nicholas  what is your prediction  NN  Thank you for asking. I'll tell you what my prediction is  and my prediction  and this is a prediction  because it'll be    years. I won't be here. But one of the things about learning how to read  we have been doing a lot of consuming of information going through our eyes  and so that may be a very inefficient channel. So my prediction is that we are  going to ingest information You're going to swallow a pill and know English. You're going to swallow a pill and know Shakespeare. And the way to do it is through the bloodstream. So once it's in your bloodstream  it basically goes through it and gets into the brain  and when it knows that it's in the brain in the different pieces  it deposits it in the right places. So it's ingesting. CA  Have you been hanging out with Ray Kurzweil by any chance  NN  No  but I've been hanging around with Ed Boyden and hanging around with one of the speakers who is here  Hugh Herr  and there are a number of people. This isn't quite as far fetched  so    years from now. CA  We will check it out. We're going to be back and we're going to play this clip    years from now  and then all eat the red pill. Well thank you for that. Nicholas Negroponte. NN  Thank you. When I was preparing for this talk  I went to search for a couple of quotes that I can share with you. Good news  I found three that I particularly liked  the first by Samuel Johnson  who said   When making your choice in life  do not forget to live   the second by Aeschylus  who reminded us that  happiness is a choice that requires effort   and the third is one by Groucho Marx who said   I wouldn't want to choose to belong to any club that would have me as a member.  Now  bad news  I didn't know which one of these quotes to choose and share with you. The sweet anxiety of choice. In today's times of post industrial capitalism  choice  together with individual freedom and the idea of self making  has been elevated to an ideal. Now  together with this  we also have a belief in endless progress. But the underside of this ideology has been an increase of anxiety  feelings of guilt  feelings of being inadequate  feeling that we are failing in our choices. Sadly  this ideology of individual choice has prevented us from thinking about social changes. It appears that this ideology was actually very efficient in pacifying us as political and social thinkers. Instead of making social critiques  we are more and more engaging in self critique  sometimes to the point of self destruction. Now  how come that ideology of choice is still so powerful  even among people who have not many things to choose among  How come that even people who are poor very much still identify with the idea of choice  the kind of rational idea of choice which we embrace  Now  the ideology of choice is very successful in opening for us a space to think about some imagined future. Let me give you an example. My friend Manya  when she was a student at university in California  was earning money by working for a car dealer. Now  Manya  when she encountered the typical customer  would debate with him about his lifestyle  how much he wants to spend  how many children he has  what does he need the car for  They would usually come to a good conclusion what would be a perfect car. Now  before Manya's customer would go home and think things through  she would say to him   The car that you are buying now is perfect  but in a few year's time  when your kids will be already out of the house  when you will have a little bit more money  that other car will be ideal. But what you are buying now is great.  Now  the majority of Manya's customers who came back the next day bought that other car  the car they did not need  the car that cost far too much money. Now  Manya became so successful in selling cars that soon she moved on to selling airplanes. And knowing so much about the psychology of people prepared her well for her current job  which is that of a psychoanalyst. Now  why were Manya's customers so irrational  Manya's success was that she was able to open in their heads an image of an idealized future  an image of themselves when they are already more successful  freer  and for them  choosing that other car was as if they are coming closer to this ideal in which it was as if Manya already saw them. Now  we rarely make really totally rational choices. Choices are influenced by our unconscious  by our community. We're often choosing by guessing  what would other people think about our choice  Also we are choosing by looking at what others are choosing. We're also guessing what is socially acceptable choice. Now  because of this  we actually even after we have already chosen  like bought a car  endlessly read reviews about cars  as if we still want to convince ourselves that we made the right choice. Now  choices are anxiety provoking. They are linked to risks  losses. They are highly unpredictable. Now  because of this  people have now more and more problems that they are not choosing anything. Not long ago  I was at a wedding reception  and I met a young  beautiful woman who immediately started telling me about her anxiety over choice. She said to me   I needed one month to decide which dress to wear.  Then she said   For weeks I was researching which hotel to stay for this one night. And now  I need to choose a sperm donor.  I looked at this woman in shock.  Sperm donor  What's the rush   She said   I'm turning    at the end of this year  and I've been so bad in choosing men in my life.  Now choice  because it's linked to risk  is anxiety provoking  and it was already the famous Danish philosopher S ren Kierkegaard who pointed out that anxiety is linked to the possibility of possibility. Now  we think today that we can prevent these risks. We have endless market analysis  projections of the future earnings. Even with market  which is about chance  randomness  we think we can predict rationally where it's going. Now  chance is actually becoming very traumatic. Last year  my friend Bernard Harcourt at the University of Chicago organized an event  a conference on the idea of chance. He and I were together on the panel  and just before delivering our papers   we didn't know each other's papers   we decided to take chance seriously. So we informed our audience that what they will just now hear will be a random paper  a mixture of the two papers which we didn't know what each was writing. Now  we delivered the conference in such a way. Bernard read his first paragraph  I read my first paragraph  Bernard read his second paragraph  I read my second paragraph  in this way towards the end of our papers. Now  you will be surprised that a majority of our audience did not think that what they'd just listened to was a completely random paper. They couldn't believe that speaking from the position of authority like two professors we were  we would take chance seriously. They thought we prepared the papers together and were just joking that it's random. Now  we live in times with a lot of information  big data  a lot of knowledge about the insides of our bodies. We decoded our genome. We know about our brains more than before. But surprisingly  people are more and more turning a blind eye in front of this knowledge. Ignorance and denial are on the rise. Now  in regard to the current economic crisis  we think that we will just wake up again and everything will be the same as before  and no political or social changes are needed. In regard to ecological crisis  we think nothing needs to be done just now  or others need to act before us. Or even when ecological crisis already happens  like a catastrophe in Fukushima  often we have people living in the same environment with the same amount of information  and half of them will be anxious about radiation and half of them will ignore it. Now  psychoanalysts know very well that people surprisingly don't have passion for knowledge but passion for ignorance. Now  what does that mean  Let's say when we are facing a life threatening illness  a lot of people don't want to know that. They'd rather prefer denying the illness  which is why it's not so wise to inform them if they don't ask. Surprisingly  research shows that sometimes people who deny their illness live longer than those who are rationally choosing the best treatment. Now  this ignorance  however  is not very helpful on the level of the social. When we are ignorant about where we are heading  a lot of social damage can be caused. Now  on top of facing ignorance  we are also facing today some kind of an obviousness. Now  it was French philosopher Louis Althusser who pointed out that ideology functions in such a way that it creates a veil of obviousness. Before we do any social critique  it is necessary really to lift that veil of obviousness and to think through a little bit differently. If we go back to this ideology of individual  rational choice we often embrace  it's necessary precisely here to lift this obviousness and to think a little bit differently. Now for me  a question often is why we still embrace this idea of a self made man on which capitalism relied from its beginning  Why do we think that we are really such masters of our lives that we can rationally make the best ideal choices  that we don't accept losses and risks  And for me  it's very shocking to see sometimes very poor people  for example  not supporting the idea of the rich being taxed more. Quite often here they still identify with a certain kind of a lottery mentality. Okay  maybe they don't think that they will make it in the future  but maybe they think  my son might become the next Bill Gates. And who would want to tax one's son  Or  a question for me is also  why would people who have no health insurance not embrace universal healthcare  Sometimes they don't embrace it  again identifying with the idea of choice  but they have nothing to choose from. Now  Margaret Thatcher famously said that there is nothing like a society. Society doesn't exist  it is only individuals and their families. Sadly  this ideology still functions very well  which is why people who are poor might feel ashamed for their poverty. We might endlessly feel guilty that we are not making the right choices  and that's why we didn't succeed. We are anxious that we are not good enough. That's why we work very hard  long hours at the workplace and equally long hours on remaking ourselves. Now  when we are anxious over choices  sometimes we easily give our power of choice away. We identify with the guru who tells us what to do  self help therapist  or we embrace a totalitarian leader who appears to have no doubts about choices  who sort of knows. Now  often people ask me   What did you learn by studying choice   And there is an important message that I did learn. When thinking about choices  I stopped taking choices too seriously  personally. First  I realized a lot of choice I make is not rational. It's linked to my unconscious  my guesses of what others are choosing  or what is a socially embraced choice. I also embrace the idea that we should go beyond thinking about individual choices  that it's very important to rethink social choices  since this ideology of individual choice has pacified us. It really prevented us to think about social change. We spend so much time choosing things for ourselves and barely reflect on communal choices we can make. Now  we should not forget that choice is always linked to change. We can make individual changes  but we can make social changes. We can choose to have more wolves. We can choose to change our environment to have more bees. We can choose to have different rating agencies. We can choose to control corporations instead of allowing corporations to control us. We have a possibility to make changes. Now  I started with a quote from Samuel Johnson  who said that when we make choice in life  we shouldn't forget to live. Finally  you can see I did have a choice to choose one of the three quotes with which I wanted to start my lecture. I did have a choice  such as nations  as people  we have choices too to rethink in what kind of society we want to live in the future. Thank you. Could I protect my father from the Armed Islamic Group with a paring knife  That was the question I faced one Tuesday morning in June of       when I was a law student. I woke up early that morning in Dad's apartment on the outskirts of Algiers  Algeria  to an unrelenting pounding on the front door. It was a season as described by a local paper when every Tuesday a scholar fell to the bullets of fundamentalist assassins. My father's university teaching of Darwin had already provoked a classroom visit from the head of the so called Islamic Salvation Front  who denounced Dad as an advocate of biologism before Dad had ejected the man  and now whoever was outside would neither identify himself nor go away. So my father tried to get the police on the phone  but perhaps terrified by the rising tide of armed extremism that had already claimed the lives of so many Algerian officers  they didn't even answer. And that was when I went to the kitchen  got out a paring knife  and took up a position inside the entryway. It was a ridiculous thing to do  really  but I couldn't think of anything else  and so there I stood. When I look back now  I think that that was the moment that set me on the path was to writing a book called  Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here  Untold Stories from the Fight Against Muslim Fundamentalism.  The title comes from a Pakistani play. I think it was actually that moment that sent me on the journey to interview     people of Muslim heritage from nearly    countries  from Afghanistan to Mali  to find out how they fought fundamentalism peacefully like my father did  and how they coped with the attendant risks. Luckily  back in June of       our unidentified visitor went away  but other families were so much less lucky  and that was the thought that motivated my research. In any case  someone would return a few months later and leave a note on Dad's kitchen table  which simply said   Consider yourself dead.  Subsequently  Algeria's fundamentalist armed groups would murder as many as         civilians in what came to be known as the dark decade of the     s  including every single one of the women that you see here. In its harsh counterterrorist response  the state resorted to torture and to forced disappearances  and as terrible as all of these events became  the international community largely ignored them. Finally  my father  an Algerian peasant's son turned professor  was forced to stop teaching at the university and to flee his apartment  but what I will never forget about Mahfoud Bennoune  my dad  was that like so many other Algerian intellectuals  he refused to leave the country and he continued to publish pointed criticisms  both of the fundamentalists and sometimes of the government they battled. For example  in a November      series in the newspaper El Watan entitled  How Fundamentalism Produced a Terrorism without Precedent   he denounced what he called the terrorists' radical break with the true Islam as it was lived by our ancestors. These were words that could get you killed. My father's country taught me in that dark decade of the     s that the popular struggle against Muslim fundamentalism is one of the most important and overlooked human rights struggles in the world. This remains true today  nearly    years later. You see  in every country where you hear about armed jihadis targeting civilians  there are also unarmed people defying those militants that you don't hear about  and those people need our support to succeed. In the West  it's often assumed that Muslims generally condone terrorism. Some on the right think this because they view Muslim culture as inherently violent  and some on the left imagine this because they view Muslim violence  fundamentalist violence  solely as a product of legitimate grievances. But both views are dead wrong. In fact  many people of Muslim heritage around the world are staunch opponents both of fundamentalism and of terrorism  and often for very good reason. You see  they're much more likely to be victims of this violence than its perpetrators. Let me just give you one example. According to a      survey of Arabic language media resources  between      and       no more than    percent of al Qaeda's victims were Westerners. That's a terrible toll  but the vast majority were people of Muslim heritage  killed by Muslim fundamentalists. Now I've been talking for the last five minutes about fundamentalism  and you have a right to know exactly what I mean. I cite the definition given by the Algerian sociologist Marieme Helie Lucas  and she says that fundamentalisms  note the  s   so within all of the world's great religious traditions   fundamentalisms are political movements of the extreme right which in a context of globalization manipulate religion in order to achieve their political aims.  Sadia Abbas has called this the radical politicization of theology. Now I want to avoid projecting the notion that there's sort of a monolith out there called Muslim fundamentalism that is the same everywhere  because these movements also have their diversities. Some use and advocate violence. Some do not  though they're often interrelated. They take different forms. Some may be non governmental organizations  even here in Britain like Cageprisoners. Some may become political parties  like the Muslim Brotherhood  and some may be openly armed groups like the Taliban. But in any case  these are all radical projects. They're not conservative or traditional approaches. They're most often about changing people's relationship with Islam rather than preserving it. What I am talking about is the Muslim extreme right  and the fact that its adherents are or purport to be Muslim makes them no less offensive than the extreme right anywhere else. So in my view  if we consider ourselves liberal or left wing  human rights loving or feminist  we must oppose these movements and support their grassroots opponents. Now let me be clear that I support an effective struggle against fundamentalism  but also a struggle that must itself respect international law  so nothing I am saying should be taken as a justification for refusals to democratize  and here I send out a shout out of support to the pro democracy movement  in Algeria today  Barakat. Nor should anything I say be taken as a justification of violations of human rights  like the mass death sentences handed out in Egypt earlier this week. But what I am saying is that we must challenge these Muslim fundamentalist movements because they threaten human rights across Muslim majority contexts  and they do this in a range of ways  most obviously with the direct attacks on civilians by the armed groups that carry those out. But that violence is just the tip of the iceberg. These movements as a whole purvey discrimination against religious minorities and sexual minorities. They seek to curtail the freedom of religion of everyone who either practices in a different way or chooses not to practice. And most definingly  they lead an all out war on the rights of women. Now  faced with these movements in recent years  Western discourse has most often offered two flawed responses. The first that one sometimes finds on the right suggests that most Muslims are fundamentalist or something about Islam is inherently fundamentalist  and this is just offensive and wrong  but unfortunately on the left one sometimes encounters a discourse that is too politically correct to acknowledge the problem of Muslim fundamentalism at all or  even worse  apologizes for it  and this is unacceptable as well. So what I'm seeking is a new way of talking about this all together  which is grounded in the lived experiences and the hope of the people on the front lines. I'm painfully aware that there has been an increase in discrimination against Muslims in recent years in countries like the U.K. and the U.S.  and that too is a matter of grave concern  but I firmly believe that telling these counter stereotypical stories of people of Muslim heritage who have confronted the fundamentalists and been their primary victims is also a great way of countering that discrimination. So now let me introduce you to four people whose stories I had the great honor of telling. Faizan Peerzada and the Rafi Peer Theatre workshop named for his father have for years promoted the performing arts in Pakistan. With the rise of jihadist violence  they began to receive threats to call off their events  which they refused to heed. And so a bomber struck their      eighth world performing arts festival in Lahore  producing rain of glass that fell into the venue injuring nine people  and later that same night  the Peerzadas made a very difficult decision  they announced that their festival would continue as planned the next day. As Faizan said at the time  if we bow down to the Islamists  we'll just be sitting in a dark corner. But they didn't know what would happen. Would anyone come  In fact  thousands of people came out the next day to support the performing arts in Lahore  and this simultaneously thrilled and terrified Faizan  and he ran up to a woman who had come in with her two small children  and he said   You do know there was a bomb here yesterday  and you do know there's a threat here today.  And she said   I know that  but I came to your festival with my mother when I was their age  and I still have those images in my mind. We have to be here.  With stalwart audiences like this  the Peerzadas were able to conclude their festival on schedule. And then the next year  they lost all of their sponsors due to the security risk. So when I met them in       they were in the middle of the first subsequent event that they were able to have in the same venue  and this was the ninth youth performing arts festival held in Lahore in a year when that city had already experienced    terror attacks. This was a time when the Pakistani Taliban had commenced their systematic targeting of girls' schools that would culminate in the attack on Malala Yousafzai. What did the Peerzadas do in that environment  They staged girls' school theater. So I had the privilege of watching  Naang Wal   which was a musical in the Punjabi language  and the girls of Lahore Grammar School played all the parts. They sang and danced  they played the mice and the water buffalo  and I held my breath  wondering  would we get to the end of this amazing show  And when we did  the whole audience collectively exhaled  and a few people actually wept  and then they filled the auditorium with the peaceful boom of their applause. And I remember thinking in that moment that the bombers made headlines here two years before but this night and these people are as important a story. Maria Bashir is the first and only woman chief prosecutor in Afghanistan. She's been in the post since      and actually opened an office to investigate cases of violence against women  which she says is the most important area in her mandate. When I meet her in her office in Herat  she enters surrounded by four large men with four huge guns. In fact  she now has    bodyguards  because she has weathered bomb attacks that nearly killed her kids  and it took the leg off of one of her guards. Why does she continue  She says with a smile that that is the question that everyone asks  as she puts it   Why you risk not living   And it is simply that for her  a better future for all the Maria Bashirs to come is worth the risk  and she knows that if people like her do not take the risk  there will be no better future. Later on in our interview  Prosecutor Bashir tells me how worried she is about the possible outcome of government negotiations with the Taliban  the people who have been trying to kill her.  If we give them a place in the government   she asks   Who will protect women's rights   And she urges the international community not to forget its promise about women because now they want peace with Taliban. A few weeks after I leave Afghanistan  I see a headline on the Internet. An Afghan prosecutor has been assassinated. I google desperately  and thankfully that day I find out that Maria was not the victim  though sadly  another Afghan prosecutor was gunned down on his way to work. And when I hear headlines like that now  I think that as international troops leave Afghanistan this year and beyond  we must continue to care about what happens to people there  to all of the Maria Bashirs. Sometimes I still hear her voice in my head saying  with no bravado whatsoever   The situation of the women of Afghanistan will be better someday. We should prepare the ground for this  even if we are killed.  There are no words adequate to denounce the al Shabaab terrorists who attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi on the same day as a children's cooking competition in September of     . They killed     including poets and pregnant women. Far away in the American Midwest  I had the good fortune of meeting Somali Americans who were working to counter the efforts of al Shabaab to recruit a small number of young people from their city of Minneapolis to take part in atrocities like Westgate. Abdirizak Bihi's studious    year old nephew Burhan Hassan was recruited here in       spirited to Somalia  and then killed when he tried to come home. Since that time  Mr. Bihi  who directs the no budget Somali Education and Advocacy Center  has been vocally denouncing the recruitment and the failures of government and Somali American institutions like the Abubakar As Saddique Islamic Center where he believes his nephew was radicalized during a youth program. But he doesn't just criticize the mosque. He also takes on the government for its failure to do more to prevent poverty in his community. Given his own lack of financial resources  Mr. Bihi has had to be creative. To counter the efforts of al Shabaab to sway more disaffected youth  in the wake of the group's      attack on World Cup viewers in Uganda  he organized a Ramadan basketball tournament in Minneapolis in response. Scores of Somali American kids came out to embrace sport despite the fatwa against it. They played basketball as Burhan Hassan never would again. For his efforts  Mr. Bihi has been ostracized by the leadership of the Abubakar As Saddique Islamic Center  with which he used to have good relations. He told me   One day we saw the imam on TV calling us infidels and saying  'These families are trying to destroy the mosque.'  This is at complete odds with how Abdirizak Bihi understands what he is trying to do by exposing al Shabaab recruitment  which is to save the religion I love from a small number of extremists. Now I want to tell one last story  that of a    year old law student in Algeria named Amel Zenoune Zouani who had the same dreams of a legal career that I did back in the '  s. She refused to give up her studies  despite the fact that the fundamentalists battling the Algerian state back then threatened all who continued their education. On January           Amel boarded the bus in Algiers where she was studying to go home and spend a Ramadan evening with her family  and would never finish law school. When the bus reached the outskirts of her hometown  it was stopped at a checkpoint manned by men from the Armed Islamic Group. Carrying her schoolbag  Amel was taken off the bus and killed in the street. The men who cut her throat then told everyone else   If you go to university  the day will come when we will kill all of you just like this.  Amel died at exactly      p.m.  which we know because when she fell in the street  her watch broke. Her mother showed me the watch with the second hand still aimed optimistically upward towards a      that would never come. Shortly before her death  Amel had said to her mother of herself and her sisters   Nothing will happen to us  Inshallah  God willing  but if something happens  you must know that we are dead for knowledge. You and father must keep your heads held high.  The loss of such a young woman is unfathomable  and so as I did my research I found myself searching for Amel's hope again and her name even means  hope  in Arabic. I think I found it in two places. The first is in the strength of her family and all the other families to continue telling their stories and to go on with their lives despite the terrorism. In fact  Amel's sister Lamia overcame her grief  went to law school  and practices as a lawyer in Algiers today  something which is only possible because the armed fundamentalists were largely defeated in the country. And the second place I found Amel's hope was everywhere that women and men continue to defy the jihadis. We must support all of those in honor of Amel who continue this human rights struggle today  like the Network of Women Living Under Muslim Laws. It is not enough  as the victims rights advocate Cherifa Kheddar told me in Algiers  it is not enough just to battle terrorism. We must also challenge fundamentalism  because fundamentalism is the ideology that makes the bed of this terrorism. Why is it that people like her  like all of them are not more well known  Why is it that everyone knows who Osama bin Laden was and so few know of all of those standing up to the bin Ladens in their own contexts. We must change that  and so I ask you to please help share these stories through your networks. Look again at Amel Zenoune's watch  forever frozen  and now please look at your own watch and decide this is the moment that you commit to supporting people like Amel. We don't have the right to be silent about them because it is easier or because Western policy is flawed as well  because      is still coming to too many Amel Zenounes in places like northern Nigeria  where jihadis still kill students. The time to speak up in support of all of those who peacefully challenge fundamentalism and terrorism in their own communities is now. Thank you. Puzzles and magic. I work in what most people think are two distinct fields  but I believe they are the same. I am both a magician and a New York Times crossword puzzle constructor  which basically means I've taken the world's two nerdiest hobbies and combined them into one career. And I believe that magic and puzzles are the same because they both key into one of the most important human drives  the urge to solve. Human beings are wired to solve  to make order out of chaos. It's certainly true for me. I've been solving my whole life. High school consisted of epic Scrabble matches in the cafeteria and not really talking to girls  and then at about that time I started learning magic tricks and definitely not talking to girls. There's nothing like starting a conversation with   Hey  did you know that 'prestidigitation' is worth    points in Scrabble   But back then  I noticed an intersection between puzzles and illusion. When you do the crossword puzzle or when you watch a magic show  you become a solver  and your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos  the chaos of  say  a black and white puzzle grid  a mixed up bag of Scrabble tiles  or a shuffled pack of playing cards. And today  as a cruciverbalist      points   and an illusion designer  I create that chaos. I test your ability to solve. Now  it turns out research tells us that solving is as primal as eating and sleeping. From birth  we are wired to solve. In one UCLA study  newborns still in the hospital were shown patterns  patterns like this  circle  cross  circle  cross. And then the pattern was changed  triangle  square. And by tracking an infant's gaze  we know that newborns as young as a day old can notice and respond to disruptions in order. It's remarkable. So from infancy through old age  the urge to solve unites us all  and I even found this photo on Instagram of pop star Katy Perry solving a crossword puzzle with her morning coffee. Like. Now  solving exists across all cultures. The American invention is the crossword puzzle  and this year we are celebrating the    th anniversary of the crossword puzzle  first published in The New York World. But many other cultures have their signature puzzles as well. China gives us tangrams  which would test solvers' abilities to form shapes from the jumbled pieces. Chaos. Order. Order. And order. That one's my favorite  let's hear it again. Okay. And how about this puzzle invented in   th century England  the jigsaw puzzle. Is this not making order out of chaos  So as you can see  we are always solving. We are always trying to decode our world. It's an eternal quest. It's just like the one Cervantes wrote about in  Don Quixote   which by the way is the root of the word  quixotry   the highest scoring Scrabble word of all time      points. But anyway   Don Quixote  is an important book. You guys have read  Don Quixote   yes  I'm seeing some heads nod. Come on guys  really  Who's read  Don Quixote   Let's do this. Raise your hands if you've read  Don Quixote.  There we go. Smart audience. Who's read  Don Quixote   Get them up. Okay  good  because I need somebody smart here because now I'm going to demonstrate with the help of one of you just how deeply rooted your urge to solve is  just how wired to solve all of you really are  so I'm going to come into the audience and find somebody to help me. Let's see. Everybody's looking away all of a sudden. Can I  Would you  What is your name  Gwen. I'm not a mind reader  I can see your name tag. Come with me  Gwen. Everyone give her  a round of applause  make her feel welcome. Gwen  after you. Are you so excited  Did you know that your name is worth eight points in Scrabble  Okay  stand right here  Gwen  right here. Now  Gwen  before we begin  I'd like to point out a piece of the puzzle  which is here in this envelope  and I will not go near it. Okay  And over here we have a drawing of some farm animals. You can see we have an owl  we have a horse  a donkey  a rooster  an ox  and a sheep  and then here  Gwen  we have some fancy art store markers  colors like  can you see that word right there  Gwen  Cobalt. David Kwong  Cobalt  yes. Cobalt. But we have a silver  a red  an emerald  and an amber marker  and Gwen  you are going to color this drawing just like you were five years old  one marker at a time. It's going to be a lot of fun. But I'm going to go over here. I don't want to see what you're doing. Okay  so don't start yet. Wait for me to get over here and close my eyes. Now Gwen  are you ready  Pick up just one marker  pick up just one marker  and why don't you color in the horse for me  Color in the horse   big  big  big scribbles  broad strokes  don't worry about staying in the lines. All right. Great. And why don't you take that marker and recap it and place it on the table for me. Okay  and pick up another marker out of the cup and take off the cap and color in the donkey for me  color in the donkey. Big scribbles. Okay  cool  and re cap that marker and place it on the table. And pick up another marker for me and take off the cap. Isn't this fun  And color in the owl for me. Color in the owl. Okay  and recap that marker and pick up another marker out of the cup and color in the rooster for me  color in the rooster. Good  good  good  good  good. Big  big  big strokes. Good  good. Pick up another marker out of the cup and color in the ox for me. Color in the ox. Okay  good. A lot of color on that  and recap  and place it on the table  and pick up another marker out of the cup. Oh  I'm out  Okay  I'm going to turn around. Did I forget  Oh  I forgot my purple marker. This is still going to work  though. I think this is still going to work  mostly. So Gwen  I'm going to hand you this envelope. Don't open it yet. Do not open it yet  but I am going to write down your choices so that everybody can see the choices that you made. Okay  great. So we have a cobalt horse  amber owl  a silver ox  yes  okay  a red donkey  and what was the emerald color  A rooster. An emerald rooster. Okay. Now for the moment of truth  Gwen  we're going to take a look in that envelope. Why don't you open it up and remove the one piece of paper from inside and hand it to me  and we will see if it matches your choices. Yes  I think it does. We have a cobalt horse  we have a red donkey  we have an amber owl  we have an emerald rooster  a silver ox  I forgot my purple marker so we have a blank sheep  but that's a pretty amazing coincidence  don't you think  Gwen  well done. That's beautiful.  Applause  I'll take that back from you. So ladies and gentlemen  how is this possible  How is this possible  Well  could it be that Gwen's brain is so wired to solve that she decoded hidden messages  Well this is the puzzle I present to you. Could there be order in the chaos that I created  Let's take a closer look. Do you recall when I showed you these puzzle pieces  What image did it ultimately become  A cobalt horse. The plot thickens. And then we played a game of tangrams with an emerald rooster. That one's my favorite. And then we had an experiment with a silver ox. And Katy Perry drinks her morning coffee out of an amber owl. Thank you  Katy  for taking that photo for me. Oh  and there's one more  there's one more. I believe you colored a red donkey  Gwen. Ladies and gentlemen  could you raise your hands for me if you've read  Don Quixote   Who's read  Don Quixote    Laughter  But wait  but wait  wait  wait  wait  there's more. There's more. Gwen  I was so confident that you were going to make these choices that I made another prediction  and I put it in an even more indelible place  and it's right here. Ladies and gentlemen  we have today's New York Times. The date is March   th      . Many of you in the first couple of rows have it underneath your seats as well. Really dig. We hid them under there. See if you can fish out the newspaper and open up to the arts section and you will find the crossword puzzle  and the crossword puzzle today was written by yours truly. You can see my name above the grid. I'm going to give this to you  Gwen  to take a look. And I will also put it up on the screen. Now let's take a look at another piece of the puzzle. If you look at the first clue for   across  it starts with the letter C  for corrupt  and just below that we have an O  for outfielder  and if you keep reading the first letters of the clues down  you get cobalt horse  amber owl  silver ox  red donkey  and emerald rooster. That's pretty cool  right  It's The New York Times. But wait  wait  wait  wait. Wait. Oh  Gwen  do you recall how I forgot my purple marker  and you were unable to color the sheep  Well  if you keep reading starting with    down  it says   Oh  by the way  the sheep can be left blank.  But wait  wait  wait  there's one more thing  there's one more thing  there's one final piece of the puzzle. Gwen  I am so grateful for your choices because if we take a look at the first letters of your combinations  we get  C H A O S  for chaos and  O R D E R  for order. That's chaos and order. We've all made order out of chaos. So ladies and gentlemen  the next time you find yourself with a puzzle  whether it's in your life or in your work  or maybe it's at the Sunday morning breakfast table with The New York Times  remember  you are all wired to solve. Thank you. Right now you have a movie playing inside your head. It's an amazing multi track movie. It has  D vision and surround sound for what you're seeing and hearing right now  but that's just the start of it. Your movie has smell and taste and touch. It has a sense of your body  pain  hunger  orgasms. It has emotions  anger and happiness. It has memories  like scenes from your childhood playing before you. And it has this constant voiceover narrative in your stream of conscious thinking. At the heart of this movie is you experiencing all this directly. This movie is your stream of consciousness  the subject of experience of the mind and the world. Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts of human existence. Each of us is conscious. We all have our own inner movie  you and you and you. There's nothing we know about more directly. At least  I know about my consciousness directly. I can't be certain that you guys are conscious. Consciousness also is what makes life worth living. If we weren't conscious  nothing in our lives would have meaning or value. But at the same time  it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe. Why are we conscious  Why do we have these inner movies  Why aren't we just robots who process all this input  produce all that output  without experiencing the inner movie at all  Right now  nobody knows the answers to those questions. I'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness into science  some radical ideas may be needed. Some people say a science of consciousness is impossible. Science  by its nature  is objective. Consciousness  by its nature  is subjective. So there can never be a science of consciousness. For much of the   th century  that view held sway. Psychologists studied behavior objectively  neuroscientists studied the brain objectively  and nobody even mentioned consciousness. Even    years ago  when TED got started  there was very little scientific work on consciousness. Now  about    years ago  all that began to change. Neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Penrose said now is the time for science to attack consciousness. And since then  there's been a real explosion  a flowering of scientific work on consciousness. And this work has been wonderful. It's been great. But it also has some fundamental limitations so far. The centerpiece of the science of consciousness in recent years has been the search for correlations  correlations between certain areas of the brain and certain states of consciousness. We saw some of this kind of work from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work she presented just a few minutes ago. Now we understand much better  for example  the kinds of brain areas that go along with the conscious experience of seeing faces or of feeling pain or of feeling happy. But this is still a science of correlations. It's not a science of explanations. We know that these brain areas go along with certain kinds of conscious experience  but we don't know why they do. I like to put this by saying that this kind of work from neuroscience is answering some of the questions we want answered about consciousness  the questions about what certain brain areas do and what they correlate with. But in a certain sense  those are the easy problems. No knock on the neuroscientists. There are no truly easy problems with consciousness. But it doesn't address the real mystery at the core of this subject  why is it that all that physical processing in a brain should be accompanied by consciousness at all  Why is there this inner subjective movie  Right now  we don't really have a bead on that. And you might say  let's just give neuroscience a few years. It'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon like traffic jams  like hurricanes  like life  and we'll figure it out. The classical cases of emergence are all cases of emergent behavior  how a traffic jam behaves  how a hurricane functions  how a living organism reproduces and adapts and metabolizes  all questions about objective functioning. You could apply that to the human brain in explaining some of the behaviors and the functions of the human brain as emergent phenomena  how we walk  how we talk  how we play chess  all these questions about behavior. But when it comes to consciousness  questions about behavior are among the easy problems. When it comes to the hard problem  that's the question of why is it that all this behavior is accompanied by subjective experience  And here  the standard paradigm of emergence  even the standard paradigms of neuroscience  don't really  so far  have that much to say. Now  I'm a scientific materialist at heart. I want a scientific theory of consciousness that works  and for a long time  I banged my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in purely physical terms that would work. But I eventually came to the conclusion that that just didn't work for systematic reasons. It's a long story  but the core idea is just that what you get from purely reductionist explanations in physical terms  in brain based terms  is stories about the functioning of a system  its structure  its dynamics  the behavior it produces  great for solving the easy problems   how we behave  how we function   but when it comes to subjective experience   why does all this feel like something from the inside    that's something fundamentally new  and it's always a further question. So I think we're at a kind of impasse here. We've got this wonderful  great chain of explanation  we're used to it  where physics explains chemistry  chemistry explains biology  biology explains parts of psychology. But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this picture. On the one hand  it's a datum that we're conscious. On the other hand  we don't know how to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world. So I think consciousness right now is a kind of anomaly  one that we need to integrate into our view of the world  but we don't yet see how. Faced with an anomaly like this  radical ideas may be needed  and I think that we may need one or two ideas that initially seem crazy before we can come to grips with consciousness scientifically. Now  there are a few candidates for what those crazy ideas might be. My friend Dan Dennett  who's here today  has one. His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness. The whole idea of the inner subjective movie involves a kind of illusion or confusion. Actually  all we've got to do is explain the objective functions  the behaviors of the brain  and then we've explained everything that needs to be explained. Well I say  more power to him. That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if you want to have a purely reductionist brain based theory of consciousness. At the same time  for me and for many other people  that view is a bit too close to simply denying the datum of consciousness to be satisfactory. So I go in a different direction. In the time remaining  I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think may have some promise. The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental. Physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental building blocks  space and time and mass. They postulate fundamental laws governing them  like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics. These fundamental properties and laws aren't explained in terms of anything more basic. Rather  they're taken as primitive  and you build up the world from there. Now sometimes  the list of fundamentals expands. In the   th century  Maxwell figured out that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals   space  time  mass  Newton's laws   so he postulated fundamental laws of electromagnetism and postulated electric charge as a fundamental element that those laws govern. I think that's the situation we're in with consciousness. If you can't explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals   space  time  mass  charge   then as a matter of logic  you need to expand the list. The natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental  a fundamental building block of nature. This doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it. This opens up the way for you to do science with it. What we then need is to study the fundamental laws governing consciousness  the laws that connect consciousness to other fundamentals  space  time  mass  physical processes. Physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could write them on the front of a t shirt. Well I think something like that is the situation we're in with consciousness. We want to find fundamental laws so simple we could write them on the front of a t shirt. We don't know what those laws are yet  but that's what we're after. The second crazy idea is that consciousness might be universal. Every system might have some degree of consciousness. This view is sometimes called panpsychism  pan for all  psych for mind  every system is conscious  not just humans  dogs  mice  flies  but even Rob Knight's microbes  elementary particles. Even a photon has some degree of consciousness. The idea is not that photons are intelligent or thinking. It's not that a photon is wracked with angst because it's thinking   Aww  I'm always buzzing around near the speed of light. I never get to slow down and smell the roses.  No  not like that. But the thought is maybe photons might have some element of raw  subjective feeling  some primitive precursor to consciousness. This may sound a bit kooky to you. I mean  why would anyone think such a crazy thing  Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea  that consciousness is fundamental. If it's fundamental  like space and time and mass  it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too  the way they are. It's also worth noting that although the idea seems counterintuitive to us  it's much less counterintuitive to people from different cultures  where the human mind is seen as much more continuous with nature. A deeper motivation comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness to physical processing is to link consciousness to information. Wherever there's information processing  there's consciousness. Complex information processing  like in a human  complex consciousness. Simple information processing  simple consciousness. A really exciting thing is in recent years a neuroscientist  Giulio Tononi  has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigorously with a mathematical theory. He has a mathematical measure of information integration which he calls phi  measuring the amount of information integrated in a system. And he supposes that phi goes along with consciousness. So in a human brain  incredibly large amount of information integration  high degree of phi  a whole lot of consciousness. In a mouse  medium degree of information integration  still pretty significant  pretty serious amount of consciousness. But as you go down to worms  microbes  particles  the amount of phi falls off. The amount of information integration falls off  but it's still non zero. On Tononi's theory  there's still going to be a non zero degree of consciousness. In effect  he's proposing a fundamental law of consciousness  high phi  high consciousness. Now  I don't know if this theory is right  but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now in the science of consciousness  and it's been used to integrate a whole range of scientific data  and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t shirt. Another final motivation is that panpsychism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world. Physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract. It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations  but it doesn't tell us about the reality that underlies it. As Stephen Hawking puts it  what puts the fire into the equations  Well  on the panpsychist view  you can leave the equations of physics as they are  but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness. That's what physics really is ultimately doing  describing the flux of consciousness. On this view  it's consciousness that puts the fire into the equations. On that view  consciousness doesn't dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra. It's there right at its heart. This view  I think  the panpsychist view  has the potential to transfigure our relationship to nature  and it may have some pretty serious social and ethical consequences. Some of these may be counterintuitive. I used to think I shouldn't eat anything which is conscious  so therefore I should be vegetarian. Now  if you're a panpsychist and you take that view  you're going to go very hungry. So I think when you think about it  this tends to transfigure your views  whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral considerations  not so much the fact of consciousness  but the degree and the complexity of consciousness. It's also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems  like computers. What about the artificially intelligent system in the movie  Her   Samantha  Is she conscious  Well  if you take the informational  panpsychist view  she certainly has complicated information processing and integration  so the answer is very likely yes  she is conscious. If that's right  it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off. Finally  you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups  the planet. Does Canada have its own consciousness  Or at a more local level  does an integrated group like the audience at a TED conference  are we right now having a collective TED consciousness  an inner movie for this collective TED group which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts  I don't know the answer to that question  but I think it's at least one worth taking seriously. Okay  so this panpsychist vision  it is a radical one  and I don't know that it's correct. I'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea  that consciousness is fundamental  than about the second one  that it's universal. I mean  the view raises any number of questions  has any number of challenges  like how do those little bits of consciousness add up to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love. If we can answer those questions  then I think we're going to be well on our way to a serious theory of consciousness. If not  well  this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy. We can't expect to solve it overnight. But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually. Understanding consciousness is a real key  I think  both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves. It may just take the right crazy idea. Thank you. The first time I stood in the operating room and watched a real surgery  I had no idea what to expect. I was a college student in engineering. I thought it was going to be like on TV. Ominous music playing in the background  beads of sweat pouring down the surgeon's face. But it wasn't like that at all. There was music playing on this day  I think it was Madonna's greatest hits.  Laughter  And there was plenty of conversation  not just about the patient's heart rate  but about sports and weekend plans. And since then  the more surgeries I watched  the more I realized this is how it is. In some weird way  it's just another day at the office. But every so often the music gets turned down  everyone stops talking  and stares at exactly the same thing. And that's when you know that something absolutely critical and dangerous is happening. The first time I saw that I was watching a type of surgery called laparoscopic surgery And for those of you who are unfamiliar  laparoscopic surgery  instead of the large open incision you might be used to with surgery  a laparoscopic surgery is where the surgeon creates these three or more small incisions in the patient. And then inserts these long  thin instruments and a camera  and actually does the procedure inside the patient. This is great because there's much less risk of infection  much less pain  shorter recovery time. But there is a trade off  because these incisions are created with a long  pointed device called a trocar. And the way the surgeon uses this device is that he takes it and he presses it into the abdomen until it punctures through. And now the reason why  everyone in the operating room was staring at that device on that day was because he had to be absolutely careful not to plunge it through and puncture it into the organs  and blood vessels below. But this problem should seem  pretty familiar to all of you because I'm pretty sure  you've seen it somewhere else. Remember this  You knew that at any second that straw was going to plunge through  and you didn't know if it was  going to go out the other side and straight into your hand  or if you were going to get juice everywhere  but you were terrified. Right  Every single time you did this  you experienced the same fundamental physics that I was watching in the operating room that day. And it turns out it really is a problem. In       the FDA actually came out and said that trocar incisions might  be the most dangerous step in minimally invasive surgery. Again in       we see a paper that says that trocars account for over half of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery. And  oh by the way  this hasn't changed for    years. So when I got to graduate school  this is what I wanted to work on. I was trying to explain to a friend of mine what exactly I was spending my time doing  and I said   It's like when you're drilling through a wall to hang something in your apartment. There's that moment when the drill first punctures through the wall and there's this plunge. Right  And he looked at me and he said   You mean like when they drill  into people's brains   And I said   Excuse me    Laughter  And then I looked it up and they do drill into people's brains. A lot of neurosurgical procedures actually start with a drill incision through the skull. And if the surgeon isn't careful  he can plunge directly into the brain. So this is the moment when I started thinking  okay  cranial drilling  laparoscopic surgery  why not other areas of medicine  Because think about it  when was the last time you went to the doctor and you didn't get stuck with something  Right  So the truth is in medicine puncture is everywhere. And here are just a couple of the procedures that I've found that involve some tissue puncture step. And if we take just three of them   laparoscopic surgery   epidurals  and cranial drilling   these procedures account  for over        complications every year in this country alone. I call that a problem worth solving. So let's take a look at some of the devices that are used in these types of procedures. I mentioned epidurals. This is an epidural needle. It's used to puncture through  the ligaments in the spine and deliver anesthesia during childbirth. Here's a set of bone marrow biopsy tools. These are actually used to burrow into the bone and collect bone marrow or sample bone lesions. Here's a bayonette from the Civil War. If I had told you it was a  medical puncture device you probably would have believed me. Because what's the difference  So  the more I did this research the more I thought there has to be a better way to do this. And for me the key to this problem is that all these different puncture devices share a common set of fundamental physics. So what are those physics  Let's go back to drilling through a wall. So you're applying a force  on a drill towards the wall. And Newton says the wall is going to apply force back  equal and opposite. So  as you drill through the wall  those forces balance. But then there's that moment when the drill first punctures through the other side of the wall  and right at that moment  the wall can't push back anymore. But your brain hasn't reacted  to that change in force. So for that millisecond  or however long it takes you  to react  you're still pushing  and that unbalanced force  causes an acceleration  and that is the plunge. But what if right at the moment of puncture you could pull that tip back  actually oppose the forward acceleration  That's what I set out to do. So imagine you have a device and it's got some kind of sharp tip  to cut through tissue. What's the simplest way  you could pull that tip back  I chose a spring. So when you extend that spring   you extend that tip out so it's ready to puncture tissue  the spring wants to pull the tip back. How do you keep the tip in place until the moment of puncture  I used this mechanism. When the tip of the device is pressed against tissue  the mechanism expands outwards  and wedges in place against the wall. And the friction that's generated locks it in place and prevents the spring from retracting the tip. But right at the moment of puncture  the tissue can't push back on the tip anymore. So the mechanism unlocks  and the spring retracts the tip. Let me show you that  happening in slow motion. This is about       frames a second  and I'd like you to notice the tip that's right there on the bottom   about to puncture through tissue. And you'll see that  right at the moment of puncture  right there  the mechanism unlocks  and retracts that tip back. I want to show it to you again  a little closer up. You're going to see the sharp bladed tip  and right when it punctures  that rubber membrane it's going to disappear into this white blunt sheath. Right there. That happens within four    ths  of a second after puncture. And because this device is designed to address the physics of puncture and not the specifics of cranial drilling or laparoscopic surgery   or another procedure  it's applicable across these different medical disciplines and across different length scales. But it didn't always look like this. This was my first prototype. Yes  those are popsicle sticks  and there's a rubber band at the top. It took about    minutes to do this  but it worked. And it proved to me that my idea worked and it justified the next couple years of work on this project. I worked on this because this problem really fascinated me. It kept me up at night. But I think it should fascinate you too  because I said puncture is everywhere. That means at some point  it's going to be your problem too. That first day in the operating room I never expected to find myself  on the other end of a trocar. But last year  I got appendicitis  when I was visiting Greece. So I was in the hospital in Athens  and the surgeon was telling me he was going to perform  a laparoscopic surgery. He was going to remove my appendix  through these tiny incisions  and he was talking about what I could expect for the recovery  and what was going to happen. He said   Do you have any questions   And I said   Just one  doc. What kind of trocar do you use   So my favorite quote  about laparoscopic surgery comes from a Doctor H. C. Jacobaeus   It is puncture itself that causes risk.  That's my favorite quote  because H.C. Jacobaeus was the first person to ever perform  laparoscopic surgery on humans  and he wrote that in     . This is a problem that's been injuring and even killing people for over     years. So it's easy to think that for every major problem out there there's some team of experts  working around the clock to solve it. The truth is that's not always the case. We have to be better at finding those problems and finding ways to solve them. So if you come across a problem that grabs you  let it keep you up at night. Allow yourself to be fascinated  because there are so many lives to save. I was born in Taiwan. I grew up surrounded by different types of hardware stores  and I like going to night markets. I love the energy of the night markets  the colors  the lights  the toys  and all the unexpected things I find every time I go  things like watermelon with straw antennas or puppies with mohawks. When I was growing up  I liked taking toys apart  any kind of toys I'd find around the house  like my brother's BB gun when he's not home. I also liked to make environments for people to explore and play. In these early installations  I would take plastic sheets  plastic bags  and things I would find in the hardware store or around the house. I would take things like highlighter pen  mix it with water  pump it through plastic tubing  creating these glowing circulatory systems for people to walk through and enjoy. I like these materials because of the way they look  the way they feel  and they're very affordable. I also liked to make devices that work with body parts. I would take camera LED lights and a bungee cord and strap it on my waist and I would videotape my belly button  get a different perspective  and see what it does. I also like to modify household appliances. This is an automatic night light. Some of you might have them at home. I would cut out the light sensor  add an extension line  and use modeling clay  stick it onto the television  and then I would videotape my eye  and using the dark part of my eye tricking the sensor into thinking it's night time  so you turn on the lightbulb. The white of the eye and the eyelid will trick the sensor into thinking it's daytime  and it will shut off the light. I wanted to collect more different types of eyes  so I built this device using bicycle helmets  some lightbulbs and television sets. It would be easier for other people to wear the helmet and record their eyes. This device allows me to symbolically extract other people's eyes  so I have a diversity of eyes to use for my other sculptures. This sculpture has four eyes. Each eye is controlling a different device. This eye is turning itself around in a television. This eye is inflating a plastic tube. This eye is watching a video of another piece being made. And these two eyes are activating glowing water. Many of these pieces are later on shown in museums  biennials  triennial exhibitions around the world. I love science and biology. In       I was doing a research fellowship at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum looking at bioluminous organisms in the oean. I love these creatures. I love the way they look  the way they feel. They're soft  they're slimy  and I was fascinated by the way they use light in their environment  either to attract mates  for self defense  or to attract food. This research inspired my work in many different ways  things like movement or different light patterns. So I started gathering a lot of different types of material in my studio and just experimenting and trying this out  trying that out  and seeing what types of creatures I can come up with. I used a lot of computer cooling fans and just kind of put them together and see what happens. This is an       square foot installation composed of many different creatures  some hanging from the ceiling and some resting on the floor. From afar  they look alien like  but when you look closer  they're all made out of black garbage bags or Tupperware containers. I'd like to share with you how ordinary things can become something magical and wondrous. Thank you. I'd like to introduce you to an organism  a slime mold  Physarum polycephalum. It's a mold with an identity crisis  because it's not a mold  so let's get that straight to start with. It is one of     known slime molds belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba. It is a single celled organism  a cell  that joins together with other cells to form a mass super cell to maximize its resources. So within a slime mold you might find thousands or millions of nuclei  all sharing a cell wall  all operating as one entity. In its natural habitat  you might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands  eating rotting vegetation  but you might equally find it in research laboratories  classrooms  and even artists' studios. I first came across the slime mold about five years ago. A microbiologist friend of mine gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it and told me to go home and play with it. The only instructions I was given  that it likes it dark and damp and its favorite food is porridge oats. I'm an artist who's worked for many years with biology  with scientific processes  so living material is not uncommon for me. I've worked with plants  bacteria  cuttlefish  fruit flies. So I was keen to get my new collaborator home to see what it could do. So I took it home and I watched. I fed it a varied diet. I observed as it networked. It formed a connection between food sources. I watched it leave a trail behind it  indicating where it had been. And I noticed that when it was fed up with one petri dish  it would escape and find a better home. I captured my observations through time lapse photography. Slime mold grows at about one centimeter an hour  so it's not really ideal for live viewing unless there's some form of really extreme meditation  but through the time lapse  I could observe some really interesting behaviors. For instance  having fed on a nice pile of oats  the slime mold goes off to explore new territories in different directions simultaneously. When it meets itself  it knows it's already there  it recognizes it's there  and instead retreats back and grows in other directions. I was quite impressed by this feat  at how what was essentially just a bag of cellular slime could somehow map its territory  know itself  and move with seeming intention. I found countless scientific studies  research papers  journal articles  all citing incredible work with this one organism  and I'm going to share a few of those with you. For example  a team in Hokkaido University in Japan filled a maze with slime mold. It joined together and formed a mass cell. They introduced food at two points  oats of course  and it formed a connection between the food. It retracted from empty areas and dead ends. There are four possible routes through this maze  yet time and time again  the slime mold established the shortest and the most efficient route. Quite clever. The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold had a primitive form of intelligence. Another study exposed cold air at regular intervals to the slime mold. It didn't like it. It doesn't like it cold. It doesn't like it dry. They did this at repeat intervals  and each time  the slime mold slowed down its growth in response. However  at the next interval  the researchers didn't put the cold air on  yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation of it happening. It somehow knew that it was about the time for the cold air that it didn't like. The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold was able to learn. A third experiment  the slime mold was invited to explore a territory covered in oats. It fans out in a branching pattern. As it goes  each food node it finds  it forms a network  a connection to  and keeps foraging. After    hours  it established quite a firm network between the different oats. Now there's nothing remarkable in this until you learn that the center oat that it started from represents the city of Tokyo  and the surrounding oats are suburban railway stations. The slime mold had replicated the Tokyo transport network    Laughter    a complex system developed over time by community dwellings  civil engineering  urban planning. What had taken us well over     years took the slime mold just over a day. The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold can form efficient networks and solve the traveling salesman problem. It is a biological computer. As such  it has been mathematically modeled  algorithmically analyzed. It's been sonified  replicated  simulated. World over  teams of researchers are decoding its biological principles to understand its computational rules and applying that learning to the fields of electronics  programming and robotics. So the question is  how does this thing work  It doesn't have a central nervous system. It doesn't have a brain  yet it can perform behaviors that we associate with brain function. It can learn  it can remember  it can solve problems  it can make decisions. So where does that intelligence lie  So this is a microscopy  a video I shot  and it's about     times magnification  sped up about    times  and inside the slime mold  there is a rhythmic pulsing flow  a vein like structure carrying cellular material  nutrients and chemical information through the cell  streaming first in one direction and then back in another. And it is this continuous  synchronous oscillation within the cell that allows it to form quite a complex understanding of its environment  but without any large scale control center. This is where its intelligence lies. So it's not just academic researchers in universities that are interested in this organism. A few years ago  I set up SliMoCo  the Slime Mould Collective. It's an online  open  democratic network for slime mold researchers and enthusiasts to share knowledge and experimentation across disciplinary divides and across academic divides. The Slime Mould Collective membership is self selecting. People have found the collective as the slime mold finds the oats. And it comprises of scientists and computer scientists and researchers but also artists like me  architects  designers  writers  activists  you name it. It's a very interesting  eclectic membership. Just a few examples  an artist who paints with fluorescent Physarum  a collaborative team who are combining biological and electronic design with  D printing technologies in a workshop  another artist who is using the slime mold as a way of engaging a community to map their area. Here  the slime mold is being used directly as a biological tool  but metaphorically as a symbol for ways of talking about social cohesion  communication and cooperation. Other public engagement activities  I run lots of slime mold workshops  a creative way of engaging with the organism. So people are invited to come and learn about what amazing things it can do  and they design their own petri dish experiment  an environment for the slime mold to navigate so they can test its properties. Everybody takes home a new pet and is invited to post their results on the Slime Mould Collective. And the collective has enabled me to form collaborations with a whole array of interesting people. I've been working with filmmakers on a feature length slime mold documentary  and I stress feature length  which is in the final stages of edit and will be hitting your cinema screens very soon. It's also enabled me to conduct what I think is the world's first human slime mold experiment. This is part of an exhibition in Rotterdam last year. We invited people to become slime mold for half an hour. So we essentially tied people together so they were a giant cell  and invited them to follow slime mold rules. You have to communicate through oscillations  no speaking. You have to operate as one entity  one mass cell  no egos  and the motivation for moving and then exploring the environment is in search of food. So a chaotic shuffle ensued as this bunch of strangers tied together with yellow ropes wearing  Being Slime Mold  t shirts wandered through the museum park. When they met trees  they had to reshape their connections and reform as a mass cell through not speaking. This is a ludicrous experiment in many  many ways. This isn't hypothesis driven. We're not trying to prove  demonstrate anything. But what it did provide us was a way of engaging a broad section of the public with ideas of intelligence  agency  autonomy  and provide a playful platform for discussions about the things that ensued. One of the most exciting things about this experiment was the conversation that happened afterwards. An entirely spontaneous symposium happened in the park. People talked about the human psychology  of how difficult it was to let go of their individual personalities and egos. Other people talked about bacterial communication. Each person brought in their own individual interpretation  and our conclusion from this experiment was that the people of Rotterdam were highly cooperative  especially when given beer. We didn't just give them oats. We gave them beer as well. But they weren't as efficient as the slime mold  and the slime mold  for me  is a fascinating subject matter. It's biologically fascinating  it's computationally interesting  but it's also a symbol  a way of engaging with ideas of community  collective behavior  cooperation. A lot of my work draws on the scientific research  so this pays homage to the maze experiment but in a different way. And the slime mold is also my working material. It's a coproducer of photographs  prints  animations  participatory events. Whilst the slime mold doesn't choose to work with me  exactly  it is a collaboration of sorts. I can predict certain behaviors by understanding how it operates  but I can't control it. The slime mold has the final say in the creative process. And after all  it has its own internal aesthetics. These branching patterns that we see we see across all forms  scales of nature  from river deltas to lightning strikes  from our own blood vessels to neural networks. There's clearly significant rules at play in this simple yet complex organism  and no matter what our disciplinary perspective or our mode of inquiry  there's a great deal that we can learn from observing and engaging with this beautiful  brainless blob.

You have now completed the test. You are all human. I would like to share with you a new model of higher education  a model that  once expanded  can enhance the collective intelligence of millions of creative and motivated individuals that otherwise would be left behind. Look at the world. Pick up a place and focus on it. You will find humans chasing higher education. Let's meet some of them. Patrick. Patrick was born in Liberia to a family of    children. During the civil war  he and his family were forced to flee to Nigeria. There  in spite of his situation  he graduated high school with nearly perfect grades. He wanted to continue to higher education  but due to his family living on the poverty line  he was soon sent to South Africa to work and send back money to feed his family. Patrick never gave up his dream of higher education. Late at night  after work  he surfed the Net looking for ways to study. Meet Debbie. Debbie is from Florida. Her parents didn't go to college  and neither did any of her siblings. Debbie has worked all her life  pays taxes  supports herself month to month  proud of the American dream  a dream that just won't be complete without higher education. But Debbie doesn't have the savings for higher education. She can't pay the tuition. Neither could she leave work. Meet Wael. Wael is from Syria. He's firsthand experiencing the misery  fear and failure imposed on his country. He's a big believer in education. He knew that if he would find an opportunity for higher education  an opportunity to get ahead of the rest  he has a better chance to survive in a world turned upside down. The higher education system failed Patrick  Debbie and Wael  exactly as it is failing millions of potential students  millions that graduate high school  millions that are qualified for higher education  millions that want to study yet cannot access for various reasons. First  financial. Universities are expensive. We all know it. In large parts of the world  higher education is unattainable for an average citizen. This is probably the biggest problem facing our society. Higher education stopped being a right for all and became a privilege for the few. Second  cultural. Students who are qualified for higher education  can afford  want to study  cannot because it is not decent  it is not a place for a woman. This is the story of countless women in Africa  for example  prevented from higher education because of cultural barriers. And here comes the third reason  UNESCO stated that in           million students will be deprived from higher education simply because there will not be enough seats to accommodate them  to meet the demand. They will take a placement test  they will pass it  but they still won't have access because there are no places available. These are the reasons I founded University of the People  a nonprofit  tuition free  degree granting university to give an alternative  to create an alternative to those who have no other  an alternative that will be affordable and scalable  an alternative that will disrupt the current education system  open the gates to higher education for every qualified student regardless of what they earn  where they live  or what society says about them. Patrick  Debbie and Wael are only three examples out of the       accepted students from     countries. We    Applause    Thank you. We didn't need to reinvent the wheel. We just looked at what wasn't working and used the amazing power of the Internet to get around it. We set out to build a model that will cut down almost entirely the cost of higher education  and that's how we did it. First  bricks and mortar cost money. Universities have expenses that virtual universities don't. We don't need to pass these expenses onto our students. They don't exist. We also don't need to worry about capacity. There are no limits of seats in virtual university. Actually  nobody needs to stand at the back of the lecture hall. Textbooks is also something our students don't need to buy. By using open educational resources and the generosity of professors who are putting their material free and accessible  we don't need to send our students to buy textbooks. All of our materials come free. Even professors  the most expensive line in any university balance sheet  come free to our students  over       of them  including presidents  vice chancellors  professors and academic advisors from top universities such as NYU  Yale  Berkeley and Oxford  came on board to help our students. Finally  it's our belief in peer to peer learning. We use this sound pedagogical model to encourage our students from all over the world to interact and study together and also to reduce the time our professors need to labor over class assignments. If the Internet has made us a global village  this model can develop its future leadership. Look how we do it. We only offer two programs  business administration and computer science  the two programs that are most in demand worldwide  the two programs that are likeliest to help our students find a job. When our students are accepted  they are placed in a small classroom of    to    students to ensure that those who need personalized attention get it. Moreover  for every nine weeks' course  they meet a new peer  a whole new set of students from all over the world. Every week  when they go into the classroom  they find the lecture notes of the week  the reading assignment  the homework assignment  and the discussion question  which is the core of our studies. Every week  every student must contribute to the class discussion and also must comment on the contribution of others. This way  we open our students' minds  we develop a positive shift in attitude toward different cultures. By the end of each week  the students take a quiz  hand in their homework  which are assessed by their peers under the supervision of the instructors  get a grade  move to the next week. By the end of the course  they take the final exam  get a grade  and follow to the next course. We opened the gates for higher education for every qualified student. Every student with a high school diploma  sufficient English and Internet connection can study with us. We don't use audio. We don't use video. Broadband is not necessary. Any student from any part of the world with any Internet connection can study with us. We are tuition free. All we ask our students to cover is the cost of their exams      dollars per exam. A full time bachelor degree student taking    courses  will pay       dollars a year        dollars for the entire degree  and for those who cannot afford even this  we offer them a variety of scholarships. It is our mission that nobody will be left behind for financial reasons. With       students in       this model is financially sustainable. Five years ago  it was a vision. Today  it is a reality. Last month  we got the ultimate academic endorsement to our model. University of the People is now fully accredited. Thank you. With this accreditation  it's our time now to scale up. We have demonstrated that our model works. I invite universities and  even more important  developing countries' governments  to replicate this model to ensure that the gates of higher education will open widely. A new era is coming  an era that will witness the disruption of the higher education model as we know it today  from being a privilege for the few to becoming a basic right  affordable and accessible for all. Thank you. What do you think of when I say the word  design   You probably think of things like this  finely crafted objects that you can hold in your hand  or maybe logos and posters and maps that visually explain things  classic icons of timeless design. But I'm not here to talk about that kind of design. I want to talk about the kind that you probably use every day and may not give much thought to  designs that change all the time and that live inside your pocket. I'm talking about the design of digital experiences and specifically the design of systems that are so big that their scale can be hard to comprehend. Consider the fact that Google processes over one billion search queries every day  that every minute  over     hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube. That's more in a single day than all three major U.S. networks broadcast in the last five years combined. And Facebook transmitting the photos  messages and stories of over  .   billion people. That's almost half of the Internet population  and a sixth of humanity. These are some of the products that I've helped design over the course of my career  and their scale is so massive that they've produced unprecedented design challenges. But what is really hard about designing at scale is this  It's hard in part because it requires a combination of two things  audacity and humility   audacity to believe that the thing that you're making is something that the entire world wants and needs  and humility to understand that as a designer  it's not about you or your portfolio  it's about the people that you're designing for  and how your work just might help them live better lives. Now  unfortunately  there's no school that offers the course Designing for Humanity    . I and the other designers who work on these kinds of products have had to invent it as we go along  and we are teaching ourselves the emerging best practices of designing at scale  and today I'd like share some of the things that we've learned over the years. Now  the first thing that you need to know about designing at scale is that the little things really matter. Here's a really good example of how a very tiny design element can make a big impact. The team at Facebook that manages the Facebook  Like  button decided that it needed to be redesigned. The button had kind of gotten out of sync with the evolution of our brand and it needed to be modernized. Now you might think  well  it's a tiny little button  it probably is a pretty straightforward  easy design assignment  but it wasn't. Turns out  there were all kinds of constraints for the design of this button. You had to work within specific height and width parameters. You had to be careful to make it work in a bunch of different languages  and be careful about using fancy gradients or borders because it has to degrade gracefully in old web browsers. The truth is  designing this tiny little button was a huge pain in the butt. Now  this is the new version of the button  and the designer who led this project estimates that he spent over     hours redesigning this button over the course of months. Now  why would we spend so much time on something so small  It's because when you're designing at scale  there's no such thing as a small detail. This innocent little button is seen on average    billion times a day and on over  .  million websites. It's one of the single most viewed design elements ever created. Now that's a lot of pressure for a little button and the designer behind it  but with these kinds of products  you need to get even the tiny things right. Now  the next thing that you need to understand is how to design with data. Now  when you're working on products like this  you have incredible amounts of information about how people are using your product that you can then use to influence your design decisions  but it's not just as simple as following the numbers. Let me give you an example so that you can understand what I mean. Facebook has had a tool for a long time that allowed people to report photos that may be in violation of our community standards  things like spam and abuse. And there were a ton of photos reported  but as it turns out  only a small percentage were actually in violation of those community standards. Most of them were just your typical party photo. Now  to give you a specific hypothetical example  let's say my friend Laura hypothetically uploads a picture of me from a drunken night of karaoke. This is purely hypothetical  I can assure you. Now  incidentally  you know how some people are kind of worried that their boss or employee is going to discover embarrassing photos of them on Facebook  Do you know how hard that is to avoid when you actually work at Facebook  So anyway  there are lots of these photos being erroneously reported as spam and abuse  and one of the engineers on the team had a hunch. He really thought there was something else going on and he was right  because when he looked through a bunch of the cases  he found that most of them were from people who were requesting the takedown of a photo of themselves. Now this was a scenario that the team never even took into account before. So they added a new feature that allowed people to message their friend to ask them to take the photo down. But it didn't work. Only    percent of people sent the message to their friend. So the team went back at it. They consulted with experts in conflict resolution. They even studied the universal principles of polite language  which I didn't even actually know existed until this research happened. And they found something really interesting. They had to go beyond just helping people ask their friend to take the photo down. They had to help people express to their friend how the photo made them feel. Here's how the experience works today. So I find this hypothetical photo of myself  and it's not spam  it's not abuse  but I really wish it weren't on the site. So I report it and I say   I'm in this photo and I don't like it   and then we dig deeper. Why don't you like this photo of yourself  And I select  It's embarrassing.  And then I'm encouraged to message my friend  but here's the critical difference. I'm provided specific suggested language that helps me communicate to Laura how the photo makes me feel. Now the team found that this relatively small change had a huge impact. Before  only    percent of people were sending the message  and now    percent were  and surveys showed that people on both sides of the conversation felt better as a result. That same survey showed that    percent of your friends want to know if they've done something to upset you. Now I don't know who the other    percent are  but maybe that's where our  Unfriend  feature can come in handy. So as you can see  these decisions are highly nuanced. Of course we use a lot of data to inform our decisions  but we also rely very heavily on iteration  research  testing  intuition  human empathy. It's both art and science. Now  sometimes the designers who work on these products are called  data driven   which is a term that totally drives us bonkers. The fact is  it would be irresponsible of us not to rigorously test our designs when so many people are counting on us to get it right  but data analytics will never be a substitute for design intuition. Data can help you make a good design great  but it will never made a bad design good. The next thing that you need to understand as a principle is that when you introduce change  you need to do it extraordinarily carefully. Now I often have joked that I spend almost as much time designing the introduction of change as I do the change itself  and I'm sure that we can all relate to that when something that we use a lot changes and then we have to adjust. The fact is  people can become very efficient at using bad design  and so even if the change is good for them in the long run  it's still incredibly frustrating when it happens  and this is particularly true with user generated content platforms  because people can rightfully claim a sense of ownership. It is  after all  their content. Now  years ago  when I was working at YouTube  we were looking for ways to encourage more people to rate videos  and it was interesting because when we looked into the data  we found that almost everyone was exclusively using the highest five star rating  a handful of people were using the lowest one star  and virtually no one was using two  three or four stars. So we decided to simplify into an up down kind of voting binary model. It's going to be much easier for people to engage with. But people were very attached to the five star rating system. Video creators really loved their ratings. Millions and millions of people were accustomed to the old design. So in order to help people prepare themselves for change and acclimate to the new design more quickly  we actually published the data graph sharing with the community the rationale for what we were going to do  and it even engaged the larger industry in a conversation  which resulted in my favorite TechCrunch headline of all time   YouTube Comes to a   Star Realization  Its Ratings Are Useless.  Now  it's impossible to completely avoid change aversion when you're making changes to products that so many people use. Even though we tried to do all the right things  we still received our customary flood of video protests and angry emails and even a package that had to be scanned by security  but we have to remember people care intensely about this stuff  and it's because these products  this work  really  really matters to them. Now  we know that we have to be careful about paying attention to the details  we have to be cognizant about how we use data in our design process  and we have to introduce change very  very carefully. Now  these things are all really useful. They're good best practices for designing at scale. But they don't mean anything if you don't understand something much more fundamental. You have to understand who you are designing for. Now  when you set a goal to design for the entire human race  and you start to engage in that goal in earnest  at some point you run into the walls of the bubble that you're living in. Now  in San Francisco  we get a little miffed when we hit a dead cell zone because we can't use our phones to navigate to the new hipster coffee shop. But what if you had to drive four hours to charge your phone because you had no reliable source of electricity  What if you had no access to public libraries  What if your country had no free press  What would these products start to mean to you  This is what Google  YouTube and Facebook look like to most of the world  and it's what they'll look like to most of the next five billion people to come online. Designing for low end cell phones is not glamorous design work  but if you want to design for the whole world  you have to design for where people are  and not where you are. So how do we keep this big  big picture in mind  We try to travel outside of our bubble to see  hear and understand the people we're designing for. We use our products in non English languages to make sure that they work just as well. And we try to use one of these phones from time to time to keep in touch with their reality. So what does it mean to design at a global scale  It means difficult and sometimes exasperating work to try to improve and evolve products. Finding the audacity and the humility to do right by them can be pretty exhausting  and the humility part  it's a little tough on the design ego. Because these products are always changing  everything that I've designed in my career is pretty much gone  and everything that I will design will fade away. But here's what remains  the never ending thrill of being a part of something that is so big  you can hardly get your head around it  and the promise that it just might change the world. Thank you. This year  Germany is celebrating the   th anniversary of the peaceful revolution in East Germany. In       the Communist regime was moved away  the Berlin Wall came down  and one year later  the German Democratic Republic  the GDR  in the East was unified with the Federal Republic of Germany in the West to found today's Germany. Among many other things  Germany inherited the archives of the East German secret police  known as the Stasi. Only two years after its dissolution  its documents were opened to the public  and historians such as me started to study these documents to learn more about how the GDR surveillance state functioned. Perhaps you have watched the movie  The Lives of Others.  This movie made the Stasi known worldwide  and as we live in an age where words such as  surveillance  or  wiretapping  are on the front pages of newspapers  I would like to speak about how the Stasi really worked. At the beginning  let's have a short look at the history of the Stasi  because it's really important for understanding its self conception. Its origins are located in Russia. In       the Russian Communists founded the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter Revolution and Sabotage  shortly Cheka. It was led by Felix Dzerzhinsky. The Cheka was an instrument of the Communists to establish their regime by terrorizing the population and executing their enemies. It evolved later into the well known KGB. The Cheka was the idol of the Stasi officers. They called themselves Chekists  and even the emblem was very similar  as you can see here. In fact  the secret police of Russia was the creator and instructor of the Stasi. When the Red Army occupied East Germany in       it immediately expanded there  and soon it started to train the German Communists to build up their own secret police. By the way  in this hall where we are now  the ruling party of the GDR was founded in     . Five years later  the Stasi was established  and step by step  the dirty job of oppression was handed over to it. For instance  the central jail for political prisoners  which was established by the Russians  was taken over by the Stasi and used until the end of Communism. You see it here. At the beginning  every important step took place under the attendance of the Russians. But the Germans are known to be very effective  so the Stasi grew very quickly  and already in       it had more employees than the Gestapo had  the secret police of Nazi Germany. The number doubled in each decade. In       more than        employees worked for the Stasi. This meant that one employee was responsible for     inhabitants  which was really unique in the world. At the top of this tremendous apparatus  there was one man  Erich Mielke. He ruled the Ministry of State Security for more than    years. He was a scrupulous functionary   in his past  he killed two policemen not far away from here   who in fact personalized the Stasi. But what was so exceptional about the Stasi  Foremost  it was its enormous power  because it united different functions in one organization. First of all  the Stasi was an intelligence service. It used all the imaginable instruments for getting information secretly  such as informers  or tapping phones  as you can see it on the picture here. And it was not only active in East Germany  but all over the world. Secondly  the Stasi was a secret police. It could stop people on the street and arrest them in its own prisons. Thirdly  the Stasi worked as a kind of public prosecutor. It had the right to open preliminary investigations and to interrogate people officially. Last but not least  the Stasi had its own armed forces. More than        soldiers were serving in its so called Guards Regiment. It was founded to crash down protests and uprisings. Due to this concentration of power  the Stasi was called a state in the state. But let's look in more and more detail at the tools of the Stasi. Please keep in mind that at that time the web and smartphones were not yet invented. Of course  the Stasi used all kinds of technical instruments to survey people. Telephones were wiretapped  including the phone of the German chancellor in the West  and often also the apartments. Every day         letters were being opened by these machines. The Stasi also shadowed tens of thousands of people using specially trained agents and secret cameras to document every step one took. In this picture  you can see me as a young man just in front of this building where we are now  photographed by a Stasi agent. The Stasi even collected the smell of people. It stored samples of it in closed jars which were found after the peaceful revolution. For all these tasks  highly specialized departments were responsible. The one which was tapping phone calls was completely separated from the one which controlled the letters  for good reasons  because if one agent quit the Stasi  his knowledge was very small. Contrast that with Snowden  for example. But the vertical specialization was also important to prevent all kinds of empathy with the object of observation. The agent who shadowed me didn't know who I was or why I was surveyed. In fact  I smuggled forbidden books from West to East Germany. But what was even more typical for the Stasi was the use of human intelligence  people who reported secretly to the Stasi. For the Minister of State Security  these so called unofficial employees were the most important tools. From      on  nearly         people collaborated constantly with the Stasi  more than one percent of the population. And in a way  the minister was right  because technical instruments can only register what people are doing  but agents and spies can also report what people are planning to do and what they are thinking. Therefore  the Stasi recruited so many informants. The system of how to get them and how to educate them  as it was called  was very sophisticated. The Stasi had its own university  not far away from here  where the methods were explored and taught to the officers. This guideline gave a detailed description of every step you have to take if you want to convince human beings to betray their fellow citizens. Sometimes it's said that informants were pressured to becoming one  but that's mostly not true  because a forced informant is a bad informant. Only someone who wants to give you the information you need is an effective whistleblower. The main reasons why people cooperated with the Stasi were political conviction and material benefits. The officers also tried to create a personal bond between themselves and the informant  and to be honest  the example of the Stasi shows that it's not so difficult to win someone in order to betray others. Even some of the top dissidents in East Germany collaborated with the Stasi  as for instance Ibrahim B hme. In       he was the leader of the peaceful revolution and he nearly became the first freely elected Prime Minister of the GDR until it came out that he was an informant. The net of spies was really broad. In nearly every institution  even in the churches or in West Germany  there were many of them. I remember telling a leading Stasi officer   If you had sent an informant to me  I would surely have recognized him.  His answer was   We didn't send anyone. We took those who were around you.  And in fact  two of my best friends reported about me to the Stasi. Not only in my case  informers were very close. For example  Vera Lengsfeld  another leading dissident  in her case it was her husband who spied on her. A famous writer was betrayed by his brother. This reminds me of the novel        by George Orwell  where the only apparently trustable person was an informer. But why did the Stasi collect all this information in its archives  The main purpose was to control the society. In nearly every speech  the Stasi minister gave the order to find out who is who  which meant who thinks what. He didn't want to wait until somebody tried to act against the regime. He wanted to know in advance what people were thinking and planning. The East Germans knew  of course  that they were surrounded by informers  in a totalitarian regime that created mistrust and a state of widespread fear  the most important tools to oppress people in any dictatorship. That's why not many East Germans tried to fight against the Communist regime. If yes  the Stasi often used a method which was really diabolic. It was called Zersetzung  and it's described in another guideline. The word is difficult to translate because it means originally  biodegradation.  But actually  it's a quite accurate description. The goal was to destroy secretly the self confidence of people  for example by damaging their reputation  by organizing failures in their work  and by destroying their personal relationships. Considering this  East Germany was a very modern dictatorship. The Stasi didn't try to arrest every dissident. It preferred to paralyze them  and it could do so because it had access to so much personal information and to so many institutions. Detaining someone was used only as a last resort. For this  the Stasi owned    remand prisons  one in every district. Here  the Stasi also developed quite modern methods of detention. Normally  the interrogation officer didn't torture the prisoner. Instead  he used a sophisticated system of psychological pressure in which strict isolation was central. Nearly no prisoner resisted without giving a testimony. If you have the occasion  do visit the former Stasi prison in Berlin and attend a guided tour with a former political prisoner who will explain to you how this worked. One more question needs to be answered  If the Stasi were so well organized  why did the Communist regime collapse  First  in       the leadership in East Germany was uncertain what to do against the growing protest of people. It was especially confused because in the mother country of socialism  the Soviet Union  a more liberal policy took place. In addition  the regime was dependent on the loans from the West. Therefore  no order to crash down the uprising was given to the Stasi. Secondly  in the Communist ideology  there's no place for criticism. Instead  the leadership stuck to the belief that socialism is a perfect system  and the Stasi had to confirm that  of course. The consequence was that despite all the information  the regime couldn't analyze its real problems  and therefore it couldn't solve them. In the end  the Stasi died because of the structures that it was charged with protecting. The ending of the Stasi was something tragic  because these officers were kept busy during the peaceful revolution with only one thing  to destroy the documents they had produced during decades. Fortunately  they had been stopped by human rights activists. That's why today we can use the files to get a better understanding of how a surveillance state functions. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you. Thank you very much. So Hubertus  I want to ask you a couple of questions because I have here Der Spiegel from last week.  Mein Nachbar NSA.  My neighbor  the NSA. And you just told us about my neighbor  the spies and the informant from East Germany. So there is a direct link between these two stories or there isn't  What's your reaction as a historian when you see this  Hubertus Knabe  I think there are several aspects to mention. At first  I think there's a difference of why you are collecting this data. Are you doing that for protecting your people against terrorist attacks  or are you doing that for oppressing your people  So that makes a fundamental difference. But on the other hand  also in a democracy  these instruments can be abused  and that is something where we really have to be aware to stop that  and that also the intelligence services are respecting the rules we have. The third point  probably  we really can be happy that we live in a democracy  because you can be sure that Russia and China are doing the same  but nobody speaks about that because nobody could do that. BG  When the story came out first  last July  last year  you filed a criminal complaint with a German tribunal. Why  HK  Yeah  I did so because of the second point I mentioned  that I think especially in a democracy  the rules are for everybody. They are made for everybody  so it's not allowed that any institution doesn't respect the rules. In the criminal code of Germany  it's written that it's not allowed to tap somebody without the permission of the judge. Fortunately  it's written in the criminal code of Germany  so if it's not respected  then I think an investigation is necessary  and it took a very long time that the public prosecutor of Germany started this  and he started it only in the case of Angela Merkel  and not in the case of all the other people living in Germany. BG  That doesn't surprise me because   because of the story you told. Seen from the outside  I live outside of Germany  and I expected the Germans to react much more strongly  immediately. And instead  the reaction really came only when Chancellor Merkel was revealed as being wiretapped. Why so  HK  I take it as a good sign  because people feel secure in this democracy. They aren't afraid that they will be arrested  and if you leave this hall after the conference  nobody has to be afraid that the secret police is standing out and is arresting you. So that's a good sign  I think. People are not really scared  as they could be. But of course  I think  the institutions are responsible to stop illegal actions in Germany or wherever they happen. BG  A personal question  and this is the last one. There has been a debate in Germany about granting asylum to Edward Snowden. Would you be in favor or against  HK  Oh  that's a difficult question  but if you ask me  and if I answer honestly  I would give him the asylum  because I think it was really brave what he did  and he destroyed his whole life and his family and everything. So I think  for these people  we should do something  and especially if you see the German history  where so many people had to escape and they asked for asylum in other countries and they didn't get it  so it would be a good sign to give him asylum. BG  Hubertus  thank you very much. Take a look at this drawing. Can you tell what it is  I'm a molecular biologist by training  and I've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings. They're usually referred to as a model figure  a drawing that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs. This particular drawing is of a process called clathrin mediated endocytosis. It's a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell. There's a problem with this drawing  though  and it's mainly in what it doesn't show. From lots of experiments  from lots of different scientists  we know a lot about what these molecules look like  how they move around in the cell  and that this is all taking place in an incredibly dynamic environment. So in collaboration with a clathrin expert Tomas Kirchhausen  we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that. So we start outside of the cell. Now we're looking inside. Clathrin are these three legged molecules that can self assemble into soccer ball like shapes. Through connections with a membrane  clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble  or a vesicle  that's now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell. Proteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle  making it separate from the rest of the membrane  and now clathrin is basically done with its job  and so proteins are coming in now   we've covered them yellow and orange   that are responsible for taking apart this clathrin cage. And so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again. These processes are too small to be seen directly  even with the best microscopes  so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a hypothesis. Here's another illustration  and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think that the HIV virus gets into and out of cells. And again  this is a vast oversimplification and doesn't begin to show what we actually know about these processes. You might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses. Why  Because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard. I spent months in Hollywood learning  D animation software  and I spend months on each animation  and that's just time that most researchers can't afford. The payoffs can be huge  though. Molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy. And I'm working on a new project now called  The Science of HIV  where I'll be animating the entire life cycle of the HIV virus as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail. The animation will feature data from thousands of researchers collected over decades  data on what this virus looks like  how it's able to infect cells in our body  and how therapeutics are helping to combat infection. Over the years  I found that animations aren't just useful for communicating an idea  but they're also really useful for exploring a hypothesis. Biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study  and with the data we have now  that's just not good enough anymore. The process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas. One researcher I worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were related directly to the animation that she and I worked on together  and in this way  animation can feed back into the research process. I believe that animation can change biology. It can change the way that we communicate with one another  how we explore our data and how we teach our students. But for that change to happen  we need more researchers creating animations  and toward that end  I brought together a team of biologists  animators and programmers to create a new  free  open source software   we call it Molecular Flipbook   that's created just for biologists just to create molecular animations. From our testing  we've found that it only takes    minutes for a biologist who has never touched animation software before to create her first molecular animation of her own hypothesis. We're also building an online database where anyone can view  download and contribute their own animations. We're really excited to announce that the beta version of the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today. We are really excited to see what biologists will create with it and what new insights they're able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures. Thank you. I didn't know when I agreed to do this whether I was expected to talk or to sing. But when I was told that the topic was language  I felt that I had to speak about something for a moment. I have a problem. It's not the worst thing in the world. I'm fine. I'm not on fire. I know that other people in the world have far worse things to deal with  but for me  language and music are inextricably linked through this one thing. And the thing is that I have a stutter. It might seem curious given that I spend a lot of my life on the stage. One would assume that I'm comfortable in the public sphere and comfortable here  speaking to you guys. But the truth is that I've spent my life up until this point and including this point  living in mortal dread of public speaking. Public singing  whole different thing.  Laughter  But we'll get to that in a moment. I've never really talked about it before so explicitly. I think that that's because I've always lived in hope that when I was a grown up  I wouldn't have one. I sort of lived with this idea that when I'm grown  I'll have learned to speak French  and when I'm grown  I'll learn how to manage my money  and when I'm grown  I won't have a stutter  and then I'll be able to public speak and maybe be the prime minister and anything's possible and  you know. So I can talk about it now because I've reached this point  where   I mean  I'm   . I'm pretty sure that I'm grown now. And I'm an adult woman who spends her life as a performer  with a speech impediment. So  I might as well come clean about it. There are some interesting angles to having a stutter. For me  the worst thing that can happen is meeting another stutterer. This happened to me in Hamburg  when this guy  we met and he said   Hello  m m m my name is Joe   and I said   Oh  hello  m m m my name is Meg.  Imagine my horror when I realized he thought I was making fun of him. People think I'm drunk all the time. People think that I've forgotten their name when I hesitate before saying it. And it is a very weird thing  because proper nouns are the worst. If I'm going to use the word  Wednesday  in a sentence  and I'm coming up to the word  and I can feel that I'm going to stutter or something  I can change the word to  tomorrow   or  the day after Tuesday   or something else. It's clunky  but you can get away with it  because over time I've developed this loophole method of using speech where right at the last minute you change the thing and you trick your brain. But with people's names  you can't change them. When I was singing a lot of jazz  I worked a lot with a pianist whose name was Steve. As you can probably gather  S's and T's  together or independently  are my kryptonite. But I would have to introduce the band over this rolling vamp  and when I got around to Steve  I'd often find myself stuck on the  St.  And it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable  and it totally kills the vibe. So after a few instances of this  Steve happily became  Seve   and we got through it that way.  Laughter  I've had a lot of therapy  and a common form of treatment is to use this technique that's called smooth speech  which is where you almost sing everything that you say. You kind of join everything together in this very singsong  kindergarten teacher way  and it makes you sound very serene  like you've had lots of Valium  and everything is calm.  Laughter  That's not actually me. And I do use that. I do. I use it when I have to be on panel shows  or when I have to do radio interviews  when the economy of airtime is paramount. I get through it that way for my job. But as an artist who feels that their work is based solely on a platform of honesty and being real  that feels often like cheating. Which is why before I sing  I wanted to tell you what singing means to me. It's more than making nice sounds  and it's more than making nice songs. It's more than feeling known  or understood. It's more than making you feel the things that I feel. It's not about mythology  or mythologizing myself to you. Somehow  through some miraculous synaptic function of the human brain  it's impossible to stutter when you sing. And when I was younger  that was a method of treatment that worked very well for me  singing  so I did it a lot. And that's why I'm here today. Thank you. Singing for me is sweet relief. It is the only time when I feel fluent. It is the only time when what comes out of my mouth is comprehensively exactly what I intended. So I know that this is a TED Talk  but now i'm going to TED sing. This is a song that I wrote last year. Thank you very much. Thank you.   I would be a beauty     but my nose     is slightly too big     for my face     And I would be a dreamer     but my dream     is slightly too big     for this space     And I would be an angel     but my halo     it pales in the glow     of your grace     And I would be a joker     but that card looks silly when you play     your ace     I'd like to know     Are there stars in hell      And I'd like to know     know if you can tell     that you make me lose everything I know     That I cannot choose to or not let go     And I'd stay forever     but my home     is slightly too far     from this place     And I swear I tried to     slow it down     when I am walking at your pace     But all I could think     idling through the cities     do I look pretty in the rain      And I don't know how someone     quite so lovely     makes me feel ugly     So much shame     And I'd like to know     Are there stars in hell      And I'd like to know     know if you can tell     that you make me lose everything I know     that I cannot choose to or not let go   Thank you very much.  Applause  As a kid I always loved information that I could get from data and the stories that could be told with numbers. I remember  growing up  I'd be frustrated at how my own parents would lie to me using numbers.  Talithia  if I've told you once  I've told you a thousand times.  No dad  you've only told me    times and twice it wasn't my fault.  Laughter  I think that is one of the reasons I got a Ph.D. in statistics. I always wanted to know  what are people trying to hide with numbers  As a statistician  I want people to show me the data so I can decide for myself. Donald and I were pregnant with our third child and we were at about    and a half weeks  what some of you may refer to as being overdue. Statisticians  we call that being within the    percent confidence interval. And at this point in the process we had to come in every couple of days to do a stress test on the baby  and this is just routine  it tests whether or not the baby  is feeling any type of undue stress. And you are rarely  if ever  seen by your actual doctor  just whoever happens to be  working at the hospital that day. So we go in for a stress test and after    minutes the doctor comes out and he says   Your baby is under stress  we need to induce you.  Now  as a statistician  what's my response  Show me the data  So then he proceeds to tell us the baby's heart rate trace went from    minutes  the baby's heart rate was in the normal zone and for two minutes it was in what appeared to be my heart rate zone and I said   Is it possible that maybe this was my heart rate  I was moving around a little bit  it's hard to lay still on your back     weeks pregnant for    minutes. Maybe it was shifting around.  He said   Well  we don't want to take any chances.  I said okay. I said   What if I was at    weeks with this same data  Would your decision be to induce    Well  no  I would wait until you were at least    weeks  but you are almost     there is no reason to leave that baby inside  let's get you a room.  I said   Well  why don't we just do it again  We can collect more data. I can try to be really still for    minutes. We can average the two and see what that means.  Laughter  And he goes   Ma'am  I just don't want you to have a miscarriage.  That makes three of us. And then he says   Your chances of having a miscarriage double when you go past your due date. Let's get you a room.  Wow. So now as a statistician  what's my response  Show me the data  Dude  you're talking chances  I do chances all day long  tell me all about chances. Let's talk chances.  Laughter  Let's talk chances. So I say   Okay  great. Do I go from a    percent  chance to a    percent chance  Where are we here with this miscarriage thing  And he goes   Not quite  but it doubles  and we really just want what's best for the baby.  Undaunted  I try a different angle. I said   Okay  out of       full term pregnant women  how many of them are going to miscarry just before their due date  And then he looks at me and looks at Donald  and he goes  about one in      . I said   Okay  so of those       women  how many are going to miscarry just after their due date    About two.   Laughter  I said   Okay  so you are telling me that my chances go from a  .  percent chance to a  .  percent chance.  Okay  so at this point the data is not convincing us that we need to be induced  and so then we proceed to have a conversation about how inductions lead to a higher rate of Cesarean sections  and if at all  possible we'd like to avoid that. And then I said   And I really don't think my due date is accurate.  And so this really stunned him and he looked sort of puzzled and I said   You may not know this  but pregnancy due dates are calculated assuming that you have a standard    day cycle  and my cycle ranges   sometimes it's     sometimes it's up to      and I have been collecting the data to prove it. And so we ended up leaving the hospital  that day without being induced. We actually had to sign a waiver  to walk out of the hospital. And I'm not advocating that you not listen to your doctors  because even with our first child  we were induced at    weeks  cervical fluid was low. I'm not anti medical intervention. But why were confident to leave that day  Well  we had data that told a different story. We had been collecting data for six years. I had this temperature data  and it told a different story. In fact  we could probably pretty  accurately estimate conception. Yeah  that's a story you want to tell at your kid's wedding reception.  Laughter  I remember like it was yesterday. My temperature was a sizzling   .  degrees as I stared into your father's eyes.  Laughter  Oh  yeah. Twenty two more years  we're telling that story. But we were confident to leave  because we had been collecting data. Now  what does that data look like  Here's a standard chart of a woman's waking body temperature during the course of a cycle. So from the beginning of the menstrual cycle till the beginning of the next. You'll see that the temperature is not random. Clearly there is a low pattern at the beginning of her cycle and then you see this jump and then a higher set of temperatures at the end of her cycle. So what's happening here  What is that data telling you  Well  ladies  at the beginning of our cycle  the hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen causes a suppression of your body temperature. And at ovulation  your body releases an egg and progesterone takes over  pro gestation. And so your body heats up in anticipation of housing this new little fertilized egg. So why this temperature jump  Well  think about when a bird sits on her eggs. Why is she sitting on them  She wants to keep them warm  protect them and keep them warm. Ladies  this is exactly what our bodies do every month  they heat up in anticipation of keeping a new little life warm. And if nothing happens  if you are not pregnant  then estrogen takes back over and  that cycle starts all over again. But if you do get pregnant  sometimes you actually see another shift in your temperatures and it stays elevated for those whole nine months. That's why you see those pregnant  women just sweating and hot  because their temperatures are high. Here's a chart that we had about three or four years ago. We were really very excited about this chart. You'll see the low temperature level and then a shift and for about five days  that's about the time it takes for the egg to travel down the fallopian tube and implant  and then you see those temperatures  start to go up a little bit. And in fact  we had a second temperature shift  confirmed with a pregnancy test  that were indeed pregnant with our first child  very exciting. Until a couple of days later I saw some spotting and then I noticed heavy blood flow  and we had in fact had an early stage miscarriage. Had I not been taking my temperature I really would have just thought  my period was late that month  but we actually had data to show that we had miscarried this baby  and even though this data revealed a really unfortunate event in our lives  it was information that we could then take to our doctor. So if there was a fertility issue or some problem  I had data to show  Look  we got pregnant  our temperature shifted  we somehow lost this baby. What is it that we can do to help prevent this problem  And it's not just about temperatures and it's not just about fertility  we can use data about our bodies to tell us a lot of things. For instance  did you know that taking  your temperature can tell you a lot about the condition of your thyroid  So  your thyroid works a lot like  the thermostat in your house. There is an optimal temperature  that you want in your house  you set your thermostat. When it gets too cold in the house  your thermostat kicks in and says   Hey  we need to blow some heat around.  Or if it gets too hot  your thermostat registers   Turn the A.C. on. Cool us off.  That's exactly how your thyroid works in your body. Your thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature for your body. If it gets too cold  your thyroid  says   Hey  we need to heat up.  If it gets too hot  your thyroid cools you down. But what happens when your  thyroid is not functioning well  When it doesn't function  then it shows up in your body temperatures  they tend to be lower than normal or very erratic. And so by collecting this data you can find out information about your thyroid. Now  what is it  if you had a thyroid  problem and you went to the doctor  your doctor would actually test the amount of thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood. Fine. But the problem with that test is it doesn't tell you how active the hormone is in your body. So you might have a lot of hormone present  but it might not be actively working to regulate your body temperature. So just by collecting your temperature every day  you get information about the condition of your thyroid. So  what if you don't want to take  your temperature every day  I advocate that you do  but there are tons of other things you could take. You could take your blood pressure   you could take your weight   yeah  who's excited about taking their weight every day   Laughter  Early on in our marriage  Donald had a stuffy nose and he had been taking a slew of medications to try to relieve his stuffy nose  to no avail. And so  that night he comes and  he wakes me up and he says   Honey  I can't breath out of my nose.  And I roll over and I look  and I said    Well  can you breath out of your mouth   And he goes   Yes  but I can't breath out of my nose   And so like any good wife  I rush him to the emergency room at   o'clock in the morning. And the whole time I'm driving and I'm thinking  you can't die on me now. We just got married  people will think I killed you   Laughter  And so  we get to the emergency  room  and the nurse sees us  and he can't breath out of his nose  and so she brings us to the back and the doctor says   What seems to be the problem   and  he goes   I can't breath out of my nose.  And he said   You can't breath out of your nose  No  but he can breath out of his mouth.  Laughter  He takes a step back and he looks at both of us and he says  Sir  I think I know the problem. You're having a heart attack. I'm going to order an EKG and a CAT scan for you immediately.  And we are thinking  no  no  no. It's not a heart attack. He can breathe  just out of his mouth. No  no  no  no  no. And so we go back and forth with this doctor because we think this is the incorrect diagnosis  and he's like   No really  it'll be fine  just calm down.  And I'm thinking  how do you calm down   But I don't think he's having a heart attack. And so fortunately for us  this  doctor was at the end of the shift. So this new doctor comes in  he sees us clearly distraught  with a husband who can't breath out of his nose.  Laughter  And he starts asking us questions. He says   Well  do you two exercise   We ride our bikes  we go to the gym occasionally. We move around. And he says   What were you doing  just before you came here   I'm thinking  I was sleeping  honestly. But okay  what was Donald doing just before  So Donald goes into this slew  of medications he was taking. He lists   I took this decongestant  and then I took this nasal spray   and then all of a sudden a lightbulb goes off and he says   Oh  You should never mix this  decongestant with this nasal spray. Clogs you up every time. Here  take this one instead.  He gives us a prescription. We're looking at each other  and I looked at the doctor  and I said   Why is it that it seems like you were able to accurately diagnose his condition  but this previous doctor wanted to order an EKG and a CAT scan   And he looks at us and says   Well  when a     pound man walks in the  emergency room and says he can't breath  you assume he's having a heart attack and you ask questions later.  Now  emergency room doctors are  trained to make decisions quickly  but not always accurately. And so had we had some information about our heart health to share with him  maybe we would have gotten a  better diagnosis the first time. I want you to consider the following chart  of systolic blood pressure measurements from October      to July     . You'll see that these measurements start in the prehypertension hypertension zone  but over about the course of a year and a half they move into the normal zone. This is about the heart rate of a healthy    year old. What story is this data telling you  Obviously it's the data from someone who's made a drastic transformation  and fortunately for us  that person  happens to be here today. So that     pound guy that walked  into the emergency room with me is now an even sexier and healthier     pound guy  and that's his blood pressure trace. So over the course of that year and a half Donald's eating changed and our exercise regimen changed  and his heart rate responded  his blood pressure responded to that change that he made in his body. So what's the take home message that I want you to leave with today  By taking ownership of your data just like we've done  just by taking this daily measurements about yourself  you become the expert on your body. You become the authority. It's not hard to do. You don't have to have a Ph.D. in statistics to be an expert in yourself. You don't have to have a medical degree to be your body's expert. Medical doctors  they're experts on the population  but you are the expert on yourself. And so when two of you come together  when two experts come together  the two of you are able to make a better decision than just your doctor alone. Now that you understand the power of information that you can get through personal data collection  I'd like you all to stand and raise your right hand. Yes  get it up. I challenge you to take ownership of your data. And today  I hereby confer upon you a TEDx associate's degree in elementary statistics with a concentration in time dependent data analysis with all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto. And so the next time you are in your doctor's office  as newly inducted statisticians  what should always be your response  Audience  Show me the data   Talithia Williams  I can't hear you  Audience  Show me the data  TW  One more time  Audience  Show me the data  TW  Show me the data. Thank you. You probably don't know me  but I am one of those .   percenters that you hear about and read about  and I am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat. And tonight  what I would like to do is speak directly to other plutocrats  to my people  because it feels like it's time for us all to have a chat. Like most plutocrats  I too am a proud and unapologetic capitalist. I have founded  cofounded or funded over    companies across a range of industries. I was the first non family investor in Amazon.com. I cofounded a company called aQuantive that we sold to Microsoft for  .  billion dollars. My friends and I  we own a bank. I tell you this    Laughter    unbelievable  right  I tell you this to show that my life is like most plutocrats. I have a broad perspective on capitalism and business  and I have been rewarded obscenely for that with a life that most of you all can't even imagine  multiple homes  a yacht  my own plane  etc.  etc.  etc. But let's be honest  I am not the smartest person you've ever met. I am certainly not the hardest working. I was a mediocre student. I'm not technical at all. I can't write a word of code. Truly  my success is the consequence of spectacular luck  of birth  of circumstance and of timing. But I am actually pretty good at a couple of things. One  I have an unusually high tolerance for risk  and the other is I have a good sense  a good intuition about what will happen in the future  and I think that that intuition about the future is the essence of good entrepreneurship. So what do I see in our future today  you ask  I see pitchforks  as in angry mobs with pitchforks  because while people like us plutocrats are living beyond the dreams of avarice  the other    percent of our fellow citizens are falling farther and farther behind. In       the top one percent of Americans shared about eight percent of national  income   while the bottom    percent of Americans shared    percent. Thirty years later  today  the top one percent shares over    percent of national  income   while the bottom    percent of Americans share    or   . If the trend continues  the top one percent will share over    percent of national  income  in another    years  while the bottom    percent of Americans will share just six. You see  the problem isn't that we have some inequality. Some inequality is necessary for a high functioning capitalist democracy. The problem is that inequality is at historic highs today and it's getting worse every day. And if wealth  power  and income continue to concentrate at the very tippy top  our society will change from a capitalist democracy to a neo feudalist rentier society like   th century France. That was France before the revolution and the mobs with the pitchforks. So I have a message for my fellow plutocrats and zillionaires and for anyone who lives in a gated bubble world  Wake up. Wake up. It cannot last. Because if we do not do something to fix the glaring economic inequities in our society  the pitchforks will come for us  for no free and open society can long sustain this kind of rising economic inequality. It has never happened. There are no examples. You show me a highly unequal society  and I will show you a police state or an uprising. The pitchforks will come for us if we do not address this. It's not a matter of if  it's when. And it will be terrible when they come for everyone  but particularly for people like us plutocrats. I know I must sound like some liberal do gooder. I'm not. I'm not making a moral argument that economic inequality is wrong. What I am arguing is that rising economic inequality is stupid and ultimately self defeating. Rising inequality doesn't just increase our risks from pitchforks  but it's also terrible for business too. So the model for us rich guys should be Henry Ford. When Ford famously introduced the    day  which was twice the prevailing wage at the time  he didn't just increase the productivity of his factories  he converted exploited autoworkers who were poor into a thriving middle class who could now afford to buy the products that they made. Ford intuited what we now know is true  that an economy is best understood as an ecosystem and characterized by the same kinds of feedback loops you find in a natural ecosystem  a feedback loop between customers and businesses. Raising wages increases demand  which increases hiring  which in turn increases wages and demand and profits  and that virtuous cycle of increasing prosperity is precisely what is missing from today's economic recovery. And this is why we need to put behind us the trickle down policies that so dominate both political parties and embrace something I call middle out economics. Middle out economics rejects the neoclassical economic idea that economies are efficient  linear  mechanistic  that they tend towards equilibrium and fairness  and instead embraces the   st century idea that economies are complex  adaptive  ecosystemic  that they tend away from equilibrium and toward inequality  that they're not efficient at all but are effective if well managed. This   st century perspective allows you to clearly see that capitalism does not work by  efficiently  allocating existing resources. It works by  efficiently  creating new solutions to human problems. The genius of capitalism is that it is an evolutionary solution finding system. It rewards people for solving other people's problems. The difference between a poor society and a rich society  obviously  is the degree to which that society has generated solutions in the form of products for its citizens. The sum of the solutions that we have in our society really is our prosperity  and this explains why companies like Google and Amazon and Microsoft and Apple and the entrepreneurs who created those companies have contributed so much to our nation's prosperity. This   st century perspective also makes clear that what we think of as economic growth is best understood as the rate at which we solve problems. But that rate is totally dependent upon how many problem solvers   diverse  able problem solvers   we have  and thus how many of our fellow citizens actively participate  both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions  and as customers who consume them. But this maximizing participation thing doesn't happen by accident. It doesn't happen by itself. It requires effort and investment  which is why all highly prosperous capitalist democracies are characterized by massive investments in the middle class and the infrastructure that they depend on. We plutocrats need to get this trickle down economics thing behind us  this idea that the better we do  the better everyone else will do. It's not true. How could it be  I earn       times the median wage  but I do not buy       times as much stuff  do I  I actually bought two pairs of these pants  what my partner Mike calls my manager pants. I could have bought       pairs  but what would I do with them   Laughter  How many haircuts can I get  How often can I go out to dinner  No matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get  we can never drive a great national economy. Only a thriving middle class can do that. There's nothing to be done  my plutocrat friends might say. Henry Ford was in a different time. Maybe we can't do some things. Maybe we can do some things. June           Bloomberg published an article I wrote called  The Capitalist s Case for a     Minimum Wage.  The good people at Forbes magazine  among my biggest admirers  called it  Nick Hanauer's near insane proposal.  And yet  just     days after that article was published  Seattle's Mayor Ed Murray signed into law an ordinance raising the minimum wage in Seattle to    dollars an hour  more than double what the prevailing federal   .   rate is. How did this happen  reasonable people might ask. It happened because a group of us reminded the middle class that they are the source of growth and prosperity in capitalist economies. We reminded them that when workers have more money  businesses have more customers  and need more employees. We reminded them that when businesses pay workers a living wage  taxpayers are relieved of the burden of funding the poverty programs like food stamps and medical assistance and rent assistance that those workers need. We reminded them that low wage workers make terrible taxpayers  and that when you raise the minimum wage for all businesses  all businesses benefit yet all can compete. Now the orthodox reaction  of course  is raising the minimum wage costs jobs. Right  Your politician's always echoing that trickle down idea by saying things like   Well  if you raise the price of employment  guess what happens  You get less of it.  Are you sure  Because there's some contravening evidence. Since       the wages of CEOs in our country have gone from about    times the median wage to     times. That's raising the price of employment. And yet  to my knowledge  I have never seen a company outsource its CEO's job  automate their job  export the job to China. In fact  we appear to be employing more CEOs and senior managers than ever before. So too for technology workers and financial services workers  who earn multiples of the median wage and yet we employ more and more of them  so clearly you can raise the price of employment and get more of it. I know that most people think that the     minimum wage is this insane  risky economic experiment. We disagree. We believe that the     minimum wage in Seattle is actually the continuation of a logical economic policy. It is allowing our city to kick your city's ass. Because  you see  Washington state already has the highest minimum wage of any state in the nation. We pay all workers   .    which is almost    percent more than the federal minimum of  .    but crucially      percent more than the federal tipped minimum of  .  . If trickle down thinkers were right  then Washington state should have massive unemployment. Seattle should be sliding into the ocean. And yet  Seattle is the fastest growing big city in the country. Washington state is generating small business jobs at a higher rate than any other major state in the nation. The restaurant business in Seattle  Booming. Why  Because the fundamental law of capitalism is  when workers have more money  businesses have more customers and need more workers. When restaurants pay restaurant workers enough so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants  that's not bad for the restaurant business. That's good for it  despite what some restaurateurs may tell you. Is it more complicated than I'm making out  Of course it is. There are a lot of dynamics at play. But can we please stop insisting that if low wage workers earn a little bit more  unemployment will skyrocket and the economy will collapse  There is no evidence for it. The most insidious thing about trickle down economics is not the claim that if the rich get richer  everyone is better off. It is the claim made by those who oppose any increase in the minimum wage that if the poor get richer  that will be bad for the economy. This is nonsense. So can we please dispense with this rhetoric that says that rich guys like me and my plutocrat friends made our country  We plutocrats know  even if we don't like to admit it in public  that if we had been born somewhere else  not here in the United States  we might very well be just some dude standing barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit. It's not that they don't have good entrepreneurs in other places  even very  very poor places. It's just that that's all that those entrepreneurs' customers can afford. So here's an idea for a new kind of economics  a new kind of politics that I call new capitalism. Let's acknowledge that capitalism beats the alternatives  but also that the more people we include  both as entrepreneurs and as customers  the better it works. Let's by all means shrink the size of government  but not by slashing the poverty programs  but by ensuring that workers are paid enough so that they actually don't need those programs. Let's invest enough in the middle class to make our economy fairer and more inclusive  and by fairer  more truly competitive  and by more truly competitive  more able to generate the solutions to human problems that are the true drivers of growth and prosperity. Capitalism is the greatest social technology ever invented for creating prosperity in human societies  if it is well managed  but capitalism  because of the fundamental multiplicative dynamics of complex systems  tends towards  inexorably  inequality  concentration and collapse. The work of democracies is to maximize the inclusion of the many in order to create prosperity  not to enable the few to accumulate money. Government does create prosperity and growth  by creating the conditions that allow both entrepreneurs and their customers to thrive. Balancing the power of capitalists like me and workers isn't bad for capitalism. It's essential to it. Programs like a reasonable minimum wage  affordable healthcare  paid sick leave  and the progressive taxation necessary to pay for the important infrastructure necessary for the middle class like education  R and D  these are indispensable tools shrewd capitalists should embrace to drive growth  because no one benefits from it like us. Many economists would have you believe that their field is an objective science. I disagree  and I think that it is equally a tool that humans use to enforce and encode our social and moral preferences and prejudices about status and power  which is why plutocrats like me have always needed to find persuasive stories to tell everyone else about why our relative positions are morally righteous and good for everyone  like  we are indispensable  the job creators  and you are not  like  tax cuts for us create growth  but investments in you will balloon our debt and bankrupt our great country  that we matter  that you don't. For thousands of years  these stories were called divine right. Today  we have trickle down economics. How obviously  transparently self serving all of this is. We plutocrats need to see that the United States of America made us  not the other way around  that a thriving middle class is the source of prosperity in capitalist economies  not a consequence of it. And we should never forget that even the best of us in the worst of circumstances are barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit. Fellow plutocrats  I think it may be time for us to recommit to our country  to commit to a new kind of capitalism which is both more inclusive and more effective  a capitalism that will ensure that America's economy remains the most dynamic and prosperous in the world. Let's secure the future for ourselves  our children and their children. Or alternatively  we could do nothing  hide in our gated communities and private schools  enjoy our planes and yachts   they're fun   and wait for the pitchforks. Thank you. We're seen as the organization that is the bucket for failed social policy. I can't define who comes to us or how long they stay. We get the people for whom nothing else has worked  people who have fallen through all of the other social safety nets. They can't contain them  so we must. That's our job  contain them  control them. Over the years  as a prison system  as a nation  and as a society  we've become very good at that  but that shouldn't make you happy. Today we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country in the world. We have more black men in prison today than were under slavery in     . We house the parents of almost three million of our community's children  and we've become the new asylum  the largest mental health provider in this nation. When we lock someone up  that is no small thing. And yet  we are called the Department of Corrections. Today I want to talk about changing the way we think about corrections. I believe  and my experience tells me  that when we change the way we think  we create new possibilities  or futures  and prisons need a different future. I've spent my entire career in corrections  over    years. I followed my dad into this field. He was a Vietnam veteran. Corrections suited him. He was strong  steady  disciplined. I was not so much any of those things  and I'm sure that worried him about me. Eventually I decided  if I was going to end up in prison  I'd better end up on the right side of the bars  so I thought I'd check it out  take a tour of the place my dad worked  the McNeil Island Penitentiary. Now this was the early '  s  and prisons weren't quite what you see on TV or in the movies. In many ways  it was worse. I walked into a cell house that was five tiers high. There were eight men to a cell. there were     men in that living unit. And just in case you wondered  they shared one toilet in those small confines. An officer put a key in a lockbox  and hundreds of men streamed out of their cells. Hundreds of men streamed out of their cells. I walked away as fast as I could. Eventually I went back and I started as an officer there. My job was to run one of those cell blocks and to control those hundreds of men. When I went to work at our receptions center  I could actually hear the inmates  roiling from the parking lot  shaking cell doors  yelling  tearing up their cells. Take hundreds of volatile people and lock them up  and what you get is chaos. Contain and control   that was our job. One way we learned to do this more effectively was a new type of housing unit called the Intensive Management Unit  IMU  a modern version of a  hole.  We put inmates in cells behind solid steel doors with cuff ports so we could restrain them and feed them. Guess what  It got quieter. Disturbances died down in the general population. Places became safer because those inmates who were most violent or disruptive could now be isolated. But isolation isn't good. Deprive people of social contact and they deteriorate. It was hard getting them out of IMU  for them and for us. Even in prison  it's no small thing to lock someone up. My next assignment was to one of the state's deep end prisons where some of our more violent or disruptive inmates are housed. By then  the industry had advanced a lot  and we had different tools and techniques to manage disruptive behavior. We had beanbag guns and pepper spray and plexiglass shields  flash bangs  emergency response teams. We met violence with force and chaos with chaos. We were pretty good at putting out fires. While I was there  I met two experienced correctional workers who were also researchers  an anthropologist and a sociologist. One day  one of them commented to me and said   You know  you're pretty good at putting out fires. Have you ever thought about how to prevent them   I was patient with them  explaining our brute force approach to making prisons safer. They were patient with me. Out of those conversations grew some new ideas and we started some small experiments. First  we started training our officers in teams rather than sending them one or two at a time to the state training academy. Instead of four weeks of training  we gave them   . Then we experimented with an apprenticeship model where we paired new staff with veteran staff. They both got better at the work. Second  we added verbal de escalation skills into the training continuum and made it part of the use of force continuum. It was the non force use of force. And then we did something even more radical. We trained the inmates on those same skills. We changed the skill set  reducing violence  not just responding to it. Third  when we expanded our facility   we tried a new type of design. Now the biggest and most controversial component of this design  of course  was the toilet. There were no toilets. Now that might not sound significant to you here today  but at the time  it was huge. No one had ever heard of a cell without a toilet. We all thought it was dangerous and crazy. Even eight men to a cell had a toilet. That small detail changed the way we worked. Inmates and staff started interacting more often and openly and developing a rapport. It was easier to detect conflict and intervene before it escalated. The unit was cleaner  quieter  safer and more humane. This was more effective at keeping the peace than any intimidation technique I'd seen to that point. Interacting changes the way you behave  both for the officer and the inmate. We changed the environment and we changed the behavior. Now  just in case I hadn't learned this lesson  they assigned me to headquarters next  and that's where I ran straight up against system change. Now  many things work against system change  politics and politicians  bills and laws  courts and lawsuits  internal politics. System change is difficult and slow  and oftentimes it doesn't take you where you want to go. It's no small thing to change a prison system. So what I did do is I reflected on my earlier experiences and I remembered that when we interacted with offenders  the heat went down. When we changed the environment  the behavior changed. And these were not huge system changes. These were small changes  and these changes created new possibilities. So next  I got reassigned as superintendent of a small prison. And at the same time  I was working on my degree at the Evergreen State College. I interacted with a lot of people who were not like me  people who had different ideas and came from different backgrounds. One of them was a rainforest ecologist. She looked at my small prison and what she saw was a laboratory. We talked and discovered how prisons and inmates could actually help advance science by helping them complete projects they couldn't complete on their own  like repopulating endangered species  frogs  butterflies  endangered prairie plants. At the same time  we found ways to make our operation more efficient through the addition of solar power  rainwater catchment  organic gardening  recycling. This initiative has led to many projects that have had huge system wide impact  not just in our system  but in  other state systems as well  small experiments making a big difference to science  to the community. The way we think about our work changes our work. The project just made my job more interesting and exciting. I was excited. Staff were excited. Officers were excited. Inmates were excited. They were inspired. Everybody wanted to be part of this. They were making a contribution  a difference  one they thought was meaningful and important. Let me be clear on what's going on here  though. Inmates are highly adaptive. They have to be. Oftentimes  they know more about our own systems than the people who run them. And they're here for a reason. I don't see my job as to punish them or forgive them  but I do think they can have decent and meaningful lives even in prison. So that was the question  Could inmates live decent and meaningful lives  and if so  what difference would that make  So I took that question back to the deep end  where some of our most violent offenders are housed. Remember  IMUs are for punishment. You don't get perks there  like programming. That was how we thought. But then we started to realize that if any inmates needed programming  it was these particular inmates. In fact  they needed intensive programming. So we changed our thinking     degrees  and we started looking for new possibilities. What we found was a new kind of chair. Instead of using the chair for punishment  we put it in classrooms. Okay  we didn't forget our responsibility to control  but now inmates could interact safely  face to face with other inmates and staff  and because control was no longer an issue  everybody could focus on other things  like learning. Behavior changed. We changed our thinking  and we changed  what was possible  and this gives me hope. Now  I can't tell you that any of this stuff will work. What I can tell you  though  it is working. Our prisons are getting safer for both staff and inmates  and when our prisons are safe  we can put our energies into a lot more than just controlling. Reducing recidivism may be our ultimate goal  but it's not our only goal. To be honest with you  preventing crime takes so much more from so many more people and institutions. If we rely on just prisons to reduce crime  I'm afraid we'll never get there. But prisons can do some things we never thought they could do. Prisons can be the source of innovation and sustainability  repopulating endangered species and environmental restoration. Inmates can be scientists and beekeepers  dog rescuers. Prisons can be the source of meaningful work and opportunity for staff and the inmates who live there. We can contain and control and provide humane environments. These are not opposing qualities. We can't wait    to    years to find out if this is worth doing. Our strategy is not massive system change. Our strategy is hundreds of small changes that take place in days or months  not years. We need more small pilots where we learn as we go  pilots that change the range of possibility. We need new and better ways to measure impacts on engagement  on interaction  on safe environments. We need more opportunities to participate in and contribute to our communities  your communities. Prisons need to be secure  yes  safe  yes. We can do that. Prisons need to provide humane environments where people can participate  contribute  and learn meaningful lives. We're learning how to do that. That's why I'm hopeful. We don't have to stay stuck in old ideas about prison. We can define that. We can create that. And when we do that thoughtfully and with humanity  prisons can be more than the bucket for failed social policy. Maybe finally  we will earn our title  a department of corrections. Thank you. I'm a teacher and a practitioner of civics in America. Now  I will kindly ask those of you who have just fallen asleep to please wake up.  Laughter  Why is it that the very word  civics  has such a soporific   even a narcoleptic effect on us  I think it's because the very  word signifies something exceedingly virtuous   exceedingly important  and exceedingly boring. Well  I think it's the responsibility of people like us  people who show up for gatherings like this in person or online  in any way we can  to make civics sexy again  as sexy as it was during the American Revolution  as sexy as it was during the Civil Rights Movement. And I believe the way we make civics sexy again is to make explicitly about the teaching of power. The way we do that  I believe  is at the level of the city. This is what I want to talk about today  and I want to start by defining some terms and then I want to describe the scale of the problem I think we face and then suggest the ways that I believe cities can be the seat of the solution. So let me start with some definitions. By civics  I simply mean the art of being a pro social  problem solving contributor in a self governing community. Civics is the art of citizenship  what Bill Gates Sr. calls simply showing up for life  and it encompasses three things  a foundation of values  an understanding of the systems that make the world go round  and a set of skills that allow you to pursue goals and to have others join in that pursuit. And that brings me to my definition of power  which is simply this  the capacity to make others do what you would have them do. It sounds menacing  doesn't it  We don't like to talk about power. We find it scary. We find it somehow evil. We feel uncomfortable naming it. In the culture and mythology of democracy  power resides with the people. Period. End of story. Any further inquiry not necessary and not really that welcome. Power has a negative moral valence. It sounds Machiavellian inherently. It seems inherently evil. But in fact power is no more inherently good or evil than fire or physics. It just is. And power governs how any form of government operates  whether a democracy or a dictatorship. And the problem we face today  here in America in particular  but all around the world  is that far too many people  are profoundly illiterate in power   what it is  who has it  how it operates  how it flows  what part of it is visible   what part of it is not  why some people have it   why that's compounded. And as a result of this illiteracy  those few who do understand how power operates in civic life  those who understand how a bill becomes a law  yes  but also how a friendship  becomes a subsidy  or how a bias becomes a policy  or how a slogan becomes a movement  the people who understand those things wield disproportionate influence  and they're perfectly happy to fill the vacuum created by the ignorance of the great majority. This is why it is so fundamental for us right now to grab hold of this idea of power and to democratize it. One of the things that is so profoundly exciting and challenging about this moment is that as a result of this power illiteracy that is so pervasive  there is a concentration of knowledge  of understanding  of clout. I mean  think about it  How does a friendship become a subsidy  Seamlessly  when a senior government official decides to leave government and become a lobbyist for a private interest and convert his or her relationships into capital for their new masters. How does a bias become a policy  Insidiously  just the way that stop and frisk  for instance  became over time a bureaucratic numbers game. How does a slogan become a movement  Virally  in the way that the Tea Party  for instance  was able to take the  Don't Tread on Me  flag from the American Revolution  or how  on the other side  a band of activists could take a magazine headline   Occupy Wall Street   and turn that into a global meme and movement. The thing is  though  most people aren't looking for and don't want to see these realities. So much of this ignorance  this civic illiteracy  is willful. There are some millennials  for instance  who think the whole business is just sordid. They don't want to have anything to do with politics. They'd rather just opt out and engage in volunteerism. There are some techies out there who believe that the cure all for any power imbalance or power abuse is simply more data  more transparency. There are some on the left who think power resides only with corporations  and some on the right who think power resides only with government  each side blinded by their selective outrage. There are the naive who believe that good things just happen and the cynical who believe that bad things just happen  the fortunate and unfortunate alike who think that their lot is simply what they deserve rather than the eminently alterable result of a prior arrangement  an inherited allocation  of power. As a result of all of this creeping fatalism in public life  we here  particularly in America today  have depressingly low levels of civic knowledge  civic engagement  participation  awareness. The whole business of politics has been effectively subcontracted out to a band of professionals  money people  outreach people  message people  research people. The rest of us are meant to feel like amateurs in the sense of suckers. We become demotivated to learn more about how things work. We begin to opt out. Well  this problem  this challenge  is a thing that we must now confront  and I believe that when you have this kind of disengagement  this willful ignorance  it becomes both a cause and a consequence of this concentration of opportunity of wealth and clout that I was describing a moment ago  this profound civic inequality. This is why it is so important in our time right now to reimagine civics as the teaching of power. Perhaps it's never been more important at any time in our lifetimes. If people don't learn power  people don't wake up  and if they don't wake up  they get left out. Now  part of the art of practicing power means being awake and having a voice  but it also is about having an arena where you can plausibly practice deciding. All of civics boils down to the simple question of who decides  and you have to play that out in a place  in an arena. And this brings me to the third point that I want to make today  which is simply that there is no better arena in our time for the practicing of power than the city. Think about the city where you live  where you're from. Think about a problem in the common life of your city. It can be something small  like where a street lamp should go  or something medium like which library should have its hours extended or cut  or maybe something bigger  like whether a dilapidated waterfront should be turned into a highway or a greenway  or whether all the businesses in your town should be required to pay a living wage. Think about the change that you want in your city  and then think about how you would get it  how you would make it happen. Take an inventory of all the forms of power that are at play in your city's situation  money  of course  people  yes  ideas  information  misinformation  the threat of force  the force of norms. All of these form of power are at play. Now think about how you would activate or perhaps neutralize these various forms of power. This is not some Game of Thrones empire level set of questions. These are questions that play out in every single place on the planet. I'll just tell you quickly about two stories drawn from recent headlines. In Boulder  Colorado  voters not too long ago approved a process to replace the private power company  literally the power company  the electric company Xcel  with a publicly owned utility that would forego profits and attend far more to climate change. Well  Xcel fought back  and Xcel has now put in play a ballot measure that would undermine or undo this municipalization. And so the citizen activists in Boulder who have been pushing this now literally have to fight the power in order to fight for power. In Tuscaloosa  at the University of Alabama  there's an organization on campus called  kind of menacingly  the Machine  and it draws from largely white sororities and fraternities on campus  and for decades  the Machine has dominated student government elections. Well now  recently  the Machine has started to get involved in actual city politics  and they've engineered the election of a former Machine member  a young  pro business recent graduate to the Tuscaloosa city school board. Now  as I say  these are just two examples drawn almost at random from the headlines. Every day  there are thousands more like them. And you may like or dislike the efforts I'm describing here in Boulder or in Tuscaloosa  but you cannot help but admire the power literacy of the players involved  their skill. You cannot help but reckon with and recognize the command they have of the elemental questions of civic power   what objective  what strategy  what tactics  what is the terrain  who are your enemies  who are your allies  Now I want you to return to thinking about that problem or that opportunity or that challenge in your city  and the thing it was that you want to fix or create in your city  and ask yourself  do you have command of these elemental questions of power  Could you put into practice effectively what it is that you know  This is the challenge and the opportunity for us. We live in a time right now where in spite of globalization or perhaps because of globalization  all citizenship is ever more resonantly  powerfully local. Indeed  power in our time is flowing ever faster to the city. Here in the United States  the national government has tied itself up in partisan knots. Civic imagination and innovation and creativity are emerging from local ecosystems now and radiating outward  and this great innovation  this great wave of localism that's now arriving  and you see it in how people eat and work and share and buy and move and live their everyday lives  this isn't some precious parochialism  this isn't some retreat into insularity  no. This is emergent. The localism of our time is networked powerfully. And so  for instance  consider the ways that strategies for making cities more bike friendly have spread so rapidly from Copenhagen to New York to Austin to Boston to Seattle. Think about how experiments in participatory budgeting  where everyday citizens get a chance to allocate and decide upon the allocation of city funds. Those experiments have spread from Porto Alegre  Brazil to here in New York City   to the wards of Chicago. Migrant workers from Rome to Los Angeles and many cities between are now organizing to stage strikes to remind the people who live in their cities what a day without immigrants would look like. In China  all across that country  members of the New Citizens' Movement are beginning to activate and organize to fight official corruption and graft  and they're drawing the ire of officials there  but they're also drawing the attention of anti corruption activists all around the world. In Seattle  where I'm from  we've become part of a great global array of cities that are now working together bypassing government altogether  national government altogether  in order to try to meet the carbon reduction goals of the Kyoto Protocol. All of these citizens  united  are forming a web  a great archipelago of power that allows us to bypass brokenness and monopolies of control. And our task now is to accelerate this work. Our task now is to bring more and more people into the fold of this work. That's why my organization  Citizen University  has undertaken a project now to create an everyman's curriculum in civic power. And this curriculum starts with this triad that I described earlier of values  systems and skills. And what I'd like to do is to invite all of you to help create this curriculum with the stories and the experiences and the challenges that each of you lives and faces  to create something powerfully collective. And I want to invite you in particular to try a simple exercise drawn from the early frameworks of this curriculum. I want you to write a narrative  a narrative from the future of your city  and you can date it  set it out one year from now  five years from now  a decade from now  a generation from now  and write it as a case study looking back  looking back at the change that you wanted in your city  looking back at the cause that you were championing  and describing the ways that that change and that cause came  in fact  to succeed. Describe the values of your fellow citizens that you activated  and the sense of moral purpose that you were able to stir. Recount all the different ways that you engaged the systems of government  of the marketplace  of social institutions  of faith organizations  of the media. Catalog all the skills you had to deploy  how to negotiate  how to advocate  how to frame issues  how to navigate diversity in conflict  all those skills that enabled you to bring folks on board and to overcome resistance. What you'll be doing when you write that narrative is you'll be discovering how to read power  and in the process  how to write power. So share what you write  do you what you write  and then share what you do. I invite you to literally share the narratives that you create on our Facebook page for Citizen University. But even beyond that  it's in the conversations that we have today all around the world in the simultaneous gatherings that are happening on this topic at this moment  and to think about how we can become one another's teachers and students in power. If we do that  then together we can make civics sexy again. Together  we can democratize democracy and make it safe again for amateurs. Together  we can create a great network of city that will be the most powerful collective laboratory for self government this planet has ever seen. We have the power to do that. Thank you very much. Dr. Martin Luther King  Jr.  in a      speech where he reflects upon the Civil Rights Movement  states   In the end  we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends.  As a teacher  I've internalized this message. Every day  all around us  we see the consequences of silence manifest themselves in the form of discrimination  violence  genocide and war. In the classroom  I challenge my students to explore the silences in their own lives through poetry. We work together to fill those spaces  to recognize them  to name them  to understand that they don't have to be sources of shame. In an effort to create a culture within my classroom where students feel safe sharing the intimacies of their own silences  I have four core principles posted on the board that sits in the front of my class  which every student signs at the beginning of the year  read critically  write consciously  speak clearly  tell your truth. And I find myself thinking a lot about that last point  tell your truth. And I realized that if I was going to ask my students to speak up  I was going to have to tell my truth and be honest with them about the times where I failed to do so. So I tell them that growing up  as a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans  during Lent I was always taught that the most meaningful thing one could do was to give something up  sacrifice something you typically indulge in to prove to God you understand his sanctity. I've given up soda  McDonald's  French fries  French kisses  and everything in between. But one year  I gave up speaking. I figured the most valuable thing I could sacrifice was my own voice  but it was like I hadn't realized that I had given that up a long time ago. I spent so much of my life telling people the things they wanted to hear instead of the things they needed to  told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience because I still had to figure out being my own  so sometimes I just wouldn't say anything  appeasing ignorance with my silence  unaware that validation doesn't need words to endorse its existence. When Christian was beat up for being gay  I put my hands in my pocket and walked with my head down as if I didn't even notice. I couldn't use my locker for weeks because the bolt on the lock reminded me of the one I had put on my lips when the homeless man on the corner looked at me with eyes up merely searching for an affirmation that he was worth seeing. I was more concerned with touching the screen on my Apple than actually feeding him one. When the woman at the fundraising gala said  I'm so proud of you. It must be so hard teaching those poor  unintelligent kids   I bit my lip  because apparently we needed her money more than my students needed their dignity. We spend so much time listening to the things people are saying that we rarely pay attention to the things they don't. Silence is the residue of fear. It is feeling your flaws gut wrench guillotine your tongue. It is the air retreating from your chest because it doesn't feel safe in your lungs. Silence is Rwandan genocide. Silence is Katrina. It is what you hear when there aren't enough body bags left. It is the sound after the noose is already tied. It is charring. It is chains. It is privilege. It is pain. There is no time to pick your battles when your battles have already picked you. I will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision. I will tell Christian that he is a lion  a sanctuary of bravery and brilliance. I will ask that homeless man what his name is and how his day was  because sometimes all people want to be is human. I will tell that woman that my students can talk about transcendentalism like their last name was Thoreau  and just because you watched one episode of  The Wire  doesn't mean you know anything about my kids. So this year  instead of giving something up  I will live every day as if there were a microphone tucked under my tongue  a stage on the underside of my inhibition. Because who has to have a soapbox when all you've ever needed is your voice  Thank you. TED is   . The world wide web is celebrating this month its   th anniversary. So I've got a question for you. Let's talk about the journey  mainly about the future. Let's talk about the state. Let's talk about what sort of a web we want. So    years ago  then  I was working at CERN. I got permission in the end after about a year to basically do it as a side project. I wrote the code. I was I suppose the first user. There was a lot of concern that people didn't want to pick it up because it would be too complicated. A lot of persuasion  a lot of wonderful collaboration with other people  and bit by bit  it worked. It took off. It was pretty cool. And in fact  a few years later in       five percent of the world population were using the world wide web. In       seven years later     percent. In       we formed the World Wide Web Foundation partly to look at that and worry about that figure. And now here we are in       and    percent of the world are using the world wide web  and counting. Obviously it's increasing. I want you to think about both sides of that. Okay  obviously to anybody here at TED  the first question you ask is  what can we do to get the other    percent on board as quickly as possible  Lots of important things. Obviously it's going to be around mobile. But also  I want you to think about the    percent  because if you're sitting there yourself sort of with a web enabled life  you don't remember things anymore  you just look them up  then you may feel that it's been a success and we can all sit back. But in fact  yeah  it's been a success  there's lots of things  Khan Academy for crying out loud  there's Wikipedia  there's a huge number of free e books that you can read online  lots of wonderful things for education  things in many areas. Online commerce has in some cases completely turned upside down the way commerce works altogether  made types of commerce available which weren't available at all before. Commerce has been almost universally affected. Government  not universally affected  but very affected  and on a good day  lots of open data  lots of e government  so lots of things which are visible happening on the web. Also  lots of things which are less visible. The healthcare  late at night when they're worried about what sort of cancer somebody they care about might have  when they just talk across the Internet to somebody who they care about very much in another country. Those sorts of things are not  they're not out there  and in fact they've acquired a certain amount of privacy. So we cannot assume that part of the web  part of the deal with the web  is when I use the web  it's just a transparent  neutral medium. I can talk to you over it without worrying about what we in fact now know is happening  without worrying about the fact that not only will surveillance be happening but it'll be done by people who may abuse the data. So in fact  something we realized  we can't just use the web  we have to worry about what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing  is it in fact of a quality that we need  We revel in the fact that we have this wonderful free speech. We can tweet  and oh  lots and lots of people can see our tweets  except when they can't  except when actually Twitter is blocked from their country  or in some way the way we try to express ourselves has put some information about the state of ourselves  the state of the country we live in  which isn't available to anybody else. So we must protest and make sure that censorship is cut down  that the web is opened up where there is censorship. We love the fact that the web is open. It allows us to talk. Anybody can talk to anybody. It doesn't matter who we are. And then we join these big social networking companies which are in fact effectively built as silos  so that it's much easier to talk to somebody in the same social network than it is to talk to somebody in a different one  so in fact we're sometimes limiting ourselves. And we also have  if you've read the book about the filter bubble  the filter bubble phenomenon is that we love to use machines which help us find stuff we like. So we love it when we're bathed in what things we like to click on  and so the machine automatically feeds us the stuff that we like and we end up with this rose colored spectacles view of the world called a filter bubble. So here are some of the things which maybe threaten the social web we have. What sort of web do you want  I want one which is not fragmented into lots of pieces  as some countries have been suggesting they should do in reaction to recent surveillance. I want a web which has got  for example  is a really good basis for democracy. I want a web where I can use healthcare with privacy and where there's a lot of health data  clinical data is available to scientists to do research. I want a web where the other    percent get on board as fast as possible. I want a web which is such a powerful basis for innovation that when something nasty happens  some disaster strikes  that we can respond by building stuff to respond to it very quickly. So this is just some of the things that I want  from a big list  obviously it's longer. You have your list. I want us to use this   th anniversary to think about what sort of a web we want. You can go to webat  .org and find some links. There are lots of sites where people have started to put together a Magna Carta  a bill of rights for the web. How about we do that  How about we decide  these are  in a way  becoming fundamental rights  the right to communicate with whom I want. What would be on your list for that Magna Carta  Let's crowdsource a Magna Carta for the web. Let's do that this year. Let's use the energy from the   th anniversary to crowdsource a Magna Carta to the web.  Applause  Thank you. And do me a favor  will you  Fight for it for me. Okay  Thanks. I would like to share with you today a project that has changed how I approach and practice architecture  the Fez River Rehabilitation Project. My hometown of Fez  Morocco  boasts one of the largest walled medieval cities in the world  called the medina  nestled in a river valley. The entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since the     s  as the population of the medina grew  basic urban infrastructure such as green open spaces and sewage quickly changed and got highly stressed. One of the biggest casualties of the situation was the Fez River  which bisects the medina in its middle and has been considered for many centuries as the city's very soul. In fact  one can witness the presence of the river's extensive water network all throughout the city  in places such as private and public fountains. Unfortunately  because of the pollution of the river  it has been covered little by little by concrete slabs since     . This process of erasure was coupled with the destruction of many houses along the river banks to be able to make machineries enter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina. Those urban voids quickly became illegal parking or trash yards. Actually  the state of the river before entering the medina is pretty healthy. Then pollution takes its toll  mainly due to untreated sewage and chemical dumping from crafts such as tanning. At some point  I couldn't bear the desecration of the river  such an important part of my city  and I decided to take action  especially after I heard that the city received a grant to divert sewage water and to treat it. With clean water  suddenly the uncovering of the river became possible  and with luck and actually a lot of pushing  my partner Takako Tajima and I were commissioned by the city to work with a team of engineers to uncover the river. However  we were sneaky  and we proposed more  to convert riverbanks into pedestrian pathways  and then to connect these pathways back to the city fabric  and finally to convert the urban voids along the riverbanks into public spaces that are lacking in the Medina of Fez. I will show you briefly now two of these public spaces. The first one is the Rcif Plaza  which sits actually right on top of the river  which you can see here in dotted lines. This plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub that actually compromised the urban integrity of the medina  that has the largest pedestrian network in the world. And right beyond the historic bridge that you can see here  right next to the plaza  you can see that the river looked like a river of trash. Instead  what we proposed is to make the plaza entirely pedestrian  to cover it with recycled leather canopies  and to connect it to the banks of the river. The second site of intervention is also an urban void along the river banks  and it used to be an illegal parking  and we proposed to transform it into the first playground in the medina. The playground is constructed using recycled tires and also is coupled with a constructed wetland that not only cleans the water of the river but also retains it when floods occur. As the project progressed and received several design awards  new stakeholders intervened and changed the project goals and design. The only way for us to be able to bring the main goals of the project ahead was for us to do something very unusual that usually architects don't do. It was for us to take our design ego and our sense of authorship and put it in the backseat and to focus mainly on being activists and on trying to coalesce all of the agendas of stakeholders and focus on the main goals of the project  that is  to uncover the river  treat its water  and provide public spaces for all. We were actually very lucky  and many of those goals happened or are in the process of happening. Like  you can see here in the Rcif Plaza. This is how it looked like about six years ago. This is how it looks like today. It's still under construction  but actually it is heavily used by the local population. And finally  this is how the Rcif Plaza will look like when the project is completed. This is the river  covered  used as a trash yard. Then after many years of work  the river with clean water  uncovered. And finally  you can see here the river when the project will be completed. So for sure  the Fez River Rehabilitation will keep on changing and adapting to the sociopolitical landscape of the city  but we strongly believe that by reimagining the role and the agency of the architect  we have set up the core idea of the project into motion  that is  to transform the river from sewage to public space for all  thereby making sure that the city of Fez will remain a living city for its inhabitants rather than a mummified heritage. Thank you very much. When my first children's book was published in       I returned to my old elementary school to talk to the students about being an author and an illustrator  and when I was setting up my slide projector in the cafetorium  I looked across the room  and there she was  my old lunch lady. She was still there at the school and she was busily preparing lunches for the day. So I approached her to say hello  and I said   Hi  Jeannie  How are you   And she looked at me  and I could tell that she recognized me  but she couldn't quite place me  and she looked at me and she said   Stephen Krosoczka   And I was amazed that she knew I was a Krosoczka  but Stephen is my uncle who is    years older than I am  and she had been his lunch lady when he was a kid. And she started telling me about her grandkids  and that blew my mind. My lunch lady had grandkids  and therefore kids  and therefore left school at the end of the day  I thought she lived in the cafeteria with the serving spoons. I had never thought about any of that before. Well  that chance encounter inspired my imagination  and I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series  a series of comics about a lunch lady who uses her fish stick nunchucks to fight off evil cyborg substitutes  a school bus monster  and mutant mathletes  and the end of every book  they get the bad guy with their hairnet  and they proclaim   Justice is served   And it's been amazing  because the series was so welcomed into the reading lives of children  and they sent me the most amazing letters and cards and artwork. And I would notice as I would visit schools  the lunch staff would be involved in the programming in a very meaningful way. And coast to coast  all of the lunch ladies told me the same thing   Thank you for making a superhero in our likeness.  Because the lunch lady has not been treated very kindly in popular culture over time. But it meant the most to Jeannie. When the books were first published  I invited her to the book launch party  and in front of everyone there  everyone she had fed over the years  I gave her a piece of artwork and some books. And two years after this photo was taken  she passed away  and I attended her wake  and nothing could have prepared me for what I saw there  because next to her casket was this painting  and her husband told me it meant so much to her that I had acknowledged her hard work  I had validated what she did. And that inspired me to create a day where we could recreate that feeling in cafeterias across the country  School Lunch Hero Day  a day where kids can make creative projects for their lunch staff. And I partnered with the School Nutrition Association  and did you know that a little over    million kids participate in school lunch programs every day. That equals up to a little over five billion lunches made every school year. And the stories of heroism go well beyond just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets on their lunch tray. There is Ms. Brenda in California  who keeps a close eye on every student that comes through her line and then reports back to the guidance counselor if anything is amiss. There are the lunch ladies in Kentucky who realized that    percent of their students relied on those meals every day  and they were going without food over the summer  so they retrofitted a school bus to create a mobile feeding unit  and they traveled around the neighborhoods feedings     kids a day during the summer. And kids made the most amazing projects. I knew they would. Kids made hamburger cards that were made out of construction paper. They took photos of their lunch lady's head and plastered it onto my cartoon lunch lady and fixed that to a milk carton and presented them with flowers. And they made their own comics  starring the cartoon lunch lady alongside their actual lunch ladies. And they made thank you pizzas  where every kid signed a different topping of a construction paper pizza. For me  I was so moved by the response that came from the lunch ladies  because one woman said to me  she said   Before this day  I felt like I was at the end of the planet at this school. I didn't think that anyone noticed us down here.  Another woman said to me   You know  what I got out of this is that what I do is important.  And of course what she does is important. What they all do is important. They're feeding our children every single day  and before a child can learn  their belly needs to be full  and these women and men are working on the front lines to create an educated society. So I hope that you don't wait for School Lunch Hero Day to say thank you to your lunch staff  and I hope that you remember how powerful a thank you can be. A thank you can change a life. It changes the life of the person who receives it  and it changes the life of the person who expresses it. Thank you. Oliver was an extremely dashing  handsome  charming and largely unstable male that I completely lost my heart to. He was a Bernese mountain dog  and my ex husband and I adopted him  and about six months in  we realized that he was a mess. He had such paralyzing separation anxiety that we couldn't leave him alone. Once  he jumped out of our third floor apartment. He ate fabric. He ate things  recyclables. He hunted flies that didn't exist. He suffered from hallucinations. He was diagnosed with a canine compulsive disorder and that's really just the tip of the iceberg. But like with humans  sometimes it's six months in before you realize that the person that you love has some issues. And most of us do not take the person we're dating back to the bar where we met them or give them back to the friend that introduced us  or sign them back up on Match.com. We love them anyway  and we stick to it  and that is what I did with my dog. And I was a   I'd studied biology. I have a Ph.D. in history of science from MIT  and had you asked me    years ago if a dog I loved  or just dogs generally  had emotions  I would have said yes  but I'm not sure that I would have told you that they can also wind up with an anxiety disorder  a Prozac prescription and a therapist. But then  I fell in love  and I realized that they can  and actually trying to help my own dog overcome his panic and his anxiety  it just changed my life. It cracked open my world. And I spent the last seven years  actually  looking into this topic of mental illness in other animals. Can they be mentally ill like people  and if so  what does it mean about us  And what I discovered is that I do believe they can suffer from mental illness  and actually looking and trying to identify mental illness in them often helps us be better friends to them and also can help us better understand ourselves. So let's talk about diagnosis for a minute. Many of us think that we can't know what another animal is thinking  and that is true  but any of you in relationships   at least this is my case   just because you ask someone that you're with or your parent or your child how they feel doesn't mean that they can tell you. They may not have words to explain what it is that they're feeling  and they may not know. It's actually a pretty recent phenomenon that we feel that we have to talk to someone to understand their emotional distress. Before the early   th century  physicians often diagnosed emotional distress in their patients just by observation. It also turns out that thinking about mental illness in other animals isn't actually that much of a stretch. Most mental disorders in the United States are fear and anxiety disorders  and when you think about it  fear and anxiety are actually really extremely helpful animal emotions. Usually we feel fear and anxiety in situations that are dangerous  and once we feel them  we then are motivated to move away from whatever is dangerous. The problem is when we begin to feel fear and anxiety in situations that don't call for it. Mood disorders  too  may actually just be the unfortunate downside of being a feeling animal  and obsessive compulsive disorders also are often manifestations of a really healthy animal thing which is keeping yourself clean and groomed. This tips into the territory of mental illness when you do things like compulsively over wash your hands or paws  or you develop a ritual that's so extreme that you can't sit down to a bowl of food unless you engage in that ritual. So for humans  we have the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual   which is basically an atlas of the currently agreed upon mental disorders. In other animals  we have YouTube. This is just one search I did for  OCD dog  but I encourage all of you to look at  OCD cat.  You will be shocked by what you see. I'm going to show you just a couple examples. This is an example of shadow chasing. I know  and it's funny and in some ways it's cute. The issue  though  is that dogs can develop compulsions like this that they then engage in all day. So they won't go for a walk  they won't hang out with their friends  they won't eat. They'll develop fixations like chasing their tails compulsively. Here's an example of a cat named Gizmo. He looks like he's on a stakeout but he does this for many  many  many hours a day. He just sits there and he will paw and paw and paw at the screen. This is another example of what's considered a stereotypic behavior. This is a sun bear at the Oakland Zoo named Ting Ting. And if you just sort of happened upon this scene  you might think that Ting Ting is just playing with a stick  but Ting Ting does this all day  and if you pay close attention and if I showed you guys the full half hour of this clip  you'd see that he does the exact same thing in the exact same order  and he spins the stick in the exact same way every time. Other super common behaviors that you may see  particularly in captive animals  are pacing stereotypies or swaying stereotypies  and actually  humans do this too  and in us  we'll sway  we'll move from side to side. Many of us do this  and sometimes it's an effort to soothe ourselves  and I think in other animals that is often the case too. But it's not just stereotypic behaviors that other animals engage in. This is Gigi. She's a gorilla that lives at the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston. She actually has a Harvard psychiatrist  and she's been treated for a mood disorder among other things. Many animals develop mood disorders. Lots of creatures   this horse is just one example   develop self destructive behaviors. They'll gnaw on things or do other things that may also soothe them  even if they're self destructive  which could be considered similar to the ways that some humans cut themselves. Plucking. Turns out  if you have fur or feathers or skin  you can pluck yourself compulsively  and some parrots actually have been studied to better understand trichotillomania  or compulsive plucking in humans  something that affects    million Americans right now. Lab rats pluck themselves too. In them  it's called barbering. Canine veterans of conflicts of Iraq and Afghanistan are coming back with what's considered canine PTSD  and they're having a hard time reentering civilian life when they come back from deployments. They can be too scared to approach men with beards or to hop into cars. I want to be careful and be clear  though. I do not think that canine PTSD is the same as human PTSD. But I also do not think that my PTSD is like your PTSD  or that my anxiety or that my sadness is like yours. We are all different. We also all have very different susceptibilities. So two dogs  raised in the same household  exposed to the very same things  one may develop  say  a debilitating fear of motorcycles  or a phobia of the beep of the microwave  and another one is going to be just fine. So one thing that people ask me pretty frequently  Is this just an instance of humans driving other animals crazy  Or  is animal mental illness just a result of mistreatment or abuse  And it turns out we're actually so much more complicated than that. So one great thing that has happened to me is recently I published a book on this  and every day now that I open my email or when I go to a reading or even when I go to a cocktail party  people tell me their stories of the animals that they have met. And recently  I did a reading in California  and a woman raised her hand after the talk and she said   Dr. Braitman  I think my cat has PTSD.  And I said   Well  why  Tell me a little bit about it.  So  Ping is her cat. She was a rescue  and she used to live with an elderly man  and one day the man was vacuuming and he suffered a heart attack  and he died. A week later  Ping was discovered in the apartment alongside the body of her owner  and the vacuum had been running the entire time. For many months  up to I think two years after that incident  she was so scared she couldn't be in the house when anyone was cleaning. She was quite literally a scaredy cat. She would hide in the closet. She was un self confident and shaky  but with the loving support of her family  a lot of a time  and their patience  now  three years later  she's actually a happy  confident cat. Another story of trauma and recovery that I came across was actually a few years ago. I was in Thailand to do some research. I met a monkey named Boonlua  and when Boonlua was a baby  he was attacked by a pack of dogs  and they ripped off both of his legs and one arm  and Boonlua dragged himself to a monastery  where the monks took him in. They called in a veterinarian  who treated his wounds. Eventually  Boonlua wound up at an elephant facility  and the keepers really decided to take him under their wing  and they figured out what he liked  which  it turned out  was mint Mentos and Rhinoceros beetles and eggs. But they worried  because he was social  that he was lonely  and they didn't want to put him in with another monkey  because they thought with just one arm  he wouldn't be able to defend himself or even play. And so they gave him a rabbit  and Boonlua was immediately a different monkey. He was extremely happy to be with this rabbit. They groomed each other  they become close friends  and then the rabbit had bunnies  and Boonlua was even happier than he was before  and it had in a way given him a reason to wake up in the morning  and in fact it gave him such a reason to wake up that he decided not to sleep. He became extremely protective of these bunnies  and he stopped sleeping  and he would sort of nod off while trying to take care of them. In fact  he was so protective and so affectionate with these babies that the sanctuary eventually had to take them away from him because he was so protective  he was worried that their mother might hurt them. So after they were taken away  the sanctuary staff worried that he would fall into a depression  and so to avoid that  they gave him another rabbit friend. My official opinion is that he does not look depressed. So one thing that I would really like people to feel is that you really should feel empowered to make some assumptions about the creatures that you know well. So when it comes to your dog or your cat or maybe your one armed monkey that you happen to know  if you think that they are traumatized or depressed  you're probably right. This is extremely anthropomorphic  or the assignation of human characteristics onto non human animals or things. I don't think  though  that that's a problem. I don't think that we can not anthropomorphize. It's not as if you can take your human brain out of your head and put it in a jar and then use it to think about another animal thinking. We will always be one animal wondering about the emotional experience of another animal. So then the choice becomes  how do you anthropomorphize well  Or do you anthropomorphize poorly  And anthropomorphizing poorly is all too common. It may include dressing your corgis up and throwing them a wedding  or getting too close to exotic wildlife because you believe that you had a spiritual connection. There's all manner of things. Anthropomorphizing well  however  I believe is based on accepting our animal similarities with other species and using them to make assumptions that are informed about other  animals' minds and experiences  and there's actually an entire industry that is in some ways based on anthropomorphizing well  and that is the psychopharmaceutical industry. One in five Americans is currently taking a psychopharmaceutical drug  from the antidepressants and antianxiety medications to the antipsychotics. It turns out that we owe this entire psychopharmaceutical arsenal to other animals. These drugs were tested in non human animals first  and not just for toxicity but for behavioral effects. The very popular antipsychotic Thorazine first relaxed rats before it relaxed people. The antianxiety medication Librium was given to cats selected for their meanness in the     s and made them into peaceable felines. And even antidepressants were first tested in rabbits. Today  however  we are not just giving these drugs to other animals as test subjects  but they're giving them these drugs as patients  both in ethical and much less ethical ways. SeaWorld gives mother orcas antianxiety medications when their calves are taken away. Many zoo gorillas have been given antipsychotics and antianxiety medications. But dogs like my own Oliver are given antidepressants and some antianxiety medications to keep them from jumping out of buildings or jumping into traffic. Just recently  actually  a study came out in  Science  that showed that even crawdads responded to antianxiety medication. It made them braver  less skittish  and more likely to explore their environment. It's hard to know how many animals are on these drugs  but I can tell you that the animal pharmaceutical industry is immense and growing  from seven billion dollars in      to a projected  .   billion by the year     . Some animals are on these drugs indefinitely. Others  like one bonobo who lives in Milwaukee at the zoo there was on them until he started to save his Paxil prescription and then distribute it among the other bonobos. More than psychopharmaceuticals  though  there are many  many  many other therapeutic interventions that help other creatures. And here is a place where I think actually that veterinary medicine can teach something to human medicine  which is  if you take your dog  who is  say  compulsively chasing his tail  into the veterinary behaviorist  their first action isn't to reach for the prescription pad  it's to ask you about your dog's life. They want to know how often your dog gets outside. They want to know how much exercise your dog is getting. They want to know how much social time with other dogs and other humans. They want to talk to you about what sorts of therapies  largely behavior therapies  you've tried with that animal. Those are the things that often tend to help the most  especially when combined with psychopharmaceuticals. The thing  though  I believe  that helps the most  particularly with social animals  is time with other social animals. In many ways  I feel like I became a service animal to my own dog  and I have seen parrots do it for people and people do it for parrots and dogs do it for elephants and elephants do it for other elephants. I don't know about you  I get a lot of Internet forwards of unlikely animal friendships. I also think it's a huge part of Facebook  the monkey that adopts the cat or the great dane who adopted the orphaned fawn  or the cow that makes friends with the pig  and had you asked me eight  nine years ago  about these  I would have told you that they were hopelessly sentimental and maybe too anthropomorphic in the wrong way and maybe even staged  and what I can tell you now is that there is actually something to this. This is legit. In fact  some interesting studies have pointed to oxytocin levels  which are a kind of bonding hormone that we release when we're having sex or nursing or around someone that we care for extremely  oxytocin levels raising in both humans and dogs who care about each other or who enjoy each other's company  and beyond that  other studies show that oxytocin raised even in other pairs of animals  so  say  in goats and dogs who were friends and played with each other  their levels spiked afterwards. I have a friend who really showed me that mental health is in fact a two way street. His name is Lonnie Hodge  and he's a veteran of Vietnam. When he returned  he started working with survivors of genocide and a lot of people who had gone through war trauma. And he had PTSD and also a fear of heights  because in Vietnam  he had been rappelling backwards out of helicopters over the skids  and he was givena service dog named Gander  a labradoodle  to help him with PTSD and his fear of heights. This is them actually on the first day that they met  which is amazing  and since then  they've spent a lot of time together visiting with other veterans suffering from similar issues. But what's so interesting to me about Lonnie and Gander's relationship is about a few months in  Gander actually developed a fear of heights  probably because he was watching Lonnie so closely. What's pretty great about this  though  is that he's still a fantastic service dog  because now  when they're both at a great height  Lonnie is so concerned with Gander's well being that he forgets to be scared of the heights himself. Since I've spent so much time with these stories  digging into archives  I literally spent years doing this research  and it's changed me. I no longer look at animals at the species level. I look at them as individuals  and I think about them as creatures with their own individual weather systems guiding their behavior and informing how they respond to the world. And I really believe that this has made me a more curious and a more empathetic person  both to the animals that share my bed and occasionally wind up on my plate  but also to the people that I know who are suffering from anxiety and from phobias and all manner of other things  and I really do believe that even though you can't know exactly what's going on in the mind of a pig or your pug or your partner  that that shouldn't stop you from empathizing with them. The best thing that we could do for our loved ones is  perhaps  to anthropomorphize them. Charles Darwin's father once told him that everybody could lose their mind at some point. Thankfully  we can often find them again  but only with each other's help. Thank you. These are simple objects  clocks  keys  combs  glasses. They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey. We are all familiar with these mundane  everyday objects. The fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them. Usually  they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war. These items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland  and as we speak  forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves     years after the war. And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered. During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '  s  approximately        citizens  mainly civilians  went missing  presumed killed  and another         were killed during combat operations. Most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities  when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serb army. The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide. Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial  political  religious or ethnic group. As much as genocide is about killing. It is also about destroying their property  their cultural heritage  and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed. Genocide is not only about the killing  it is about the denied identity. There are always traces   no such thing as a perfect crime. There are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them. These items are recovered from numerous mass graves  and the main goal of this collection of the items is a unique process of identifying those who disappeared in the killings  the first act of genocide on European soil since the Holocaust. Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified. Once recovered  these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned  analyzed  catalogued and stored. Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI. These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims  but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials. Survivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically  but physical browsing is extremely difficult  an ineffective and painful process. Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects  they become orphans of the narrative. Many of them get destroyed  believe it or not  or they get simply shelved  out of sight and out of mind. I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse. As a storyteller  I like to give back to the community. I like to move beyond raising awareness. And in this case  someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent  unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened. Photography is about empathy  and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy. In this case  I am merely a tool  a forensic  if you like  and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document. Once all the missing persons are identified  only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain. In all their simplicity  these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims  the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed. Thank you very much. Ten years ago  I wrote a book which I entitled  Our Final Century   Question mark. My publishers cut out the question mark.  Laughter  The American publishers changed our title to  Our Final Hour.  Americans like instant gratification and the reverse. And my theme was this  Our Earth has existed for    million centuries  but this one is special   it's the first where one species  ours  has the planet's future in its hands. Over nearly all of Earth's history  threats have come from nature   disease  earthquakes  asteroids and so forth   but from now on  the worst dangers come from us. And it's now not just the nuclear threat  in our interconnected world  network breakdowns can cascade globally  air travel can spread pandemics worldwide within days  and social media can spread panic and rumor literally at the speed of light. We fret too much about minor hazards   improbable air crashes  carcinogens in food  low radiation doses  and so forth   but we and our political masters are in denial about catastrophic scenarios. The worst have thankfully not yet happened. Indeed  they probably won't. But if an event is potentially devastating  it's worth paying a substantial premium to safeguard against it  even if it's unlikely  just as we take out fire insurance on our house. And as science offers greater power and promise  the downside gets scarier too. We get ever more vulnerable. Within a few decades  millions will have the capability to misuse rapidly advancing biotech  just as they misuse cybertech today. Freeman Dyson  in a TED Talk  foresaw that children will design and create new organisms just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets. Well  this may be on the science fiction fringe  but were even part of his scenario to come about  our ecology and even our species would surely not survive long unscathed. For instance  there are some eco extremists who think that it would be better for the planet  for Gaia  if there were far fewer humans. What happens when such people have mastered synthetic biology techniques that will be widespread by       And by then  other science fiction nightmares may transition to reality  dumb robots going rogue  or a network that develops a mind of its own threatens us all. Well  can we guard against such risks by regulation  We must surely try  but these enterprises are so competitive  so globalized  and so driven by commercial pressure  that anything that can be done will be done somewhere  whatever the regulations say. It's like the drug laws   we try to regulate  but can't. And the global village will have its village idiots  and they'll have a global range. So as I said in my book  we'll have a bumpy ride through this century. There may be setbacks to our society   indeed  a    percent chance of a severe setback. But are there conceivable events that could be even worse  events that could snuff out all life  When a new particle accelerator came online  some people anxiously asked  could it destroy the Earth or  even worse  rip apart the fabric of space  Well luckily  reassurance could be offered. I and others pointed out that nature has done the same experiments zillions of times already  via cosmic ray collisions. But scientists should surely be precautionary about experiments that generate conditions without precedent in the natural world. Biologists should avoid release of potentially devastating genetically modified pathogens. And by the way  our special aversion to the risk of truly existential disasters depends on a philosophical and ethical question  and it's this  Consider two scenarios. Scenario A wipes out    percent of humanity. Scenario B wipes out     percent. How much worse is B than A  Some would say    percent worse. The body count is    percent higher. But I claim that B is incomparably worse. As an astronomer  I can't believe that humans are the end of the story. It is five billion years before the sun flares up  and the universe may go on forever  so post human evolution  here on Earth and far beyond  could be as prolonged as the Darwinian process that's led to us  and even more wonderful. And indeed  future evolution will happen much faster  on a technological timescale  not a natural selection timescale. So we surely  in view of those immense stakes  shouldn't accept even a one in a billion risk that human extinction would foreclose this immense potential. Some scenarios that have been envisaged may indeed be science fiction  but others may be disquietingly real. It's an important maxim that the unfamiliar is not the same as the improbable  and in fact  that's why we at Cambridge University are setting up a center to study how to mitigate these existential risks. It seems it's worthwhile just for a few people to think about these potential disasters. And we need all the help we can get from others  because we are stewards of a precious pale blue dot in a vast cosmos  a planet with    million centuries ahead of it. And so let's not jeopardize that future. And I'd like to finish with a quote from a great scientist called Peter Medawar. I quote   The bells that toll for mankind are like the bells of Alpine cattle. They are attached to our own necks  and it must be our fault if they do not make a tuneful and melodious sound.  Thank you very much. In Kenya       is known as the year of the cup  or the goro goro. The goro goro is a cup used to measure two kilograms of maize flower on the market  and the maize flower is used to make ugali  a polenta like cake that is eaten together with vegetables. Both the maize and the vegetables are grown on most Kenyan farms  which means that most families can feed themselves from their own farm. One goro goro can feed three meals for an average family  and in       the whole harvest could fit in one goro goro. It was and still is one of the worst droughts in living memory. Now today  I insure farmers against droughts like those in the year of the cup  or to be more specific  I insure the rains. I come from a family of missionaries who built hospitals in Indonesia  and my father built a psychiatric hospital in Tanzania. This is me  age five  in front of that hospital. I don't think they thought I'd grow up to sell insurance.  Laughter  So let me tell you how that happened. In       I was working for the Ministry of Agriculture of Rwanda  and my boss had just been promoted to become the minister. She launched an ambitious plan to start a green revolution in her country  and before we knew it  we were importing tons of fertilizer and seed and telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer and plant. A couple of weeks later  the International Monetary Fund visited us  and asked my minister   Minister  it's great that you want to help farmers reach food security  but what if it doesn't rain   My minister answered proudly and somewhat defiantly   I am going to pray for rain.  That ended the discussion. On the way back to the ministry in the car  she turned around to me and said   Rose  you've always been interested in finance. Go find us some insurance.  It's been six years since  and last year I was fortunate enough to be part of a team that insured over         farmers in Kenya and Rwanda against drought. They owned an average of half an acre and paid on average two Euros in premium. It's microinsurance. Now  traditional insurance doesn't work with two to three Euros of premium  because traditional insurance relies on farm visits. A farmer here in Germany would be visited for the start of the season  halfway through  and at the end  and again if there was a loss  to estimate the damages. For a small scale farmer in the middle of Africa  the maths of doing those visits simply don't add up. So instead  we rely on technology and data. This satellite measures whether there were clouds or not  because think about it  If there are clouds  then you might have some rain  but if there are no clouds  then it's actually impossible for it to rain. These images show the onset of the rains this season in Kenya. You see that around March    the clouds move in and then disappear  and then around the March     the clouds really move in. That  and those clouds  were the onset of the rains this year. This satellite covers the whole of Africa and goes back as far as       and that's important  because if you know how many times a place has had a drought in the last    years  you can make a pretty good estimate what the chances are of drought in the future  and that means that you can put a price tag on the risk of drought. The data alone isn't enough. We devise agronomic algorithms which tell us how much rainfall a crop needs and when. For example  for maize at planting  you need to have two days of rain for farmers to plant  and then it needs to rain once every two weeks for the crop to properly germinate. After that  you need rain every three weeks for the crop to form its leaves  whereas at flowering  you need it to rain more frequently  about once every    days for the crop to form its cob. At the end of the season  you actually don't want it to rain  because rains then can damage the crop. Devising such a cover is difficult  but it turned out the real challenge was selling insurance. We set ourselves a modest target of     farmers insured after our first season. After a couple of months' intense marketing  we had signed up the grand total of     farmers. I was disappointed and confounded. Everybody kept telling me that farmers wanted insurance  but our prime customers simply weren't buying. They were waiting to see what would happen  didn't trust insurance companies  or thought   I've managed for so many years. Why would I buy insurance now   Now many of you know microcredit  the method of providing small loans to poor people pioneered by Muhammad Yunus  who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the Grameen Bank. Turns out  selling microcredit isn't the same as selling insurance. For credit  a farmer needs to earn the trust of a bank  and if it succeeds  the bank will advance him money. That's an attractive proposition. For insurance  the farmer needs to trust the insurance company  and needs to advance the insurance company money. It's a very different value proposition. And so the uptick of insurance has been slow  with so far only  .  percent of Africans taking up insurance in       and half of that number is in one country  South Africa. We tried for some years selling insurance directly to farmers  with very high marketing cost and very limited success. Then we realized that there were many organizations working with farmers  seed companies  microfinance institutions  mobile phone companies  government agencies. They were all providing loans to farmers  and often  just before they'd finalize the loan  the farmer would say   But what if it doesn't rain  How do you expect me to repay my loan   Many of these organizations were taking on the risk themselves  simply hoping that that year  the worst wouldn't happen. Most of the organizations  however  were limiting their growth in agriculture. They couldn't take on this kind of risk. These organizations became our customers  and when combining credit and insurance  interesting things can happen. Let me tell you one more story. At the start of February      in western Kenya  the rains started  and they started early  and when rains start early  farmers are encouraged  because it usually means that the season is going to be good. So they took out loans and planted. For the next three weeks  there wasn't a single drop of rain  and the crops that had germinated so well shriveled and died. We'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution that had provided those loans to about       farmers in that area  and we called them up and said   Look  we know about the drought. We've got you. We'll give you         Euros at the end of the season.  They said   Wow  that's great  but that'll be late. Could you give us the money now  Then these farmers can still replant and can get a harvest this season.  So we convinced our insurance partners  and later that April  these farmers replanted. We took the idea of replanting to a seed company and convinced them to price the cost of insurance into every bag of seed  and in every bag  we packed a card that had a number on it  and when the farmers would open the card  they'd text in that number  and that number would actually help us to locate the farmer and allocate them to a satellite pixel. A satellite would then measure the rainfall for the next three weeks  and if it didn't rain  we'd replace their seed. One of the first   One of the first beneficiaries of this replanting guarantee was Bosco Mwinyi. We visited his farm later that August  and I wish I could show you the smile on his face when he showed us his harvest  because it warmed my heart and it made me realize why selling insurance can be a good thing. But you know  he insisted that we get his whole harvest in the picture  so we had to zoom out a lot. Insurance secured his harvest that season  and I believe that today  we have all the tools to enable African farmers to take control of their own destiny. No more years of the cup. Instead  I am looking forward to  at least somehow  the year of the insurance  or the year of the great harvest. Thank you. Talking about empowerment is odd  because when we talk about empowerment  what affects us most are the stories. So I want to begin with an everyday story. What is it really like to be a young woman in India  Now  I've spent the last    years of my life in India  lived in three small towns  two major cities  and I've had several experiences. When I was seven  a private tutor who used to come home to teach me mathematics molested me. He would put his hand up my skirt. He put his hand up my skirt and told me he knew how to make me feel good. At     a boy from my high school circulated an email detailing all the sexually aggressive things he could do to me because I didn't pay attention to him. At     I helped a friend whose parents had forcefully married her to an older man escape an abusive marriage. At     when my friend and I were walking down the road one afternoon  a man pulled down his pants and masturbated in front of us. We called people for help  and nobody came. At     when I was walking home one evening  two men on a motorcycle attacked me. I spent two nights in the hospital recovering from trauma and injuries. So throughout my life  I've seen women   family  friends  colleagues   live through these experiences  and they seldom talk about it. So in simple words  life in India is not easy. But today I'm not going to talk to you about this fear. I'm going to talk to you about an interesting path of learning that this fear took me on. So  what happened one night in December      changed my life. So a young girl  a    year old student  boarded a bus in Delhi with her male friend. There were six men on the bus  young men who you might encounter every day in India  and the chilling account of what followed was played over and over again in the Indian and international media. This girl was raped repeatedly  forcefully penetrated with a blunt rod  beaten  bitten  and left to die. Her friend was gagged  attacked  and knocked unconscious. She died on the   th of December. And at a time when most of us here were preparing to welcome the new year  India plunged into darkness. For the first time in our history  men and women in Indian cities woke up to the horrific truth about the true state of women in the country. Now  like many other young women  I was absolutely terrified. I couldn't believe that something like this could happen in a national capital. I was angry and I was frustrated  but most of all  I felt utterly  completely helpless. But really  what do you do  right  Some write blogs  some ignore it  some join protests. I did all of it. In fact  that was what everyone was doing two years ago. So the media was filled with stories about all the horrific deeds that Indian men are capable of. They were compared to animals  sexually repressed beasts. In fact  so alien and unthinkable was this event in an Indian mind that the response from the Indian media  public and politicians proved one point  No one knew what to do. And no one wanted to be responsible for it. In fact  these were a few insensitive comments which were made in the media by prominent people in response to sexual violence against women in general. So the first one is made by a member of parliament  the second one is made by a spiritual leader  and the third one was actually the defendants' lawyer when the girl was fighting for her life and she passed away. Now  as a woman watching this day after day  I was tired. So as a writer and gender activist  I have written extensively on women  but this time  I realized it was different  because a part of me realized I was a part of that young woman too  and I decided I wanted to change this. So I did something spontaneous  hasty. I logged on to a citizen journalism platform called iReport  and I recorded a video talking about what the scene was like in Bangalore. I talked about how I felt  I talked about the ground realities  and I talked about the frustrations of living in India. In a few hours  the blog was shared widely  and comments and thoughts poured in from across the world. In that moment  a few things occurred to me. One  technology was always at hand for many young women like me. Two  like me  most young women hardly use it to express their views. Three  I realized for the first time that my voice mattered. So in the months that followed  I covered a trail of events in Bangalore which had no space in the mainstream news. In Cubbon Park  which is a big park in Bangalore  I gathered with over     others when groups of young men came forward to wear skirts to prove that clothing does not invite rape. When I reported about these events  I felt I had charge  I felt like I had a channel to release all the emotions I had inside me. I attended the town hall march when students held up signs saying  Kill them  hang them.   You wouldn't do this to your mothers or sisters.  I went to a candlelight vigil where citizens gathered together to talk about the issue of sexual violence openly  and I recorded a lot of blogs in response to how worrying the situation was in India at that point.   I am born with sisters and cousin who now live in cities and abroad but they never talk to me or complain about their daily difficulties like you say   Now  the reactions confused me. While supportive comments poured in from across the world  as did vicious ones. So some called me a hypocrite. Some called me a victim  a rape apologist. Some even said I had a political motive. But this one comment kind of describes what we are discussing here today. But I was soon to learn that this was not all. As empowered as I felt with the new liberty that this citizen journalism channel gave me  I found myself in an unfamiliar situation. So sometime last August  I logged onto Facebook and I was looking through my news feed  and I noticed there was a link that was being shared by my friends. I clicked on the link  it led me back to a report uploaded by an American girl called Michaela Cross. The report was titled   India  The story you never wanted to hear.  And in this report  she recounted her firsthand account of facing sexual harassment in India. She wrote   There is no way to prepare for the eyes  the eyes that every day stared with such entitlement at my body  with no change of expression whether I met their gaze or not. Walking to the fruit seller's or the tailor's  I got stares so sharp that they sliced away bits of me piece by piece.  She called India a traveler's heaven and a woman's hell. She said she was stalked  groped  and masturbated at. Now  late that evening  the report went viral. It was on news channels across the world. Everyone was discussing it. It had over a million views  a thousand comments and shares  and I found myself witnessing a very similar thing. The media was caught in this vicious cycle of opinion and outburst and no outcome whatsoever. So that night  as I sat wondering how I should respond  I found myself filled with doubt. You see  as a writer  I approached this issue as an observer  as an Indian  I felt embarrassment and disbelief  and as an activist  I looked at it as a defender of rights  but as a citizen journalist  I suddenly felt very vulnerable. I mean  here she was  a young woman who was using a channel to talk about her experience just as I was  and yet I felt unsettled. You see  no one ever tells you that true empowerment comes from giving yourself the permission to think and act. Empowerment is often made to sound as if it's an ideal  it's a wonderful outcome. When we talk about empowerment  we often talk about giving people access to materials  giving them access to tools. But the thing is  empowerment is an emotion. It's a feeling. The first step to empowerment is to give yourself the authority  the key to independent will  and for women everywhere  no matter who we are or where we come from  that is the most difficult step. We fear the sound of our own voice  for it means admission  but it is this that gives us the power to change our environment. Now in this situation where I was faced with so many different kinds of realities  I was unsure how to judge  because I didn't know what it would mean for me. I feared to judge because I didn't know what it would be if I didn't support the same view as this girl. I didn't know what it would mean for me if I was challenging someone else's truth. But yet  it was simple. I had to make a decision  Should I speak up or should I stay quiet  So after a lot of thought  I recorded a video blog in response  and I told Michaela  well  there are different sides to India  and I also tried to explain that things would be okay and I expressed my regret for what she had faced. And a few days later  I was invited to talk on air with her  and for the first time  I reached out to this girl who I had never met  who was so far away  but yet I felt so close to. Since this report came to light  more young people than ever were discussing sexual harassment on the campus  and the university that Michaela belonged to gave her the assistance she needed. The university even took measures to train its students to equip them with the skills that they need to confront challenges such as harassment  and for the first the time  I felt I wasn't alone. You see  if there's anything that I've learned as an active citizen journalist over the past few years  it is our dire lack as a society to actively find avenues where our voices can be heard. We don't realize that when we are standing up  we are not just standing up as individuals  we are standing up for our communities  our friends  our peers. Most of us say that women are denied their rights  but the truth is  oftentimes  women deny themselves these rights. In a recent survey in India     percent of the women who work in I.T.  aviation  hospitality and call centers  said they didn't feel safe returning home alone after work in the late hours or in the evening. In Bangalore  where I come from  this number is    percent. In rural areas in India  if anything is to go by the recent gang rapes in Badaun and acid attacks in Odisha and Aligarh are supposed to go by  we need to act really soon. Don't get me wrong  the challenges that women will face in telling their stories is real  but we need to start pursuing and trying to identify mediums to participate in our system and not just pursue the media blindly. Today  more women than ever are standing up and questioning the government in India  and this is a result of that courage. There is a sixfold increase in women reporting harassment  and the government passed the Criminal Law  Amendment  Act in      to protect women against sexual assault. As I end this talk  I just want to say that I know a lot of us in this room have our secrets  but let us speak up. Let us fight the shame and talk about it. It could be a platform  a community  your loved one  whoever or whatever you choose  but let us speak up. The truth is  the end to this problem begins with us. Thank you. So recently  some white guys and some black women swapped Twitter avatars  or pictures online. They didn't change their content  they kept tweeting the same as usual  but suddenly  the white guys noticed they were getting called the n word all the time and they were getting the worst kind of online abuse  whereas the black women all of a sudden noticed things got a lot more pleasant for them. Now  if you're my five year old  your Internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies and occasionally fairies riding puppies. That's a thing. Google it. But the rest of us know that the Internet can be a really ugly place. I'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates that I think are healthy for our democracy. I'm talking about nasty personal attacks. Maybe it's happened to you  but it's at least twice as likely to happen  and be worse  if you're a woman  a person of color  or gay  or more than one at the same time. In fact  just as I was writing this talk  I found a Twitter account called  SallyKohnSucks. The bio says that I'm a  man hater and a bull dyke and the only thing I've ever accomplished with my career is spreading my perverse sexuality.  Which  incidentally  is only a third correct. I mean  lies   Laughter  But seriously  we all say we hate this crap. The question is whether you're willing to make a personal sacrifice to change it. I don't mean giving up the Internet. I mean changing the way you click  because clicking is a public act. It's no longer the case that a few powerful elites control all the media and the rest of us are just passive receivers. Increasingly  we're all the media. I used to think  oh  okay  I get dressed up  I put on a lot of makeup  I go on television  I talk about the news. That is a public act of making media. And then I go home and I browse the web and I'm reading Twitter  and that's a private act of consuming media. I mean  of course it is. I'm in my pajamas. Wrong. Everything we blog  everything we Tweet  and everything we click is a public act of making media. We are the new editors. We decide what gets attention based on what we give our attention to. That's how the media works now. There's all these hidden algorithms that decide what you see more of and what we all see more of based on what you click on  and that in turn shapes our whole culture. Over three out of five Americans think we have a major incivility problem in our country right now  but I'm going to guess that at least three out of five Americans are clicking on the same insult oriented  rumor mongering trash that feeds the nastiest impulses in our society. In an increasingly noisy media landscape  the incentive is to make more noise to be heard  and that tyranny of the loud encourages the tyranny of the nasty. It does not have to be that way. It does not. We can change the incentive. For starters  there are two things we can all do. First  don't just stand by the sidelines when you see someone getting hurt. If someone is being abused online  do something. Be a hero. This is your chance. Speak up. Speak out. Be a good person. Drown out the negative with the positive. And second  we've got to stop clicking on the lowest common denominator  bottom feeding linkbait. If you don't like the      all Kardashian all the time programming  you've got to stop clicking on the stories about Kim Kardashian's sideboob. I know you do it.  Applause  You too  apparently. I mean  really  same example  if you don't like politicians calling each other names  stop clicking on the stories about what one guy in one party called the other guy in the other party. Clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it. It makes it worse  the fire spreads. Our whole culture gets burned.

How many times have you used the word  awesome  today  Once  Twice  Seventeen times  Do you remember what you were describing when you used the word  No  I didn't think so  because it's come down to this  people  You're using the word incorrectly  and tonight I hope to show you how to put the  awe  back in  awesome.  Recently  I was dining at an outdoor cafe  and the server came up to our table  and asked us if we had dined there before  and I said   Yes  yes  we have.  And she said   Awesome.  And I thought   Really  Awesome or just merely good that we decided to visit your restaurant again   The other day  one of my coworkers asked me if I could save that file as a PDF  and I said   Well  of course   and he said   Awesome.  Seriously  can saving anything as a PDF be awesome  Sadly  the frequent overuse of the word  awesome  has now replaced words like  great  and  thank you.  So Webster's dictionary defines the word  awesome  as fear mingled with admiration or reverence  a feeling produced by something majestic. Now  with that in mind  was your Quiznos sandwich awesome  How about that parking space  Was that awesome  Or that game the other day  Was that awesome  The answer is no  no and no. A sandwich can be delicious  that parking space can be nearby  and that game can be a blowout  but not everything can be awesome. So when you use the word  awesome  to describe the most mundane of things  you're taking away the very power of the word. This author says   Snowy days or finding money in your pants is awesome.  Um  no  it is not  and we need to raise the bar for this poor schmuck.  Laughter  So in other words  if you have everything  you value nothing. It's a lot like drinking from a firehose like this jackass right here. There's no dynamic  there's no highs or lows  if everything is awesome. Ladies and gentlemen  here are    things that are truly awesome. Imagine  if you will  having to schlep everything on your back. Wouldn't this be easier for me if I could roll this home  Yes  so I think I'll invent the wheel. The wheel  ladies and gentlemen. Is the wheel awesome  Say it with me. Yes  the wheel is awesome  The Great Pyramids were the tallest man made structure in the world for       years. Pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone. Were the Great Pyramids awesome  Yes  the pyramids were awesome. The Grand Canyon. Come on. It's almost    million years old. Is the Grand Canyon awesome  Yes  the Grand Canyon is. Louis Daguerre invented photography in       and earlier today  when you whipped out your smartphone and you took a shot of your awesome sandwich  and you know who you are   wasn't that easier than exposing the image to copper plates coated with iodized silver  I mean  come on. Is photography awesome  Yes  photography is awesome. D Day  June          the Allied invasion of Normandy  the largest amphibious invasion in world history. Was D Day awesome  Yes  it was awesome. Did you eat food today  Did you eat  Then you can thank the honeybee  that's the one  because if crops aren't pollinated  we can't grow food  and then we're all going to die. It's just like that. But it's not like a flower can just get up and have sex with another flower  although that would be awesome. Bees are awesome. Are you kidding me  Landing on the moon  Come on  Apollo   . Are you kidding me  Sixty six years after the Wright Brothers took off from Kitty Hawk  North Carolina  Neil Armstrong was         miles away. That's like from here to the moon. That's one small step for a man  one giant leap for awesome  You're damn right  it was. Woodstock        Rolling Stone Magazine said this changed the history of rock and roll. Tickets were only    dollars back then. You can't even buy a freaking t shirt for that now. Jimi Hendrix's version of  The Star Spangled Banner  was the most iconic. Was Woodstock awesome  Yes  it was awesome. Sharks  They're at the top of the food chain. Sharks have multiple rows of teeth that grow in their jaw and they move forward like a conveyor belt. Some sharks can lose        teeth in their lifetime. Does awesome inspire fear  Oh  hell yeah  sharks are awesome  The Internet was born in      and it instantly took over global communication  and later tonight  when all these PowerPoints are uplifted to the Internet so that a guy in Siberia can get drunk and watch this crap  the Internet is awesome. And finally  finally some of you can't wait to come up and tell me how awesome my PowerPoint was. I will save you the time. It was not awesome  but it was true  and I hope it was entertaining  and out of all the audiences I've ever had  y'all are the most recent. Thank you and good night. Why does the universe exist  Why is there   Okay. Okay.  Laughter  This is a cosmic mystery. Be solemn. Why is there a world  why are we in it  and why is there something rather than nothing at all  I mean  this is the super ultimate  why  question  So I'm going to talk about the mystery of existence  the puzzle of existence  where we are now in addressing it  and why you should care  and I hope you do care. The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said that those who don't wonder about the contingency of their existence  of the contingency of the world's existence  are mentally deficient. That's a little harsh  but still.  Laughter  So this has been called the most sublime and awesome mystery  the deepest and most far reaching question man can pose. It's obsessed great thinkers. Ludwig Wittgenstein  perhaps the greatest philosopher of the   th century  was astonished that there should be a world at all. He wrote in his  Tractatus   Proposition  .     It is not how things are in the world that is the mystical  it's that the world exists.  And if you don't like taking your epigrams from a philosopher  try a scientist. John Archibald Wheeler  one of the great physicists of the   th century  the teacher of Richard Feynman  the coiner of the term  black hole   he said   I want to know how come the quantum  how come the universe  how come existence   And my friend Martin Amis   sorry that I'll be doing a lot of name dropping in this talk  so get used to it   my dear friend Martin Amis once said that we're about five Einsteins away from answering the mystery of where the universe came from. And I've no doubt there are five Einsteins in the audience tonight. Any Einsteins  Show of hands  No  No  No  No Einsteins  Okay. So this question  why is there something rather than nothing  this sublime question  was posed rather late in intellectual history. It was towards the end of the   th century  the philosopher Leibniz who asked it  a very smart guy  Leibniz  who invented the calculus independently of Isaac Newton  at about the same time  but for Leibniz  who asked why is there something rather than nothing  this was not a great mystery. He either was or pretended to be an Orthodox Christian in his metaphysical outlook  and he said it's obvious why the world exists  because God created it. And God created  indeed  out of nothing at all. That's how powerful God is. He doesn't need any preexisting materials to fashion a world out of. He can make it out of sheer nothingness  creation ex nihilo. And by the way  this is what most Americans today believe. There is no mystery of existence for them. God made it. So let's put this in an equation. I don't have any slides so I'm going to mime my visuals  so use your imaginations. So it's God   nothing   the world. Okay  Now that's the equation. And so maybe you don't believe in God. Maybe you're a scientific atheist or an unscientific atheist  and you don't believe in God  and you're not happy with it. By the way  even if we have this equation  God   nothing   the world  there's already a problem  Why does God exist  God doesn't exist by logic alone unless you believe the ontological argument  and I hope you don't  because it's not a good argument. So it's conceivable  if God were to exist  he might wonder  I'm eternal  I'm all powerful  but where did I come from  Whence then am I  God speaks in a more formal English. And so one theory is that God was so bored with pondering the puzzle of His own existence that He created the world just to distract himself. But anyway  let's forget about God. Take God out of the equation  We have            nothing   the world. Now  if you're a Buddhist  you might want to stop right there  because essentially what you've got is nothing   the world  and by symmetry of identity  that means the world   nothing. Okay  And to a Buddhist  the world is just a whole lot of nothing. It's just a big cosmic vacuity. And we think there's a lot of something out there but that's because we're enslaved by our desires. If we let our desires melt away  we'll see the world for what it truly is  a vacuity  nothingness  and we'll slip into this happy state of nirvana which has been defined as having just enough life to enjoy being dead.  Laughter  So that's the Buddhist thinking. But I'm a Westerner  and I'm still concerned with the puzzle of existence  so I've got              this is going to get serious in a minute  so              nothing   the world. What are we going to put in that blank  Well  how about science  Science is our best guide to the nature of reality  and the most fundamental science is physics. That tells us what naked reality really is  that reveals what I call TAUFOTU  the True And Ultimate Furniture Of The Universe. So maybe physics can fill this blank  and indeed  since about the late     s or around       physicists have purported to give a purely scientific explanation of how a universe like ours could have popped into existence out of sheer nothingness  a quantum fluctuation out of the void. Stephen Hawking is one of these physicists  more recently Alex Vilenkin  and the whole thing has been popularized by another very fine physicist and friend of mine  Lawrence Krauss  who wrote a book called  A Universe from Nothing   and Lawrence thinks that he's given   he's a militant atheist  by the way  so he's gotten God out of the picture. The laws of quantum field theory  the state of the art physics  can show how out of sheer nothingness  no space  no time  no matter  nothing  a little nugget of false vacuum can fluctuate into existence  and then  by the miracle of inflation  blow up into this huge and variegated cosmos we see around us. Okay  this is a really ingenious scenario. It's very speculative. It's fascinating. But I've got a big problem with it  and the problem is this  It's a pseudo religious point of view. Now  Lawrence thinks he's an atheist  but he's still in thrall to a religious worldview. He sees physical laws as being like divine commands. The laws of quantum field theory for him are like fiat lux   Let there be light.  The laws have some sort of ontological power or clout that they can form the abyss  that it's pregnant with being. They can call a world into existence out of nothing. But that's a very primitive view of what a physical law is  right  We know that physical laws are actually generalized descriptions of patterns and regularities in the world. They don't exist outside the world. They don't have any ontic cloud of their own. They can't call a world into existence out of nothingness. That's a very primitive view of what a scientific law is. And if you don't believe me on this  listen to Stephen Hawking  who himself put forward a model of the cosmos that was self contained  didn't require any outside cause  any creator  and after proposing this  Hawking admitted that he was still puzzled. He said  this model is just equations. What breathes fire into the equations and creates a world for them to describe  He was puzzled by this  so equations themselves can't do the magic  can't resolve the puzzle of existence. And besides  even if the laws could do that  why this set of laws  Why quantum field theory that describes a universe with a certain number of forces and particles and so forth  Why not a completely different set of laws  There are many  many mathematically consistent sets of laws. Why not no laws at all  Why not sheer nothingness  So this is a problem  believe it or not  that reflective physicists really think a lot about  and at this point they tend to go metaphysical  say  well  maybe the set of laws that describes our universe  it's just one set of laws and it describes one part of reality  but maybe every consistent set of laws describes another part of reality  and in fact all possible physical worlds really exist  they're all out there. We just see a little tiny part of reality that's described by the laws of quantum field theory  but there are many  many other worlds  parts of reality that are described by vastly different theories that are different from ours in ways we can't imagine  that are inconceivably exotic. Steven Weinberg  the father of the standard model of particle physics  has actually flirted with this idea himself  that all possible realities actually exist. Also  a younger physicist  Max Tegmark  who believes that all mathematical structures exist  and mathematical existence is the same thing as physical existence  so we have this vastly rich multiverse that encompasses every logical possibility. Now  in taking this metaphysical way out  these physicists and also philosophers are actually reaching back to a very old idea that goes back to Plato. It's the principle of plenitude or fecundity  or the great chain of being  that reality is actually as full as possible. It's as far removed from nothingness as it could possibly be. So we have these two extremes now. We have sheer nothingness on one side  and we have this vision of a reality that encompasses every conceivable world at the other extreme  the fullest possible reality  nothingness  the simplest possible reality. Now what's in between these two extremes  There are all kinds of intermediate realities that include some things and leave out others. So one of these intermediate realities is  say  the most mathematically elegant reality  that leaves out the inelegant bits  the ugly asymmetries and so forth. Now  there are some physicists who will tell you that we're actually living in the most elegant reality. I think that Brian Greene is in the audience  and he has written a book called  The Elegant Universe.  He claims that the universe we live in mathematically is very elegant. Don't believe him.  Laughter  It's a pious hope  I wish it were true  but I think the other day he admitted to me it's really an ugly universe. It's stupidly constructed  it's got way too many arbitrary coupling constants and mass ratios and superfluous families of elementary particles  and what the hell is dark energy  It's a stick and bubble gum contraption. It's not an elegant universe.  Laughter  And then there's the best of all possible worlds in an ethical sense. You should get solemn now  because a world in which sentient beings don't suffer needlessly  in which there aren't things like childhood cancer or the Holocaust. This is an ethical conception. Anyway  so between nothingness and the fullest possible reality  various special realities. Nothingness is special. It's the simplest. Then there's the most elegant possible reality. That's special. The fullest possible reality  that's special. But what are we leaving out here  There's also just the crummy  generic realities that aren't special in any way  that are sort of random. They're infinitely removed from nothingness  but they fall infinitely short of complete fullness. They're a mixture of chaos and order  of mathematical elegance and ugliness. So I would describe these realities as an infinite  mediocre  incomplete mess  a generic reality  a kind of cosmic junk shot. And these realities  is there a deity in any of these realities  Maybe  but the deity isn't perfect like the Judeo Christian deity. The deity isn't all good and all powerful. It might be instead     percent malevolent but only    percent effective  which pretty much describes the world we see around us  I think.  Laughter  So I would like to propose that the resolution to the mystery of existence is that the reality we exist in is one of these generic realities. Reality has to turn out some way. It can either turn out to be nothing or everything or something in between. So if it has some special feature  like being really elegant or really full or really simple  like nothingness  that would require an explanation. But if it's just one of these random  generic realities  there's no further explanation for it. And indeed  I would say that's the reality we live in. That's what science is telling us. At the beginning of the week  we got the exciting information that the theory of inflation  which predicts a big  infinite  messy  arbitrary  pointless reality  it's like a big frothing champagne coming out of a bottle endlessly  a vast universe  mostly a wasteland with little pockets of charm and order and peace  this has been confirmed  this inflationary scenario  by the observations made by radio telescopes in Antarctica that looked at the signature of the gravitational waves from just before the Big Bang. I'm sure you all know about this. So anyway  I think there's some evidence that this really is the reality that we're stuck with. Now  why should you care  Well    Laughter    the question   Why does the world exist   that's the cosmic question  it sort of rhymes with a more intimate question  Why do I exist  Why do you exist  you know  our existence would seem to be amazingly improbable  because there's an enormous number of genetically possible humans  if you can compute it by looking at the number of the genes and the number of alleles and so forth  and a back of the envelope calculation will tell you there are about    to the       th possible humans  genetically. That's between a googol and a googolplex. And the number of the actual humans that have existed is     billion  maybe    billion  an infinitesimal fraction  so all of us  we've won this amazing cosmic lottery. We're here. Okay. So what kind of reality do we want to live in  Do we want to live in a special reality  What if we were living in the most elegant possible reality  Imagine the existential pressure on us to live up to that  to be elegant  not to pull down the tone of it. Or  what if we were living in the fullest possible reality  Well then our existence would be guaranteed  because every possible thing exists in that reality  but our choices would be meaningless. If I really struggle morally and agonize and I decide to do the right thing  what difference does it make  because there are an infinite number of versions of me also doing the right thing and an infinite number doing the wrong thing. So my choices are meaningless. So we don't want to live in that special reality. And as for the special reality of nothingness  we wouldn't be having this conversation. So I think living in a generic reality that's mediocre  there are nasty bits and nice bits and we could make the nice bits bigger and the nasty bits smaller and that gives us a kind of purpose in life. The universe is absurd  but we can still construct a purpose  and that's a pretty good one  and the overall mediocrity of reality kind of resonates nicely with the mediocrity we all feel in the core of our being. And I know you feel it. I know you're all special  but you're still kind of secretly mediocre  don't you think  So anyway  you may say  this  puzzle  the mystery of existence  it's just silly mystery mongering. You're not astonished at the existence of the universe and you're in good company. Bertrand Russell said   I should say the universe is just there  and that's all.  Just a brute fact. And my professor at Columbia  Sidney Morgenbesser  a great philosophical wag  when I said to him   Professor Morgenbesser  why is there something rather than nothing   And he said   Oh  even if there was nothing  you still wouldn't be satisfied.  So    Laughter    okay. So you're not astonished. I don't care. But I will tell you something to conclude that I guarantee you will astonish you  because it's astonished all of the brilliant  wonderful people I've met at this TED conference  when I've told them  and it's this  Never in my life have I had a cell phone. Thank you. Hi  kids. I'm   . My husband is   . My parents are in their late   s  and Olivia  the dog  is   . So let's talk about aging. Let me tell you how I feel when I see my wrinkles in the mirror and I realize that some parts of me have dropped and I can't find them down there. Mary Oliver says in one of her poems   Tell me  what is it that you plan to do with your one wild and precious life   Me  I intend to live passionately. When do we start aging  Society decides when we are old  usually around     when we get Medicare  but we really start aging at birth. We are aging right now  and we all experience it differently. We all feel younger than our real age  because the spirit never ages. I am still   . Sophia Loren. Look at her. She says that everything you see she owes to spaghetti. I tried it and gained    pounds in the wrong places. But attitude  aging is also attitude and health. But my real mentor in this journey of aging is Olga Murray. This California girl at    started working in Nepal to save young girls from domestic bondage. At     she has saved        girls  and she has changed the culture in the country. Now it is illegal for fathers to sell their daughters into servitude. She has also founded orphanages and nutritional clinics. She is always happy and eternally young. What have I lost in the last decades  People  of course  places  and the boundless energy of my youth  and I'm beginning to lose independence  and that scares me. Ram Dass says that dependency hurts  but if you accept it  there is less suffering. After a very bad stroke  his ageless soul watches the changes in the body with tenderness  and he is grateful to the people who help him. What have I gained  Freedom  I don't have to prove anything anymore. I'm not stuck in the idea of who I was  who I want to be  or what other people expect me to be. I don't have to please men anymore  only animals. I keep telling my superego to back off and let me enjoy what I still have. My body may be falling apart  but my brain is not  yet. I love my brain. I feel lighter. I don't carry grudges  ambition  vanity  none of the deadly sins that are not even worth the trouble. It's great to let go. I should have started sooner. And I also feel softer because I'm not scared of being vulnerable. I don't see it as weakness anymore. And I've gained spirituality. I'm aware that before  death was in the neighborhood. Now  it's next door  or in my house. I try to live mindfully and be present in the moment. By the way  the Dalai Lama is someone who has aged beautifully  but who wants to be vegetarian and celibate  Meditation helps. Isabel Allende  Ommm. Ommm. There it is. And it's good to start early. You know  for a vain female like myself  it's very hard to age in this culture. Inside  I feel good  I feel charming  seductive  sexy. Nobody else sees that.  Laughter  I'm invisible. I want to be the center of attention. I hate to be invisible. This is Grace Dammann. She has been in a wheelchair for six years after a terrible car accident. She says that there is nothing more sensual than a hot shower  that every drop of water is a blessing to the senses. She doesn't see herself as disabled. In her mind  she's still surfing in the ocean. Ethel Seiderman  a feisty  beloved activist in the place where I live in California. She wears red patent shoes  and her mantra is that one scarf is nice but two is better. She has been a widow for nine years  but she's not looking for another mate. She says that there is only a limited number of ways you can screw   well  she says it in another way   and she has tried them all. I  on the other hand  I still have erotic fantasies with Antonio Banderas   and my poor husband has to put up with it. So how can I stay passionate  I cannot will myself to be passionate at   . I have been training for some time  and when I feel flat and bored  I fake it. Attitude  attitude. How do I train  I train by saying yes to whatever comes my way  drama  comedy  tragedy  love  death  losses. Yes to life. And I train by trying to stay in love. It doesn't always work  but you cannot blame me for trying. And  on a final note  retirement in Spanish is jubilaci n. Jubilation. Celebration. We have paid our dues. We have contributed to society. Now it's our time  and it's a great time. Unless you are ill or very poor  you have choices. I have chosen to stay passionate  engaged with an open heart. I am working on it every day. Want to join me  Thank you. June Cohen  So Isabel   IA  Thank you. JC  First of all  I never like to presume to speak for the TED community  but I would like to tell you that I have a feeling we can all agree that you are still charming  seductive and sexy. Yes  IA  Aww  thank you.  Applause  JC  Hands down. IA  No  it's makeup. Moderator  Now  would it be awkward if I asked you a follow up question about your erotic fantasies  IA  Oh  of course. About what  Moderator  About your erotic fantasies. IA  With Antonio Banderas. Moderator  I was just wondering if you have anything more to share. IA  Well  one of them is that    Laughter  One of them is that I place a naked Antonio Banderas on a Mexican tortilla  I slather him with guacamole and salsa  I roll him up  and I eat him.  Laughter  Thank you. I'm an industrial engineer. The goal in my life has always been to make more and more products in the least amount of time and resources. While working at Toyota  all I knew was how to make cars until I met Dr. Akira Miyawaki  who came to our factory to make a forest in it in order to make it carbon neutral. I was so fascinated that I decided to learn this methodology by joining his team as a volunteer. Soon  I started making a forest in the backyard of my own house  and this is how it looks after three years. These forests  compared to a conventional plantation  grow    times faster  they're    times more dense  and     times more biodiverse. Within two years of having this forest in our backyard  I could observe that the groundwater didn't dry during summers  the number of bird species I spotted in this area doubled. Quality of air became better  and we started harvesting seasonal fruits growing effortlessly right in the backyard of our house. I wanted to make more of these forests. I was so moved by these results that I wanted to make these forests with the same acumen with which we make cars or write software or do any mainstream business  so I founded a company which is an end to end service provider to create these native natural forests. But to make afforestation as a mainstream business or an industry  we had to standardize the process of forest making. So we benchmarked the Toyota Production System known for its quality and efficiency for the process of forest making. For an example  the core of TPS  Toyota Production System  lies in heijunka  which is making manufacturing of different models of cars on a single assembly line. We replaced these cars with trees  using which now we can make multi layered forests. These forests utilize     percent vertical space. They are so dense that one can't even walk into them. For an example  we can make a     tree forest in an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars. In order to reduce cost and our own carbon footprint  we started utilizing local biomass as soil amender and fertilizers. For example  coconut shells crushed in a machine mixed with rice straw  powder of rice husk mixed with organic manure is finally dumped in soil on which our forest is planted. Once planted  we use grass or rice straw to cover the soil so that all the water which goes into irrigation doesn't get evaporated back into the atmosphere. And using these simple improvisations  today we can make a forest for a cost as low as the cost of an iPhone. Today  we are making forests in houses  in schools  even in factories with the corporates. But that's not enough. There is a huge number of people who want to take matters into their own hands. So we let it happen. Today  we are working on an Internet based platform where we are going to share our methodology on an open source using which anyone and everyone can make their own forest without our physical presence being there  using our methodology. At the click of a button  they can get to know all the native species of their place. By installing a small hardware probe on site  we can do remote soil testing  using which we can give step by step instructions on forest making remotely. Also we can monitor the growth of this forest without being on site. This methodology  I believe  has a potential. By sharing  we can actually bring back our native forests. Now  when you go back home  if you see a barren piece of land  do remember that it can be a potential forest. Thank you very much. Thanks. This is a photograph of a man whom for many years I plotted to kill. This is my father  Clinton George  Bageye  Grant. He's called Bageye because he has permanent bags under his eyes. As a    year old  along with my siblings  I dreamt of scraping off the poison from fly killer paper into his coffee  grounded down glass and sprinkling it over his breakfast  loosening the carpet on the stairs so he would trip and break his neck. But come the day  he would always skip that loose step  he would always bow out of the house without so much as a swig of coffee or a bite to eat. And so for many years  I feared that my father would die before I had a chance to kill him. Up until our mother asked him to leave and not come back  Bageye had been a terrifying ogre. He teetered permanently on the verge of rage  rather like me  as you see. He worked nights at Vauxhall Motors in Luton and demanded total silence throughout the house  so that when we came home from school at      in the afternoon  we would huddle beside the TV  and rather like safe crackers  we would twiddle with the volume control knob on the TV so it was almost inaudible. And at times  when we were like this  so much  Shhh   so much  Shhh  going on in the house that I imagined us to be like the German crew of a U boat creeping along the edge of the ocean whilst up above  on the surface  HMS Bageye patrolled ready to drop death charges at the first sound of any disturbance. So that lesson was the lesson that  Do not draw attention to yourself either in the home or outside of the home.  Maybe it's a migrant lesson. We were to be below the radar  so there was no communication  really  between Bageye and us and us and Bageye  and the sound that we most looked forward to  you know when you're a child and you want your father to come home and it's all going to be happy and you're waiting for that sound of the door opening. Well the sound that we looked forward to was the click of the door closing  which meant he'd gone and would not come back. So for three decades  I never laid eyes on my father  nor he on me. We never spoke to each other for three decades  and then a couple of years ago  I decided to turn the spotlight on him.  You are being watched. Actually  you are. You are being watched.  That was his mantra to us  his children. Time and time again he would say this to us. And this was the     s  it was Luton  where he worked at Vauxhall Motors  and he was a Jamaican. And what he meant was  you as a child of a Jamaican immigrant are being watched to see which way you turn  to see whether you conform to the host nation's stereotype of you  of being feckless  work shy  destined for a life of crime. You are being watched  so confound their expectations of you. To that end  Bageye and his friends  mostly Jamaican  exhibited a kind of Jamaican bella figura  Turn your best side to the world  show your best face to the world. If you have seen some of the images of the Caribbean people arriving in the '  s and '  s  you might have noticed that a lot of the men wear trilbies. Now  there was no tradition of wearing trilbies in Jamaica. They invented that tradition for their arrival here. They wanted to project themselves in a way that they wanted to be perceived  so that the way they looked and the names that they gave themselves defined them. So Bageye is bald and has baggy eyes. Tidy Boots is very fussy about his footwear. Anxious is always anxious. Clock has one arm longer than the other. And my all time favorite was the guy they called Summerwear. When Summerwear came to this country from Jamaica in the early '  s  he insisted on wearing light summer suits  no matter the weather  and in the course of researching their lives  I asked my mom   Whatever became of Summerwear   And she said   He caught a cold and died.   Laughter  But men like Summerwear taught us the importance of style. Maybe they exaggerated their style because they thought that they were not considered to be quite civilized  and they transferred that generational attitude or anxiety onto us  the next generation  so much so that when I was growing up  if ever on the television news or radio a report came up about a black person committing some crime   a mugging  a murder  a burglary   we winced along with our parents  because they were letting the side down. You did not just represent yourself. You represented the group  and it was a terrifying thing to come to terms with  in a way  that maybe you were going to be perceived in the same light. So that was what needed to be challenged. Our father and many of his colleagues exhibited a kind of transmission but not receiving. They were built to transmit but not receive. We were to keep quiet. When our father did speak to us  it was from the pulpit of his mind. They clung to certainty in the belief that doubt would undermine them. But when I am working in my house and writing  after a day's writing  I rush downstairs and I'm very excited to talk about Marcus Garvey or Bob Marley and words are tripping out of my mouth like butterflies and I'm so excited that my children stop me  and they say   Dad  nobody cares.  But they do care  actually. They cross over. Somehow they find their way to you. They shape their lives according to the narrative of your life  as I did with my father and my mother  perhaps  and maybe Bageye did with his father. And that was clearer to me in the course of looking at his life and understanding  as they say  the Native Americans say   Do not criticize the man until you can walk in his moccasins.  But in conjuring his life  it was okay and very straightforward to portray a Caribbean life in England in the     s with bowls of plastic fruit  polystyrene ceiling tiles  settees permanently sheathed in their transparent covers that they were delivered in. But what's more difficult to navigate is the emotional landscape between the generations  and the old adage that with age comes wisdom is not true. With age comes the veneer of respectability and a veneer of uncomfortable truths. But what was true was that my parents  my mother  and my father went along with it  did not trust the state to educate me. So listen to how I sound. They determined that they would send me to a private school  but my father worked at Vauxhall Motors. It's quite difficult to fund a private school education and feed his army of children. I remember going on to the school for the entrance exam  and my father said to the priest   it was a Catholic school   he wanted a better  heducation  for the boy  but also  he  my father  never even managed to pass worms  never mind entrance exams. But in order to fund my education  he was going to have to do some dodgy stuff  so my father would fund my education by trading in illicit goods from the back of his car  and that was made even more tricky because my father  that's not his car by the way. My father aspired to have a car like that  but my father had a beaten up Mini  and he never  being a Jamaican coming to this country  he never had a driving license  he never had any insurance or road tax or MOT. He thought   I know how to drive  why do I need the state's validation   But it became a little tricky when we were stopped by the police  and we were stopped a lot by the police  and I was impressed by the way that my father dealt with the police. He would promote the policeman immediately  so that P.C. Bloggs became Detective Inspector Bloggs in the course of the conversation and wave us on merrily. So my father was exhibiting what we in Jamaica called  playing fool to catch wise.  But it lent also an idea that actually he was being diminished or belittled by the policeman   as a    year old boy  I saw that   but also there was an ambivalence towards authority. So on the one hand  there was a mocking of authority  but on the other hand  there was a deference towards authority  and these Caribbean people had an overbearing obedience towards authority  which is very striking  very strange in a way  because migrants are very courageous people. They leave their homes. My father and my mother left Jamaica and they traveled       miles  and yet they were infantilized by travel. They were timid  and somewhere along the line  the natural order was reversed. The children became the parents to the parent. The Caribbean people came to this country with a five year plan  they would work  some money  and then go back  but the five years became     the    became     and before you know it  you're changing the wallpaper  and at that point  you know you're here to stay. Although there's still the kind of temporariness that our parents felt about being here  but we children knew that the game was up. I think there was a feeling that they would not be able to continue with the ideals of the life that they expected. The reality was very much different. And also  that was true of the reality of trying to educate me. Having started the process  my father did not continue. It was left to my mother to educate me  and as George Lamming would say  it was my mother who fathered me. Even in his absence  that old mantra remained  You are being watched. But such ardent watchfulness can lead to anxiety  so much so that years later  when I was investigating why so many young black men were diagnosed with schizophrenia  six times more than they ought to be  I was not surprised to hear the psychiatrist say   Black people are schooled in paranoia.  And I wonder what Bageye would make of that. Now I also had a    year old son  and turned my attention to Bageye and I went in search of him. He was back in Luton  he was now     and I hadn't seen him for    odd years  and when he opened the door  I saw this tiny little man with lambent  smiling eyes  and he was smiling  and I'd never seen him smile. I was very disconcerted by that. But we sat down  and he had a Caribbean friend with him  talking some old time talk  and my father would look at me  and he looked at me as if I would miraculously disappear as I had arisen. And he turned to his friend  and he said   This boy and me have a deep  deep connection  deep  deep connection.  But I never felt that connection. If there was a pulse  it was very weak or hardly at all. And I almost felt in the course of that reunion that I was auditioning to be my father's son. When the book came out  it had fair reviews in the national papers  but the paper of choice in Luton is not The Guardian  it's the Luton News  and the Luton News ran the headline about the book   The Book That May Heal a    Year Old Rift.  And I understood that could also represent the rift between one generation and the next  between people like me and my father's generation  but there's no tradition in Caribbean life of memoirs or biographies. It was a tradition that you didn't chat about your business in public. But I welcomed that title  and I thought actually  yes  there is a possibility that this will open up conversations that we'd never had before. This will close the generation gap  perhaps. This could be an instrument of repair. And I even began to feel that this book may be perceived by my father as an act of filial devotion. Poor  deluded fool. Bageye was stung by what he perceived to be the public airing of his shortcomings. He was stung by my betrayal  and he went to the newspapers the next day and demanded a right of reply  and he got it with the headline  Bageye Bites Back.  And it was a coruscating account of my betrayal. I was no son of his. He recognized in his mind that his colors had been dragged through the mud  and he couldn't allow that. He had to restore his dignity  and he did so  and initially  although I was disappointed  I grew to admire that stance. There was still fire bubbling through his veins  even though he was    years old. And if it meant that we would now return to    years of silence  my father would say   If it's so  then it's so.  Jamaicans will tell you that there's no such thing as facts  there are only versions. We all tell ourselves the versions of the story that we can best live with. Each generation builds up an edifice which they are reluctant or sometimes unable to disassemble  but in the writing  my version of the story began to change  and it was detached from me. I lost my hatred of my father. I did no longer want him to die or to murder him  and I felt free  much freer than I'd ever felt before. And I wonder whether that freedness could be transferred to him. In that initial reunion  I was struck by an idea that I had very few photographs of myself as a young child. This is a photograph of me  nine months old. In the original photograph  I'm being held up by my father  Bageye  but when my parents separated  my mother excised him from all aspects of our lives. She took a pair of scissors and cut  him out of every photograph  and for years  I told myself the truth of this photograph was that you are alone  you are unsupported. But there's another way of looking at this photograph. This is a photograph that has the potential for a reunion  a potential to be reunited with my father  and in my yearning to be held up by my father  I held him up to the light. In that first reunion  it was very awkward and tense moments  and to lessen the tension  we decided to go for a walk. And as we walked  I was struck that I had reverted to being the child even though I was now towering above my father. I was almost a foot taller than my father. He was still the big man  and I tried to match his step. And I realized that he was walking as if he was still under observation  but I admired his walk. He walked like a man on the losing side of the F.A. Cup Final mounting the steps to collect his condolence medal. There was dignity in defeat. Thank you. On November  th        a man named El Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane  the leader of the Jewish Defense League. Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder  but while serving time on lesser charges  he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City landmarks  including tunnels  synagogues and the United Nations headquarters. Thankfully  those plans were foiled by an FBI informant. Sadly  the      bombing of the World Trade Center was not. Nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot. El Sayyid Nosair is my father. I was born in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania in      to him  an Egyptian engineer  and a loving American mother and grade school teacher  who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me. It wasn't until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change. My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people  including the majority of Muslims  get to see. It's been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another  it doesn't take long to realize that for the most part  we all want the same things out of life. However  in every religion  in every population  you'll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do. A few months prior to his arrest  he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends  he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice. He told me I'd be going with him the next morning. We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range  which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the FBI. When it was my turn to shoot  my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about    yards off. That day  the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone's surprise  especially mine  the entire target burst into flames. My uncle turned to the other men  and in Arabic said   Ibn abuh.  Like father  like son. They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment  but it wasn't until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny. They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of. Those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with       pounds of explosives into the sub level parking lot of the World Trade Center's North Tower  causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over       others. These were the men I looked up to. These were the men I called ammu  which means uncle. By the time I turned     I had already moved    times in my life  and that instability during my childhood didn't really provide an opportunity to make many friends. Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone  it was time to pack up and move to the next town. Being the perpetual new face in class  I was frequently the target of bullies. I kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted  but as it turns out  being the quiet  chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition. So for the most part  I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games. For those reasons  my social skills were lacking  to say the least  and growing up in a bigoted household  I wasn't prepared for the real world. I'd been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements  like a person's race or religion. So what opened my eyes  One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the      presidential elections. Through a college prep program  I was able to take part in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia. My particular group's focus was on youth violence  and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life  this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate. The members of our group came from many different walks of life. One day toward the end of the convention  I found out that one of the kids I had befriended was Jewish. Now  it had taken several days for this detail to come to light  and I realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us. I had never had a Jewish friend before  and frankly I felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insurmountable. Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Busch Gardens  an amusement park. There  I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures  and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character. Most of my life  I'd been taught that homosexuality was a sin  and by extension  that all gay people were a negative influence. As chance would have it  I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay performers at a show there  and soon found that many were the kindest  least judgmental people I had ever met. Being bullied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others  and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated. Because of that feeling  I was able to contrast the stereotypes I'd been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction. I don't know what it's like to be gay  but I'm well acquainted with being judged for something that's beyond my control. Then there was  The Daily Show.  On a nightly basis  Jon Stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry and helped me to realize that a person's race  religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of one's character. He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desperate need of one. Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place  and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me. One day  I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change  and she said something to me that I will hold dear to my heart for as long as I live. She looked at me with the weary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dogmatism to last a lifetime  and said   I'm tired of hating people.  In that instant  I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you. Zak Ebrahim is not my real name. I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life. So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger  Well  that's simple. I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way  that although I had been subjected to this violent  intolerant ideology  that I did not become fanaticized. Instead  I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism  against the bigotry. I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones  for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives. For the victims of terrorism  I will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father's actions. And with that simple fact  I stand here as proof that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race  and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father. I am not my father. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you  everybody.  Applause  Thank you all.  Applause  Thanks a lot.  Applause  My dream is to build the world's first underground park in New York City. Now  why would someone want to build an underground park  and why in New York City  These three tough little buggers are  on the left  my grandmother  age five  and then her sister and brother  ages    and nine. This photo was taken just before they left from Italy to immigrate to the United States  just about a century ago. And like many immigrants at the time  they arrived on the Lower East Side in New York City and they encountered a crazy melting pot. What was amazing about their generation was that they were not only building new lives in this new  unfamiliar area  but they were also literally building the city. I've always been fascinated by those decades and by that history  and I would often beg my grandmother to tell me as many stories as possible about the old New York. But she would often just shrug it off  tell me to eat more meatballs  more pasta  and so I very rarely got any of the history that I wanted to hear about. The New York City that I encountered felt pretty built up. I always knew as a kid that I wanted to make a difference  and to somehow make the world more beautiful  more interesting and more just. I just didn't really know how. At first  I thought I wanted to go work abroad  so I took a job with UNICEF in Kenya. But it felt weird to me that I knew more about local Kenyan politics than the politics of my own hometown. I took a job with the City of New York  but very quickly felt frustrated with the slowness of government bureaucracy. I even took a job at Google  where very fast I drank the Kool Aid and believed almost wholeheartedly that technology could solve all social problems. But I still didn't feel like I was making the world a better place. It was in      that my friend and now business partner James Ramsey alerted me to the location of a pretty spectacular site  which is this. This is the former trolley terminal that was the depot for passengers traveling over the Williamsburg Bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan  and it was open between      and       just around the time when my grandparents were living right in the area. And we learned also that the site was entirely abandoned in     . Fascinated by this discovery  we begged the authorities to draw us into the space  and we finally got a tour  and this is what we saw. Now  this photo doesn't really do it justice. It's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical feeling that you have when you get in this space. It's a football field of unused land immediately below a very crowded area of the city  and it almost feels like you're Indiana Jones on an archaeological dig  and all the details are all still there. It's really pretty remarkable. Now  the site itself is located at the very heart of the Lower East Side  and today it still remains one of the most crowded neighborhoods in the city. New York City has two thirds the green space per resident as other big cities  and this neighborhood as one tenth the green space. So we immediately started thinking about how we could take this site and turn it into something that could be used for the public  but also could potentially even be green. Our plan  in a nutshell  is to draw natural sunlight underground using a simple system that harvests sunlight above the street  directs it below the city sidewalks  and would allow plants and trees to grow with the light that's directed underneath. With this approach  you could take a site that looks like this today and transform it into something that looks like this. In       we first released some of these images  and what was funny was  a lot of people said to us   Oh  it kind of looks like the High Line underground.  And so what our nickname ended up becoming  and what ended up sticking  was the Lowline  so the Lowline was born. What was also clear was that people really wanted to know a lot more about how the technology would look and feel  and that there was really much more interest in this than we had ever thought possible. So  like a crazy person  I decided to quit my job and focus entirely on this project. Here is us with our team putting together a technology demonstration in a warehouse. Here's the underbelly of this solar canopy which we built to show the technology. You can see the six solar collectors at the center there. And here's the full exhibit all put together in this warehouse. You can see the solar canopy overhead  the light streaming in  and this entirely live green space below. So in the course of just a few weeks  tens of thousands of people came to see our exhibit  and since that time  we've grown our numbers of supporters both locally and among design enthusiasts all over the world. Here's a rendering of the neighborhood just immediately above the Line's site  and a rendering of how it will look after major redevelopment that is coming over the course of the next    years. Notice how crowded the neighborhood still feels and how there's really a lack of green space. So what we're proposing is really something that will add one football field of green space underneath this neighborhood  but more importantly will introduce a really community driven focus in a rapidly gentrifying area. And right now  we're focusing very closely on how we engage with the City of New York on really transforming the overall ecosystem in an integrated way. Here's our rendering of how we would actually invite people into the space itself. So here you see this iconic entrance in which we would literally peel up the street and reveal the historical layers of the city  and invite people into this warm underground space. In the middle of winter  when it's absolutely freezing outside  the last place you'd want to go would be an outdoor space or outdoor park. The Lowline would really be a four season space and a respite for the city. So I like to think that the Lowline actually brings my own family's story full circle. If my grandparents and my parents were really focused on building the city up and out  I think my generation is focused on reclaiming the spaces that we already have  rediscovering our shared history  and reimagining how we can make our communities more interesting  more beautiful and more just. Thanks. Hans Rosling  I'm going to ask you three multiple choice questions. Use this device. Use this device to answer. The first question is  how did the number of deaths per year from natural disaster  how did that change during the last century  Did it more than double  did it remain about the same in the world as a whole  or did it decrease to less than half  Please answer A  B or C. I see lots of answers. This is much faster than I do it at universities. They are so slow. They keep thinking  thinking  thinking. Oh  very  very good. And we go to the next question. So how long did women    years old in the world go to school  seven years  five years or three years  A  B or C  Please answer. And we go to the next question. In the last    years  how did the percentage of people in the world who live in extreme poverty change  Extreme poverty   not having  enough food for the day. Did it almost double  did it remain more or less the same  or did it halve  A  B or C  Now  answers. You see  deaths from natural disasters in the world  you can see it from this graph here  from      to     . In       there was about half a million people who died every year from natural disasters  floods  earthquakes  volcanic  eruption  whatever  droughts. And then  how did that change  Gapminder asked the public in Sweden. This is how they answered. The Swedish public answered like this  Fifty percent thought it had doubled     percent said it's more or less the same     said it had halved. This is the best data from the disaster researchers  and it goes up and down  and it goes to the Second World War  and after that it starts to fall and it keeps falling and it's down to much less than half. The world has been much  much more capable as the decades go by to protect people from this  you know. So only    percent of the Swedes know this. So I went to the zoo and I asked the chimps. The chimps don't watch the evening news  so the chimps  they choose by random  so the Swedes answer worse than random. Now how did you do  That's you. You were beaten by the chimps. But it was close. You were three times better than the Swedes  but that's not enough. You shouldn't compare yourself to Swedes. You must have higher ambitions in the world. Let's look at the next answer here  women in school. Here  you can see men went eight years. How long did women go to school  Well  we asked the Swedes like this  and that gives you a hint  doesn't it  The right answer is probably the one the fewest Swedes picked  isn't it  Let's see  let's see. Here we come. Yes  yes  yes  women have almost caught up. This is the U.S. public. And this is you. Here you come. Ooh. Well  congratulations  you're twice as good as the Swedes  but you don't need me   So how come  I think it's like this  that everyone is aware that there are countries and there are areas where girls have great difficulties. They are stopped when they go to school  and it's disgusting. But in the majority of the world  where most people in the world live  most countries  girls today go to school as long as boys  more or less. That doesn't mean that gender equity is achieved  not at all. They still are confined to terrible  terrible limitations  but schooling is there in the world today. Now  we miss the majority. When you answer  you answer according to the worst places  and there you are right  but you miss the majority. What about poverty  Well  it's very clear that poverty here was almost halved  and in U.S.  when we asked the public  only five percent got it right. And you  Ah  you almost made it to the chimps. That little  just a few of you  There must be preconceived ideas  you know. And many in the rich countries  they think that oh  we can never end extreme poverty. Of course they think so  because they don't even know what has happened. The first thing to think about the future is to know about the present. These questions were a few of the first ones in the pilot phase of the Ignorance Project in Gapminder Foundation that we run  and it was started  this project  last year by my boss  and also my son  Ola Rosling.  Laughter  He's cofounder and director  and he wanted  Ola told me we have to be more systematic when we fight devastating ignorance. So already the pilots reveal this  that so many in the public score worse than random  so we have to think about preconceived ideas  and one of the main preconceived ideas is about world income distribution. Look here. This is how it was in     . It's the number of people on each income  from one dollar a day   See  there was one hump here  around one dollar a day  and then there was one hump here somewhere between    and     dollars. The world was two groups. It was a camel world  like a camel with two humps  the poor ones and the rich ones  and there were fewer in between. But look how this has changed  As I go forward  what has changed  the world population has grown  and the humps start to merge. The lower humps merged with the upper hump  and the camel dies and we have a dromedary world with one hump only. The percent in poverty has decreased. Still it's appalling that so many remain in extreme poverty. We still have this group  almost a billion  over there  but that can be ended now. The challenge we have now is to get away from that  understand where the majority is  and that is very clearly shown in this question. We asked  what is the percentage of the world's one year old children who have got those basic vaccines against measles and other things that we have had for many years         or    percent  Now  this is what the U.S. public and the Swedish answered. Look at the Swedish result  you know what the right answer is. Who the heck is a professor of global health in that country  Well  it's me. It's me. It's very difficult  this. It's very difficult. However  Ola's approach to really measure what we know made headlines  and CNN published these results on their web and they had the questions there  millions answered  and I think there were about       comments  and this was one of the comments.  I bet no member of the media passed the test   he said. So Ola told me   Take these devices. You are invited to media conferences. Give it to them and measure what the media know.  And ladies and gentlemen  for the first time  the informal results from a conference with U.S. media. And then  lately  from the European Union media. You see  the problem is not that people don't read and listen to the media. The problem is that the media doesn't know themselves. What shall we do about this  Ola  Do we have any ideas  Ola Rosling  Yes  I have an idea  but first  I'm so sorry that you were beaten by the chimps. Fortunately  I will be able to comfort you by showing why it was not your fault  actually. Then  I will equip you with some tricks for beating the chimps in the future. That's basically what I will do. But first  let's look at why are we so ignorant  and it all starts in this place. It's Hudiksvall. It's a city in northern Sweden. It's a neighborhood where I grew up  and it's a neighborhood with a large problem. Actually  it has exactly the same problem which existed in all the neighborhoods where you grew up as well. It was not representative. Okay  It gave me a very biased view of how life is on this planet. So this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle. We have a personal bias. We have all different experiences from communities and people we meet  and on top of this  we start school  and we add the next problem. Well  I like schools  but teachers tend to teach outdated worldviews  because they learned something when they went to school  and now they describe this world to the students without any bad intentions  and those books  of course  that are printed are outdated in a world that changes. And there is really no practice to keep the teaching material up to date. So that's what we are focusing on. So we have these outdated facts added on top of our personal bias. What happens next is news  okay  An excellent journalist knows how to pick the story that will make headlines  and people will read it because it's sensational. Unusual events are more interesting  no  And they are exaggerated  and especially things we're afraid of. A shark attack on a Swedish person will get headlines for weeks in Sweden. So these three skewed sources of information were really hard to get away from. They kind of bombard us and equip our mind with a lot of strange ideas  and on top of it we put the very thing that makes us humans  our human intuition. It was good in evolution. It helped us generalize and jump to conclusions very  very fast. It helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of  and we seek causality where there is none  and we then get an illusion of confidence where we believe that we are the best car drivers  above the average. Everybody answered that question   Yeah  I drive cars better.  Okay  this was good evolutionarily  but now when it comes to the worldview  it is the exact reason why it's upside down. The trends that are increasing are instead falling  and the other way around  and in this case  the chimps use our intuition against us  and it becomes our weakness instead of our strength. It was supposed to be our strength  wasn't it  So how do we solve such problems  First  we need to measure it  and then we need to cure it. So by measuring it we can understand what is the pattern of ignorance. We started the pilot last year  and now we're pretty sure that we will encounter a lot of ignorance across the whole world  and the idea is really to scale it up to all domains or dimensions of global development  such as climate  endangered species  human rights  gender equality  energy  finance. All different sectors have facts  and there are organizations trying to spread awareness about these facts. So I've started actually contacting some of them  like WWF and Amnesty International and UNICEF  and asking them  what are your favorite facts which you think the public doesn't know  Okay  I gather those facts. Imagine a long list with  say      facts. And then we poll the public and see where they score worst. So we get a shorter list with the terrible results  like some few examples from Hans  and we have no problem finding these kinds of terrible results. Okay  this little shortlist  what are we going to do with it  Well  we turn it into a knowledge certificate  a global knowledge certificate  which you can use  if you're a large organization  a school  a university  or maybe a news agency  to certify yourself as globally knowledgeable. Basically meaning  we don't hire people who score like chimpanzees. Of course you shouldn't. So maybe    years from now  if this project succeeds  you will be sitting in an interview having to fill out this crazy global knowledge. So now we come to the practical tricks. How are you going to succeed  There is  of course  one way  which is to sit down late nights and learn all the facts by heart by reading all these reports. That will never happen  actually. Not even Hans thinks that's going to happen. People don't have that time. People like shortcuts  and here are the shortcuts. We need to turn our intuition into strength again. We need to be able to generalize. So now I'm going to show you some tricks where the misconceptions are turned around into rules of thumb. Let's start with the first misconception. This is very widespread. Everything is getting worse. You heard it. You thought it yourself. The other way to think is  most things improve. So you're sitting with a question in front of you and you're unsure. You should guess  improve.  Okay  Don't go for the worse. That will help you score better on our tests. That was the first one. There are rich and poor and the gap is increasing. It's a terrible inequality. Yeah  it's an unequal world  but when you look at the data  it's one hump. Okay  If you feel unsure  go for  the most people are in the middle.  That's going to help you get the answer right. Now  the next preconceived idea is first countries and people need to be very  very rich to get the social development like girls in school and be ready for natural disasters. No  no  no. That's wrong. Look  that huge hump in the middle already have girls in school. So if you are unsure  go for the  the majority already have this   like electricity and girls in school  these kinds of things. They're only rules of thumb  so of course they don't apply to everything  but this is how you can generalize. Let's look at the last one. If something  yes  this is a good one  sharks are dangerous. No   well  yes  but they are not so important in the global statistics  that is what I'm saying. I actually  I'm very afraid of sharks. So as soon as I see a question about things I'm afraid of  which might be earthquakes  other religions  maybe I'm afraid of terrorists or sharks  anything that makes me feel  assume you're going to exaggerate the problem. That's a rule of thumb. Of course there are dangerous  things that are also great. Sharks kill very  very few. That's how you should think. With these four rules of thumb  you could probably answer better than the chimps  because the chimps cannot do this. They cannot generalize these kinds of rules. And hopefully we can turn your world around and we're going to beat the chimps. Okay  That's a systematic approach. Now the question  is this important  Yeah  it's important to understand poverty  extreme poverty and how to fight it  and how to bring girls in school. When we realize that actually it's succeeding  we can understand it. But is it important for everyone else who cares about the rich end of this scale  I would say yes  extremely important  for the same reason. If you have a fact based worldview of today  you might have a chance to understand what's coming next in the future. We're going back to these two humps in     . That's when I was born  and I selected the West. That's the current EU countries and North America. Let's now see how the rest and the West compares in terms of how rich you are. These are the people who can afford to fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation. In       only    percent of them lived outside EU and North America. But this has changed  okay  So first  let's look at the change up till today      . Today it's      . The Western domination is over  as of today. That's nice. So what's going to happen next  Do you see the big hump  Did you see how it moved  I did a little experiment. I went to the IMF  International Monetary Fund  website. They have a forecast for the next  five years of GDP per capita. So I can use that to go five years into the future  assuming the income inequality  of each country is the same. I did that  but I went even further. I used those five years for the next    years with the same speed  just as an  experiment what might actually happen. Let's move into the future. In       it's    percent in the rest. In          percent.         . And in       the West is  outnumbered in the rich consumer market. These are just projections of  GDP per capita into the future. Seventy three percent of the rich consumers are going to live outside North America and Europe. So yes  I think it's a good idea for  a company to use this certificate to make sure to make fact  based decisions in the future. Thank you very much. Bruno Giussani  Hans and Ola Rosling  Good afternoon. My name is Uldus. I am a photo based artist from Russia. I started my way around six years ago with ironic self portraits to lay open so many stereotypes about nationalities  genders  and social issues     I am Russian. I sell drugs  guns  porno with kids      Vodka   water. I love vodka     Laughter    using photography as my tool to send a message.   Marry me  I need a visa.   Today  I am still performing in front of the camera and trying to be brave like Wonder Woman. I focus on balancing meaningful message  aesthetic  beauty  composition   some irony  and artifacts. Today  I'm going to tell you about my project  which is named Desperate Romantics. They're my artifacts  or paintings from pre Raphaelites Brotherhood England mid   th century. I took the painting and gifted new  contemporary meaning talking about issues which are surrounding me in Russia  capturing people who are non models but have an interesting story. This boy is a professional dancer  only    years old  but at secondary school  he hides his dancing classes and is wearing the mask of brutality  trying to be united with the rest of his classmates like a storm trooper has no personality. But this boy has goals and dreams but hides it to be socially accepted  because being different isn't easy  especially in Russia. Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric. And this is Nikita  a security guard from one of the bars in St. Petersburg. He likes to say   You wouldn't like me when I'm angry   quoting Hulk from the movie  but I've never seen him angry. He hides his sensitivities and romantic side  because in Russia  among guys  that's not cool to be romantic  but it's cool to be surrounded with women and look like an aggressive hulk. Sometimes  in my project  I would take the painting and give it new meaning and new temptation about it. Sometimes  I would compare facial features and playing with words  irony  Iron Man  ironing man. Through the artifacts  I bring social issues which surround me in Russia into the conversation. Interesting fact about marriage in Russia  that most of the        year old girls are already ready  and dream to get married. We're taught from childhood  successful marriage means successful life  so most of the girls kind of fight to get a good husband. And what about me  I'm    years old. For Russian society  I'm an old maid and hopeless to ever get married. That's why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask  in the wedding dress  all desperate in my garden. But remember  irony is the key  and this is actually to motivate girls to fight for goals  for dreams  and change stereotypes. Be brave. Be ironic   it helps. Be funny and create some magic. For over a decade as a doctor  I've cared for homeless veterans  for working class families. I've cared for people who  live and work in conditions that can be hard  if not harsh  and that work has led me to believe that we need a fundamentally different way of looking at healthcare. We simply need a healthcare system that moves beyond just looking at the symptoms that bring people into clinics  but instead actually is able to look and improve health where it begins. And where health begins is not in the four walls of a doctor's office  but where we live and where we work  where we eat  sleep  learn and play  where we spend the majority of our lives. So what does this different  approach to healthcare look like  an approach that can improve health where it begins  To illustrate this  I'll tell you about Veronica. Veronica was the   th patient out of my    patient day at that clinic in South Central Los Angeles. She came into our clinic with a chronic headache. This headache had been going on for a number of years  and this particular episode was very  very troubling. In fact  three weeks before she came to visit us for the first time  she went to an  emergency room in Los Angeles. The emergency room doctors said   We've run some tests  Veronica. The results are normal  so here's some pain medication  and follow up with a primary care doctor  but if the pain persists or if it worsens  then come on back.  Veronica followed those standard instructions and she went back. She went back not just once  but twice more. In the three weeks before Veronica met us  she went to the emergency room three times. She went back and forth  in and out of hospitals and clinics  just like she had done in years past  trying to seek relief but still coming up short. Veronica came to our clinic  and despite all these encounters with healthcare professionals  Veronica was still sick. When she came to our clinic  though   we tried a different approach. Our approach started with our medical assistant  someone who had a GED level training but knew the community. Our medical assistant asked some routine questions. She asked   What's your chief complaint    Headache.   Let's get your vital signs    measure your blood pressure and your heart rate  but let's also ask something equally as vital to Veronica and a lot of patients like her in South Los Angeles.  Veronica  can you tell me about where you live  Specifically  about your housing conditions  Do you have mold  Do you have water leaks  Do you have roaches in your home   Turns out  Veronica said yes to three of those things  roaches  water leaks  mold. I received that chart in hand  reviewed it  and I turned the handle on the door and I entered the room. You should understand that Veronica  like a lot of patients that I have the privilege of caring for  is a dignified person  a formidable presence  a personality that's larger than life  but here she was doubled over in pain sitting on my exam table. Her head  clearly throbbing  was resting in her hands. She lifted her head up  and I saw her face  said hello  and then I immediately noticed something across the bridge of her nose  a crease in her skin. In medicine  we call that crease the allergic salute. It's usually seen among children who have chronic allergies. It comes from chronically rubbing one's nose up and down  trying to get rid of those allergy symptoms  and yet  here was Veronica  a grown woman  with the same telltale sign of allergies. A few minutes later  in asking Veronica some questions  and examining her and listening to her  I said   Veronica  I think I know what you have. I think you have chronic allergies  and I think you have migraine headaches and some sinus congestion  and I think all of those are  related to where you live.  She looked a little bit relieved  because for the first time  she had a diagnosis  but I said   Veronica  now let's talk about your treatment. We're going to order some medications for your symptoms  but I also want to refer you to a specialist  if that's okay.  Now  specialists are a little hard to find in South Central Los Angeles  so she gave me this look  like   Really   And I said   Veronica  actually  the specialist I'm talking about is someone I call a community health worker  someone who  if it's okay with you  can come to your home and try to understand what's going on with those water leaks and that mold  trying to help you manage those conditions in your housing that I think are causing your symptoms  and if required  that specialist might refer you to another specialist that we call a public interest lawyer  because it might be that your landlord isn't making the fixes he's required to make.  Veronica came back in a few months later. She agreed to all of those treatment plans. She told us that her symptoms had improved by    percent. She was spending more time at work and with her family and less time shuttling back and forth between the emergency rooms of Los Angeles. Veronica had improved remarkably. Her sons  one of whom had asthma  were no longer as sick as they used to be. She had gotten better  and not coincidentally  Veronica's home was better too. What was it about this different approach we tried that led to better care  fewer visits to the E.R.  better health  Well  quite simply  it started with that question   Veronica  where do you live   But more importantly  it was that we put in place a system that allowed us to routinely ask questions to Veronica and hundreds more like her about the conditions that mattered in her community  about where health  and unfortunately sometimes illness  do begin in places like South L.A. In that community  substandard housing and food insecurity are the major conditions that we as a clinic had to be aware of  but in other communities it could be transportation barriers  obesity  access to parks  gun violence. The important thing is  we put in place a system that worked  and it's an approach that I call an upstream approach. It's a term many of you are familiar with. It comes from a parable that's very common in the public health community. This is a parable of three friends. Imagine that you're one of these three friends who come to a river. It's a beautiful scene  but it's shattered by the cries of a child  and actually several children  in need of rescue in the water. So you do hopefully what everybody would do. You jump right in along with your friends. The first friend says  I'm going to rescue those who are about to drown  those at most risk of falling over the waterfall. The second friends says  I'm going to build a raft. I'm going to make sure that fewer people need to end up at the waterfall's edge. Let's usher more people to safety by building this raft  coordinating those branches together. Over time  they're successful  but not really  as much as they want to be. More people slip through  and they finally look up and they see that their third friend is nowhere to be seen. They finally spot her. She's in the water. She's swimming away from them upstream  rescuing children as she goes  and they shout to her   Where are you going  There are children here to save.  And she says back   I'm going to find out who or what is throwing these children in the water.  In healthcare  we have that first friend   we have the specialist  we have the trauma surgeon  the ICU nurse  the E.R. doctors. We have those people that are vital rescuers  people you want to be there when you're in dire straits. We also know that we have the second friend   we have that raft builder. That's the primary care clinician  people on the care team who are there to manage your chronic conditions  your diabetes  your hypertension  there to give you your annual checkups  there to make sure your vaccines are up to date  but also there to make sure that you have a raft to sit on and usher yourself to safety. But while that's also vital and very necessary  what we're missing is that third friend. We don't have enough of that upstreamist. The upstreamists are the health care professionals who know that health does begin where we live and work and play  but beyond that awareness  is able to mobilize the resources to create the system in their clinics and in their hospitals that really does start to approach that  to connect people to the resources they need outside the four walls of the clinic. Now you might ask  and it's  a very obvious question that a lot of colleagues in medicine ask   Doctors and nurses thinking about transportation and housing  Shouldn't we just provide pills and procedures and just make sure we focus on the task at hand   Certainly  rescuing people at the water's edge is important enough work. Who has the time  I would argue  though  that if we were to use science as our guide  that we would find an upstream approach is absolutely necessary. Scientists now know that the living and working conditions that we all are part of have more than twice the impact on our health than does our genetic code  and living and working conditions  the structures of our environments  the ways in which our social fabric is woven together  and the impact those have on our behaviors  all together  those have more than five times the impact on our health than do all the pills and procedures administered by doctors and hospitals combined. All together  living and working conditions account for    percent of preventable death. Let me give you an example of what this feels like. Let's say there was a company  a tech startup that came to you and said   We have a great product. It's going to lower your risk of death from heart disease.  Now  you might be likely to invest if that product was a drug or a device  but what if that product was a park  A study in the U.K.  a landmark study that reviewed the records of over    million residents in the U.K.  looked at several variables  controlled for a lot of factors  and found that when trying to adjust the risk of heart disease  one's exposure to green space was a powerful influence. The closer you were to green space  to parks and trees  the lower your chance of heart disease  and that stayed true for rich and for poor. That study illustrates what my friends in public health often say these days  that one's zip code matters more than your genetic code. We're also learning that zip code is actually shaping our genetic code. The science of epigenetics looks at those molecular mechanisms  those intricate ways in which our DNA is literally shaped  genes turned on and off based on the exposures to the environment  to where we live and to where we work. So it's clear that these factors  these upstream issues  do matter. They matter to our health  and therefore our healthcare professionals should do something about it. And yet  Veronica asked me perhaps the most compelling question I've been asked in a long time. In that follow up visit  she said   Why did none of my doctors ask about my home before  In those visits to the emergency room  I had two CAT scans  I had a needle placed in the lower part of my back to collect spinal fluid  I had nearly a dozen blood tests. I went back and forth  I saw all sorts of people in healthcare  and no one asked about my home.  The honest answer is that in healthcare  we often treat symptoms without addressing the conditions that make you sick in the first place. And there are many reasons for that  but the big three are first  we don't pay for that. In healthcare  we often pay  for volume and not value. We pay doctors and hospitals usually for the number of services they provide  but not necessarily on how healthy they make you. That leads to a second phenomenon that I call the  don't ask  don't tell  approach to upstream issues in healthcare. We don't ask about where you live and where you work  because if there's a problem there  we don't know what to tell you. It's not that doctors don't know these are important issues. In a recent survey done in the U.S. among physicians  over       physicians     percent of them actually said that they know that their patients' upstream problems are as important as their health issues  as their medical problems  and yet despite that widespread awareness of the importance of upstream issues  only one in five doctors said they had any sense of confidence to address those issues  to improve health where it begins. There's this gap between knowing that patients' lives  the context of where they live and work  matters  and the ability to do something about it in the systems in which we work. This is a huge problem right now  because it leads them to this next question  which is  whose responsibility is it  And that brings me to that third point  that third answer to Veronica's compelling question. Part of the reason that we have this conundrum is because there are not nearly enough upstreamists in the healthcare system. There are not nearly enough of that third friend  that person who is going to find out who or what is throwing those kids in the water. Now  there are many upstreamists  and I've had the privilege of meeting many of them  in Los Angeles and in other parts of the country and around the world  and it's important to note that upstreamists sometimes are doctors  but they need not be. They can be nurses  other clinicians  care managers  social workers. It's not so important what specific degree upstreamists have at the end of their name. What's more important is that they all seem to share the same ability to implement a process that transforms their assistance  transforms the way they practice medicine. That process is a quite simple process. It's one  two and three. First  they sit down and they say  let's identify the clinical problem among a certain set of patients. Let's say  for instance  let's try to help children who are bouncing in and out of the hospital with asthma. After identifying the problem  they  then move on to that second step  and they say  let's identify the root cause. Now  a root cause analysis  in healthcare  usually says  well  let's look at your genes  let's look at how you're behaving. Maybe you're not eating healthy enough. Eat healthier. It's a pretty simplistic approach to root cause analyses. It turns out  it doesn't really work when we just limit ourselves that worldview. The root cause analysis that an upstreamist brings to the table is to say  let's look at the living and the working conditions in your life. Perhaps  for children with asthma  it's what's happening in their home  or perhaps they live close to a freeway with major air pollution that triggers their asthma. And perhaps that's what we should mobilize our resources to address  because that third element  that third part of the process  is that next critical part of what upstreamists do. They mobilize the resources to create a solution  both within the clinical system  and then by bringing in people from public health  from other sectors  lawyers  whoever is willing to play ball  let's bring in to create a solution that makes sense  to take those patients who actually have clinical problems and address their root causes together by linking them to the resources you need. It's clear to me that there are so many stories of upstreamists who are doing remarkable things. The problem is that there's just not nearly enough of them out there. By some estimates  we need one upstreamist for every    to    clinicians in the healthcare system. In the U.S.  for instance  that would mean that we need        upstreamists by the year     . But we only have a few thousand upstreamists out there right now  by all accounts  and that's why  a few years ago  my colleagues and I said  you know what  we need to train and make more upstreamists. So we decided to start an organization called Health Begins  and Health Begins simply does that  We train upstreamists. And there are a lot of measures that we use for our success  but the main thing that we're interested in is making sure that we're changing the sense of confidence  that  don't ask  don't tell  metric among clinicians. We're trying to make sure that clinicians  and therefore their systems that they work in have the ability  the confidence to address the problems in the living and working conditions in our lives. We're seeing nearly a tripling of that confidence in our work. It's remarkable  but I'll tell you the most compelling part of what it means to be working with upstreamists to gather them together. What is most compelling is that every day  every week  I hear stories just like Veronica's. There are stories out there of Veronica and many more like her  people who are coming to the healthcare system and getting a glimpse of what it feels like to be part of something that works  a health care system that stops bouncing you back and forth but actually improves your health  listens to you who you are  addresses the context of your life  whether you're rich or poor or middle class. These stories are compelling because not only do they tell us that we're this close to getting the healthcare system that we want  but that there's something that we can all do to get there. Doctors and nurses can get better at asking about the context of patients' lives  not simply because it's better bedside manner  but frankly  because it's a better standard of care. Healthcare systems and payers can start to bring in public health agencies and departments and say  let's look at our data together. Let's see if we can discover some patterns in our data about our patients' lives and see if we can identify an upstream cause  and then  as importantly  can we align the resources to be able to address them  Medical schools  nursing schools  all sorts of health professional education programs can help by training the next generation of upstreamists. We can also make sure that these schools certify a backbone of the upstream approach  and that's the community health worker. We need many more of them in the healthcare system if we're truly going to have it be effective  to move from a sickcare system to a healthcare system. But finally  and perhaps most importantly  what do we do  What do we do as patients  We can start by simply going to our doctors and our nurses  to our clinics  and asking   Is there something in where I live and where I work that I should be aware of   Are there barriers to health that I'm just not aware of  and more importantly  if there are barriers that I'm surfacing  if I'm coming to you and I'm saying I think have a problem with my apartment or at my workplace or I don't have access to transportation  or there's a park that's way too far  so sorry doctor  I can't take your advice to go and jog  if those problems exist  then doctor  are you willing to listen  And what can we do together to improve my health where it begins  If we're all able to do this work  doctors and healthcare systems  payers  and all of us together  we'll realize something about health. Health is not just a personal responsibility or phenomenon. Health is a common good. It comes from our personal investment in knowing that our lives matter  the context of where we live and where we work  eat  and sleep  matter  and that what we do for ourselves  we also should do for those whose living and working conditions again  can be hard  if not harsh. We can all invest in making sure that we improve the allocation of resources upstream  but at the same time work together and show that we can move healthcare upstream. We can improve health where it begins. Thank you. So in       an English composer  technologist and astronomer called William Herschel noticed an object on the sky that didn't quite move the way the rest of the stars did. And Herschel's recognition that something was different  that something wasn't quite right  was the discovery of a planet  the planet Uranus  a name that has entertained countless generations of children  but a planet that overnight doubled the size of our known solar system. Just last month  NASA announced the discovery of     new planets in orbit around nearby stars  almost doubling overnight the number of planets we know about within our galaxy. So astronomy is constantly being transformed by this capacity to collect data  and with data almost doubling every year  within the next two decades  me may even reach the point for the first time in history where we've discovered the majority of the galaxies within the universe. But as we enter this era of big data  what we're beginning to find is there's a difference between more data being just better and more data being different  capable of changing the questions we want to ask  and this difference is not about how much data we collect  it's whether those data open new windows into our universe  whether they change the way we view the sky. So what is the next window into our universe  What is the next chapter for astronomy  Well  I'm going to show you some of the tools and the technologies that we're going to develop over the next decade  and how these technologies  together with the smart use of data  may once again transform astronomy by opening up a window into our universe  the window of time. Why time  Well  time is about origins  and it's about evolution. The origins of our solar system  how our solar system came into being  is it unusual or special in any way  About the evolution of our universe. Why our universe is continuing to expand  and what is this mysterious dark energy that drives that expansion  But first  I want to show you how technology is going to change the way we view the sky. So imagine if you were sitting in the mountains of northern Chile looking out to the west towards the Pacific Ocean a few hours before sunrise. This is the view of the night sky that you would see  and it's a beautiful view  with the Milky Way just peeking out over the horizon. but it's also a static view  and in many ways  this is the way we think of our universe  eternal and unchanging. But the universe is anything but static. It constantly changes on timescales of seconds to billions of years. Galaxies merge  they collide at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour. Stars are born  they die  they explode in these extravagant displays. In fact  if we could go back to our tranquil skies above Chile  and we allow time to move forward to see how the sky might change over the next year  the pulsations that you see are supernovae  the final remnants of a dying star exploding  brightening and then fading from view  each one of these supernovae five billion times the brightness of our sun  so we can see them to great distances but only for a short amount of time. Ten supernova per second explode somewhere in our universe. If we could hear it  it would be popping like a bag of popcorn. Now  if we fade out the supernovae  it's not just brightness that changes. Our sky is in constant motion. This swarm of objects you see streaming across the sky are asteroids as they orbit our sun  and it's these changes and the motion and it's the dynamics of the system that allow us to build our models for our universe  to predict its future and to explain its past. But the telescopes we've used over the last decade are not designed to capture the data at this scale. The Hubble Space Telescope  for the last    years it's been producing some of the most detailed views of our distant universe  but if you tried to use the Hubble to create an image of the sky  it would take    million individual images  about     years to do this just once. So this is driving us to new technologies and new telescopes  telescopes that can go faint to look at the distant universe but also telescopes that can go wide to capture the sky as rapidly as possible  telescopes like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope  or the LSST  possibly the most boring name ever for one of the most fascinating experiments in the history of astronomy  in fact proof  if you should need it  that you should never allow  a scientist or an engineer to name anything  not even your children.  Laughter  We're building the LSST. We expect it to start taking data by the end of this decade. I'm going to show you how we think it's going to transform  our views of the universe  because one image from the LSST is equivalent to       images from the Hubble Space Telescope  each image three and a half degrees on the sky  seven times the width of the full moon. Well  how do you capture an image at this scale  Well  you build the largest digital camera in history  using the same technology you find in the cameras in your cell phone or in the digital cameras you  can buy in the High Street  but now at a scale that is five and a half feet across  about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle  where one image is three billion pixels. So if you wanted to look at an image in its full resolution  just a single LSST image  it would take about        high definition TV screens. And this camera will image the sky  taking a new picture every    seconds  constantly scanning the sky so every three nights  we'll get a completely new view of the skies above Chile. Over the mission lifetime of this telescope  it will detect    billion stars and galaxies  and that will be for the first time we'll have detected more objects in our universe than people on the Earth. Now  we can talk about this in terms of terabytes and petabytes and billions of objects  but a way to get a sense of the amount of data that will come off this camera is that it's like playing every TED Talk ever recorded simultaneously     hours a day  seven days a week  for    years. And to process this data means searching through all of those talks for every new idea and every new concept  looking at each part of the video to see how one frame may have changed from the next. And this is changing the way that we do science  changing the way that we do astronomy  to a place where software and algorithms have to mine through this data  where the software is as critical to the science as the telescopes and the  cameras that we've built. Now  thousands of discoveries will come from this project  but I'm just going to tell you about two of the ideas about origins and evolution that may be transformed by our access to data at this scale. In the last five years  NASA has discovered over       planetary systems around nearby stars  but the systems we're finding aren't much like our own solar system  and one of the questions we face is is it just that we haven't been looking hard enough or is there something special or unusual about how our solar system formed  And if we want to answer that question  we have to know and understand the history of our solar system in detail  and it's the details that are crucial. So now  if we look back at the sky  at our asteroids that were streaming across the sky  these asteroids are like the debris of our solar system. The positions of the asteroids are like a fingerprint of an earlier time when the orbits of Neptune and Jupiter were much closer to the sun  and as these giant planets migrated through our solar system  they were scattering the asteroids in their wake. So studying the asteroids is like performing forensics  performing forensics on our solar system  but to do this  we need distance  and we get the distance from the motion  and we get the motion because of our access to time. So what does this tell us  Well  if you look at the little yellow asteroids flitting across the screen  these are the asteroids that are moving fastest  because they're closest to us  closest to Earth. These are the asteroids we may one day send spacecraft to  to mine them for minerals  but they're also the asteroids that may one day impact the Earth  like happened    million years ago with the extinction of the dinosaurs  or just at the beginning of the last century  when an asteroid wiped out almost       square miles of Siberian forest  or even just last year  as one burnt up over Russia  releasing the energy of a small nuclear bomb. So studying the forensics of our solar system doesn't just tell us about the past  it can also predict the future   including our future. Now when we get distance  we get to see the asteroids  in their natural habitat  in orbit around the sun. So every point in this visualization that you can see is a real asteroid. Its orbit has been calculated from its motion across the sky. The colors reflect the composition of these asteroids  dry and stony in the center  water rich and primitive towards the edge  water rich asteroids which may have seeded the oceans and the seas that we find on our planet when they bombarded the  Earth at an earlier time. Because the LSST will be able to go faint and not just wide  we will be able to see these asteroids far beyond the inner part of our solar system  to asteroids beyond the  orbits of Neptune and Mars  to comets and asteroids that may exist almost a light year from our sun. And as we increase the detail of this picture  increasing the detail by factors of    to      we will be able to answer questions such as  is there evidence for planets outside the orbit of Neptune  to find Earth impacting asteroids long before they're a danger  and to find out whether  maybe  our sun formed on its own or in a cluster of stars  and maybe it's this sun's stellar siblings that influenced the formation of our solar system  and maybe that's one of the reasons why  solar systems like ours seem to be so rare. Now  distance and changes in our universe   distance equates to time  as well as changes on the sky. Every foot of distance you look away  or every foot of distance an object is away  you're looking back about a billionth of a second in time  and this idea or this notion of looking back in time has revolutionized our ideas about the universe  not once but multiple times. The first time was in       when an astronomer called Edwin Hubble showed that the universe was expanding  leading to the ideas of the Big Bang. And the observations were simple  just    galaxies and a hand drawn picture. But just the idea that the more distant a galaxy  the faster it was receding  was enough to give rise to modern cosmology. A second revolution happened    years later  when two groups of astronomers showed that the universe wasn't just expanding  it was accelerating  a surprise like throwing up a ball into the sky and finding out the higher that it gets  the faster it moves away. And they showed this by measuring the brightness of supernovae  and how the brightness of the supernovae got fainter with distance. And these observations were more complex. They required new technologies and new telescopes  because the supernovae were in galaxies that were       times more distant than the ones used by Hubble. And it took three years to find just    supernovae  because a supernova only explodes once every hundred years within a galaxy. Three years to find    supernovae by searching through tens of thousands of galaxies. And once they'd collected their data  this is what they found. Now  this may not look impressive  but this is what a revolution in physics looks like  a line predicting the brightness of a supernova    billion light years away  and a handful of points that don't quite fit that line. Small changes give rise to big consequences. Small changes allow us to make discoveries  like the planet found by Herschel. Small changes turn our understanding of the universe on its head. So    supernovae  slightly too faint  meaning slightly further away  requiring that a universe must not just be expanding  but this expansion must be accelerating  revealing a component of our universe which we now call dark energy  a component that drives this expansion and makes up    percent of the energy budget of our universe today. So what is the next revolution likely to be  Well  what is dark energy and why does it exist  Each of these lines shows a different model for what dark energy might be  showing the properties of dark energy. They all are consistent with the    points  but the ideas behind these lines are dramatically different. Some people think about a dark energy that changes with time  or whether the properties of the dark energy are different depending on where you look on the sky. Others make differences and changes to the physics at the sub atomic level. Or  they look at large scales and change how gravity and general relativity work  or they say our universe is just one of many  part of this mysterious multiverse  but all of these ideas  all of these theories  amazing and admittedly some of them a little crazy  but all of them consistent with our    points. So how can we hope to make sense of this over the next decade  Well  imagine if I gave you a pair of dice  and I said you wanted to see whether those dice were loaded or fair. One roll of the dice would tell you very little  but the more times you rolled them  the more data you collected  the more confident you would become  not just whether they're loaded or fair  but by how much  and in what way. It took three years to find just    supernovae because the telescopes that we built could only survey a small part of the sky. With the LSST  we get a completely new view of the skies above Chile every three nights. In its first night of operation  it will find    times the number of supernovae used in the discovery of dark energy. This will increase by       within the first four months   .  million supernovae by the end of its survey  each supernova a roll of the dice  each supernova testing which theories of dark energy are consistent  and which ones are not. And so  by combining these supernova data with other measures of cosmology  we'll progressively rule out the different ideas and theories of dark energy until hopefully at the end of this survey around       we would expect to hopefully see a theory for our universe  a fundamental theory for the physics of our universe  to gradually emerge. Now  in many ways  the questions that I posed are in reality the simplest of questions. We may not know the answers  but we at least know how to ask the questions. But if looking through tens of thousands of galaxies revealed    supernovae that turned our understanding of the universe on its head  when we're working with billions of galaxies  how many more times are we going to find    points that don't quite match what we expect  Like the planet found by Herschel or dark energy or quantum mechanics or general relativity  all ideas that came because the data didn't quite match what we expected. What's so exciting about the next decade of data in astronomy is  we don't even know how many answers are out there waiting  answers about our origins and our evolution. How many answers are out there that we don't even know the questions that we want to ask  Thank you. Hi everybody. So my name is Mac. My job is that I lie to children  but they're honest lies. I write children's books  and there's a quote from Pablo Picasso   We all know that Art is not truth. Art is a lie that makes us realize truth or at least the truth that is  given us to understand. The artist must know the manner whereby to convince others of the  truthfulness of his lies.  I first heard this when I was a kid  and I loved it  but I had no idea what it meant. So I thought  you know what  it's what I'm here to talk to you today about  though  truth and lies  fiction and reality. So how could I untangle this knotted bunch of sentences  And I said  I've got PowerPoint. Let's do a Venn diagram.   Truth. Lies.    Laughter  So there it is  right there  boom. We've got truth and lies and then there's this little space  the edge  in the middle. That liminal space  that's art. All right. Venn diagram.  Laughter   Applause  But that's actually not very helpful either. The thing that made me understand that quote and really kind of what art  at least the art of fiction  was  was working with kids. I used to be a summer camp counselor. I would do it on my summers off from college  and I loved it. It was a sports summer camp for four  to six year olds. I was in charge of the four year olds  which is good  because four year olds can't play  sports  and neither can I. I play sports at a four year old level  so what would happen is the kids would dribble around some cones  and then got hot  and then they would go sit underneath the tree where I was already sitting    Laughter    and I would just make up stories and tell them to them and I would tell them stories about my life. I would tell them about how  on the weekends  I would go home and I would spy for the Queen of England. And soon  other kids who weren't even in my group of kids  they would come up to me  and they would say   You're Mac Barnett  right  You're the guy who spies for the Queen of England.  And I had been waiting my whole life for strangers to come up and ask me that question. In my fantasy  they were svelte Russian women  but  you know  four year olds   you take what you can get in Berkeley  California. And I realized that the stories that I was telling were real in this way that was familiar to me and really exciting. I think the pinnacle of this for  me   I'll never forget this   there was this little girl  named Riley. She was tiny  and she used to always take  out her lunch every day and she would throw out her fruit. She would just take her fruit  her mom packed her a melon every day  and she would just throw it in the ivy and then she would eat fruit snacks and pudding cups  and I was like   Riley  you can't do that  you  have to eat the fruit.  And she was like   Why   And I was like   Well  when you throw the fruit in the ivy  pretty soon  it's going to be overgrown with melons   which is why I think I ended up telling stories to children and not being a nutritionist for children. And so Riley was like   That will never happen. That's not going to happen.  And so  on the last day of camp  I got up early and I got a big cantaloupe from the grocery store and I hid it in the ivy  and then at lunchtime  I was like   Riley  why don't you go over there and see what you've done.  And    Laughter    she went trudging through  the ivy  and then her eyes just got so wide  and she pointed out this melon that was bigger than her head  and then all the kids ran over  there and rushed around her  and one of the kids was like   Hey  why is there a sticker on this   And I was like   That is also why I say do not throw your stickers in the ivy. Put them in the trash can. It ruins nature when you do this.  And Riley carried that melon around with her all day  and she was so proud. And Riley knew she didn't  grow a melon in seven days  but she also knew that she did  and it's a weird place  but it's not just a place that kids can get to. It's anything. Art can get us to that place. She was right in that place in the middle  that place which you could call art or fiction. I'm going to call it wonder. It's what Coleridge called the willing suspension of disbelief or poetic faith  for those moments where a story  no matter how strange  has some semblance of the truth  and then you're able to believe it. It's not just kids who can get there. Adults can too  and we get there when we read. It's why in two days  people will be descending on Dublin to take the walking tour of Bloomsday and see everything that happened in  Ulysses   even though none of that happened. Or people go to London and they visit Baker Street to see Sherlock Holmes' apartment  even though    B is just a number that was painted on a building that never  actually had that address. We know these characters aren't real  but we have real feelings about them  and we're able to do that. We know these characters aren't real  and yet we also know that they are. Kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can  and that's why I love writing for kids. I think kids are the best audience for serious literary fiction. When I was a kid  I was obsessed with secret door novels  things like  Narnia   where you would open a wardrobe and go through to a magical land. And I was convinced that secret doors really did exist and I would look for them and try to go through them. I wanted to live and cross over into  that fictional world  which is   I would always just open people's closet doors.   Laughter  I would just go through my mom's boyfriend's closet  and there was not a secret magical land there. There was some other weird stuff that I think my mom should know about. And I was happy to tell her all about it. After college  my first job was working behind one of these secret doors. This is a place called     Valencia. It's at     Valencia Street in the Mission in San Francisco  and when I worked there  there was a publishing company headquartered there called McSweeney's  a nonprofit writing center called     Valencia  but then the front of it was a strange shop. You see  this place was zoned retail  and in San Francisco  they were not going to give us a variance  and so the writer who founded it  a writer named Dave Eggers  to come into compliance  with code  he said   Fine  I'm just going to build a pirate supply store.  And that's what he did.  Laughter  And it's beautiful. It's all wood. There's drawers you can pull out and get citrus so you don't get scurvy. They have eyepatches in lots of colors  because when it's springtime  pirates want to go wild. You don't know. Black is boring. Pastel. Or eyes  also in lots of colors  just glass eyes  depending on how you want to deal with that situation. And the store  strangely  people came to them and bought things  and they ended up paying the rent for our tutoring center  which was behind it  but to me  more important was the fact that I think the quality of work you do  kids would come and get instruction in writing  and when you have to walk this weird  liminal  fictional space like this to go do your writing  it's going to affect the kind of work that you make. It's a secret door that you can walk through. So I ran the     in Los Angeles  and it was my job to build the store down there. So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart. That's our motto   Whenever you are  we're already then.  And it's on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Our friendly staff is ready to help you. They're from all eras  including just the     s  that guy on the end  he's from the very recent past. There's our Employees of the Month  including Genghis Khan  Charles Dickens. Some great people have come up through our ranks. This is our kind of pharmacy section. We have some patent medicines  Canopic jars for your organs  communist soap that says   This is your soap for the year.   Laughter  Our slushy machine broke on the opening night and  we didn't know what to do. Our architect was covered in red syrup. It looked like he had just murdered somebody  which it was not out of the question for this particular architect  and we didn't know what to do. It was going to be the highlight of our store. So we just put that sign on it that said   Out of order. Come back yesterday.   Laughter  And that ended up being a better joke than slushies  so we just left it there forever. Mammoth Chunks. These things weigh  like  seven pounds each. Barbarian repellent. It's full of salad and potpourri   things that barbarians hate. Dead languages. Leeches  nature's tiny doctors. And Viking Odorant  which comes in lots of great scents  toenails  sweat and rotten vegetables  pyre ash. Because we believe that Axe Body Spray is something that you should only find on the battlefield  not under your arms.  Laughter  And these are robot emotion chips  so robots can feel love or fear. Our biggest seller is Schadenfreude  which we did not expect. We did not think that was going to happen. But there's a nonprofit behind it  and kids go through a door that says  Employees Only  and they end up in this space where they do homework and write stories and make films and this is a book release party where kids will read. There's a quarterly that's published with just writing that's done by the kids who come every day after school  and we have release parties and they eat cake and read for their parents and drink milk out of champagne glasses. And it's a very special space  because it's this weird space in the front. The joke isn't a joke. You can't find the seams on the fiction  and I love that. It's this little bit of fiction that's colonized the real world. I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions. There's a term called metafiction  and that's just stories about stories  and meta's having a moment now. Its last big moment was probably in the     s with novelists like John Barth and William Gaddis  but it's been around. It's almost as old as storytelling itself. And one metafictive technique is breaking the fourth wall. Right  It's when an actor will turn to the audience and say   I am an actor  these are just rafters.  And even that supposedly honest moment  I would argue  is in service of the lie  but it's supposed to foreground the artificiality of the fiction. For me  I kind of prefer the opposite. If I'm going to break down the fourth wall  I want fiction to escape and come into the real world. I want a book to be a secret door that opens and lets the stories out into reality. And so I try to do this in my books. And here's just one example. This is the first book that I ever made. It's called  Billy Twitters and his Blue Whale Problem.  And it's about a kid who gets a blue whale as a pet but it's a punishment and it ruins his life. So it's delivered overnight by FedUp. And he has to take it to school with him. He lives in San Francisco   very tough city to own a blue whale in. A lot of hills  real estate is at a premium. This market's crazy  everybody. But underneath the jacket is this case  and that's the cover underneath the book  the jacket  and there's an ad that offers a free    day risk free trial for a blue whale. And you can just send in a self addressed stamped envelope and we'll send you a whale. And kids do write in. So here's a letter. It says   Dear people  I bet you    bucks you won't send me a blue whale. Eliot Gannon  age   .  So what Eliot and the other kids who send these in get back is a letter in very small print from a Norwegian law firm   that says that due to a change in customs laws  their whale has been held up in Sognefjord  which is a very lovely fjord  and then it just kind of talks about Sognefjord and Norwegian food for  a little while. It digresses. But it finishes off by saying that your whale would love to hear from you. He's got a phone number  and you can call and leave him a message. And when you call and leave him a message  you just  on the outgoing message  it's just whale sounds and then a beep  which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound. And they get a picture of their whale too. So this is Randolph  and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico who was one of the first kids to ever call in  and I'll play you some of Nico's message. This is the first message I ever got from Nico. I am your owner  Randolph. Hello. So this is the first time I can ever talk to you  and I might talk to you soon another day. Bye. Mac Barnett  So Nico called back  like  an hour later. And here's another one of Nico's messages. I haven't talked to you for a long time  but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday  yeah  Saturday or Sunday  so now I'm calling you again to say hello and I wonder what you're doing right now  and I'm going to probably call you again tomorrow or today  so I'll talk to you later. Bye. MB  So he did  he called back that day again. He's left over    messages for Randolph over four years. You find out all about him and the grandma that he loves and the grandma that  he likes a little bit less   and the crossword puzzles that he does  and this is   I'll play you one  more message from Nico. This is the Christmas message from Nico.  Beep   Audio  Nico  Hello  Randolph  sorry I haven't talked to you in a long time. It's just that I've been so busy because school started  as you might not know  probably  since you're a whale  you don't know  and I'm calling you to just say  to wish you a merry Christmas. So have a nice Christmas  and bye bye  Randolph. Goodbye. MB  I actually got Nico  I hadn't heard from in    months  and he just left a message two days ago. His voice is completely different  but he put his babysitter on the phone  and she was very nice to Randolph as well. But Nico's the best reader I could hope for. I would want anyone I was writing for to be in that place emotionally with the things that I create. I feel lucky. Kids like Nico are the best readers  and they deserve the best stories we can give them. Thank you very much. My grandfather was a cobbler. Back in the day  he made custom made shoes. I never got to meet him. He perished in the Holocaust. But I did inherit his love for making  except that it doesn't exist that much anymore. You see  while the Industrial Revolution did a great deal to improve humanity  it eradicated the very skill that my grandfather loved  and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it. But all of that is about to change with  D printing  and it all started with this  the very first part that was ever printed. It's a little older than TED. It was printed in      by Chuck Hull  who invented  D printing. But the thing that I want to talk to you about today  the big idea that I want to discuss with you  is not that  D printing is going to catapult us into the future  but rather that it's actually going to connect us with our heritage  and it's going to usher in a new era of localized  distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication. So think about useful things. You all know your shoe size. How many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples  Anybody  Wouldn't it be awesome if you could  for the first time  get eyewear that actually fits you perfectly and doesn't require any hinge assembly  so chances are  the hinges are not going to break  But the implications of  D printing go well beyond the tips of our noses. When I met Amanda for the first time  she could already stand up and walk a little bit even though she was paralyzed from the waist down  but she complained to me that her suit was uncomfortable. It was a beautiful robotic suit made by Ekso Bionics  but it wasn't inspired by her body. It wasn't made to measure. So she challenged me to make her something that was a little bit more feminine  a little bit more elegant  and lightweight  and like good tailors  we thought that we would measure her digitally. And we did. We built her an amazing suit. The incredible part about what I learned from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at  D printing and we say to ourselves  it's going to replace traditional methods. Amanda looked at it and she said  it's an opportunity for me to reclaim my symmetry and to embrace my authenticity. And you know what  She's not standing still. She now wants to walk in high heels. It doesn't stop there.  D printing is changing personalized medical devices as we know them  from new  beautiful  conformal  ventilated scoliosis braces to millions of dental restorations and to beautiful bracings for amputees  another opportunity to emotionally reconnect with your symmetry. And as we sit here today  you can go wireless on your braces with clear aligners  or your dental restorations. Millions of in the ear hearing aids are already  D printed today. Millions of people are served today from these devices. What about full knee replacements  from your data  made to measure  where all of the tools and guides are  D printed  G.E. is using  D printing to make the next generation LEAP engine that will save fuel to the tune of about    percent and cost for an airline of about    million dollars. Good for G.E.  right  And their customers and the environment. But  you know  the even better news is that this technology is no longer reserved for deep pocketed corporations. Planetary Resources  a startup for space explorations is going to put out its first  space probe later this year. It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship  it costs a fraction of its cost  and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts  and it's going to be out in space later this year. Google is taking on this very audacious project of making the block phone  the Ara. It's only possible because of the development of high speed  D printing that for the first time will make functional  usable modules that will go into it. A real moonshot  powered by  D printing. How about food  What if we could  for the first time  make incredible delectables like this beautiful TED Teddy here  that are edible  What if we could completely change the experience  like you see with that absinthe serving that is completely  D printed  And what if we could begin to put ingredients and colors and flavors in every taste  which means not only delicious foods but the promise of personalized nutrition around the corner  And that gets me to one of the biggest deals about  D printing. With  D printing  complexity is free. The printer doesn't care if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape  and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it. Many people think that  D printing will be the end of manufacturing as we know it. I think that it's the opportunity to put tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job opportunities  and with that  everybody can become an expert maker and an expert manufacturer. That will take new tools. Not everybody knows how to use CAD  so we're developing haptics  perceptual devices that will allow you to touch and feel your designs as if you play with digital clay. When you do things like that  and we also developed things that take physical photographs that are instantly printable  it will make it easier to create content  but with all of the unimagined  we will also have the unintended  like democratized counterfeiting and ubiquitous illegal possession. So many people ask me  will we have a  D printer in every home  I think it's the wrong question to ask. The right question to ask is  how will  D printing change my life  Or  in other words  what room in my house will  D printing fit in  So everything that you see here has been  D printed  including these shoes at the Amsterdam fashion show. Now  these are not my grandfather's shoes. These are shoes that represent the continuation of his passion for hyper local manufacturing. My grandfather didn't get to see Nike printing cleats for the recent Super Bowl  and my father didn't get to see me standing in my hybridized  D printed shoes. He passed away three years ago. But Chuck Hull  the man that invented it all  is right here in the house today  and thanks to him  I can say  thanks to his invention  I can say that I am a cobbler too  and by standing in these shoes I am honoring my past while manufacturing the future. Thank you. What do you guys think  For those who watched Sir Ken's memorable TED Talk  I am a typical example  of what he describes as  the body as a form of transport for the head   a university professor. You might think it was not fair that I've been lined up to speak after these first two talks to speak about science. I can't move my body to the beat  and after a scientist who became a philosopher  I have to talk about hard science. It could be a very dry subject. Yet  I feel honored. Never in my career  and it's been a long career  have I had the opportunity to start a talk feeling so inspired  like this one. Usually  talking about science is like exercising in a dry place. However  I've had the pleasure of being invited to come here to talk about water. The words  water  and  dry  do not match  right  It is even better to talk about water in the Amazon  which is the splendid cradle  of life. Fresh life. So this is what inspired me. That's why I'm here  although I'm carrying my head over here. I am trying  or will try to convey this inspiration. I hope this story will inspire you and that you'll spread the word. We know that there is controversy. The Amazon is the  lung of the world   because of its massive power to have vital gases exchanged between the forest and the atmosphere. We also hear about the storehouse of biodiversity. While many believe it  few know it. If you go out there  in this marsh  you'll be amazed at the    You can barely see the animals. The Indians say   The forest has more eyes than leaves.  That is true  and I will try to show you something. But today  I'm going to use a different approach  one that is inspired by these two initiatives here  a harmonic one and a philosophical one. I'll try to use an approach that's slightly materialistic  but it also attempts to convey that  in nature  there is extraordinary philosophy and harmony. There'll be no music in my presentation  but I hope you'll all notice the music of the reality I'm going to show you. I'm going to talk about physiology   not about lungs  but other analogies with human physiology  especially the heart. We'll start by thinking that water is like blood. The circulation in our body distributes fresh blood  which feeds  nurtures and supports us  and brings the used blood back to be renewed. In the Amazon  things happen similarly. We'll start by talking about the power of all these processes. This is an image of rain in motion. What you see there is the years passing in seconds. Rains all over the world. What do you see  The equatorial region  in general  and the Amazon specifically  is extremely important for the world's climate. It's a powerful engine. There is a frantic evaporation taking place here. If we take a look at this other image  which shows the water vapor flow  you have dry air in black  moist air in gray  and clouds in white. What you see there is an extraordinary resurgence in the Amazon. What phenomenon    if it's not a desert  what phenomenon makes water gush from the ground into the atmosphere with such power  that it can be seen from space  What phenomenon is this  It could be a geyser. A geyser is underground water heated by magma  exploding into the atmosphere and transferring this water  into the atmosphere. There are no geysers in the Amazon  unless I am wrong. I don't know of any. But we have something that plays the same role  with much more elegance though  the trees  our good old friends that  like geysers  can transfer an enormous amount of water from the ground into the atmosphere. There are     billion trees in the Amazon forest      billion geysers. That is done with an extraordinary sophistication. They don't need the heat of magma. They use sunlight to do this process. So  in a typical sunny day in the Amazon  a big tree manages to transfer       liters of water through its transpiration          liters. If we take all the Amazon  which is a very large area  and add it up to all that water that is released by transpiration  which is the sweat of the forest  we'll get to an incredible number     billion metric tons of water. In one day. Do you know how much that is  The Amazon River  the largest river on Earth  one fifth of all the fresh water that leaves the continents of the whole world and ends up in the oceans  dumps    billion metric tons of water a day in the Atlantic Ocean. This river of vapor that comes up from the forest and goes into the atmosphere is greater than the Amazon River. Just to give you an idea. If we could take a gigantic kettle  the kind you could plug into a power socket  an electric one  and put those    billion metric tons of water in it  how much power would you need to have this water evaporated  Any idea  A really big kettle. A gigantic kettle  right     thousand Itaipus. Itaipu is still the largest hydroelectric plant in the world. and Brazil is very proud of it because it provides more  than    percent of the power that is consumed in Brazil. And the Amazon is here  doing this for free. It's a vivid and extremely powerful plant  providing environmental services. Related to this subject  we are going to talk about what I call the paradox of chance  which is curious. If you look at the world map    it's easy to see this    you'll see that there are forests in the equatorial zone  and deserts are organized at    degrees north latitude     degrees south latitude  aligned. Look over there  in the southern hemisphere  the Atacama  Namibia and Kalahari in Africa  the Australian desert. In the northern hemisphere  the Sahara  Sonoran  etc. There is an exception  and it's curious  It's the quadrangle that ranges from Cuiab  to Buenos Aires  and from S o Paulo to the Andes. This quadrangle was supposed to be a desert. It's on the line of deserts. Why isn't it  That's why I call it the paradox of chance. What do we have in South America that is different  If we could use the analogy of the blood circulating in our bodies  like the water circulating in the landscape  we see that rivers are veins  they drain the landscape  they drain the tissue of nature. Where are the arteries  Any guess  What takes    How does water get to irrigate the tissues of nature and bring everything back through rivers  There is a new type of river  which originates in the blue sea  which flows through the green ocean    it not only flows  but it is also pumped by the green ocean    and then it falls on our land. All our economy  that quadrangle     percent of South America's  GDP comes from that area. It depends on this river. This river flows invisibly above us. We are floating here on this floating hotel  on one of the largest rivers on Earth  the Negro River. It's a bit dry and rough  but we are floating here  and there is this invisible river running above us. This river has a pulse. Here it is  pulsing. That's why we also talk about the heart. You can see the different seasons there. There's the rainy season. In the Amazon  we used to have two seasons  the humid season and the even more humid season. Now we have a dry season. You can see the river covering that region which  otherwise  would be a desert. And it is not. We  scientists    You see that I'm struggling here to move my head from one side to the other. Scientists study how it works  why  etc. and these studies are generating a series of discoveries  which are absolutely fabulous  to raise our awareness of the wealth  the complexity  and the wonder that we have  the symphony we have in this process. One of them is  How is rain formed  Above the Amazon  there is clean air  as there is clean air above the ocean. The blue sea has clean air above it and forms pretty few clouds  there's almost no rain there. The green ocean has the same clean air  but forms a lot of rain. What is happening here that is different  The forest emits smells  and these smells are condensation nuclei  which form drops in the atmosphere. Then  clouds are formed and there is torrential rain. The sprinkler of the Garden of Eden. This relation between a living thing  which is the forest  and a nonliving thing  which is the atmosphere  is ingenious in the Amazon  because the forest provides water and seeds  and the atmosphere forms the rain and gives water back  guaranteeing the forest's survival. There are other factors as well. We've talked a little about the heart  and let's now talk about another function  the liver  When humid air  high humidity and radiation are combined with these organic compounds  which I call exogenous vitamin C  generous vitamin C in the form of gas  the plants release antioxidants which react with pollutants. You can rest assured that you are breathing the purest air on Earth  here in the Amazon  because the plants take care of this characteristic as well. This benefits the very way plants work  which is another ingenious cycle. Speaking of fractals  and their relation with the way we work  we can establish other comparisons. As in the upper airways of our lungs  the air in the Amazon gets cleaned up from the excess of dust. The dust in the air that we breathe is cleaned by our airways. This keeps the excess of dust from affecting the rainfall. When there are fires in the Amazon  the smoke stops the rain   it stops raining  the forest dries up and catches fire. There is another fractal analogy. Like in the veins and arteries  the rain water is a feedback. It returns to the atmosphere. Like endocrinal glands and hormones  there are those gases which I told you about before  that are formed and released into the atmosphere  like hormones  which help in the formation of rain. Like the liver and the kidneys  as I've said  cleaning the air. And  finally  like the heart  pumping water from outside  from the sea  into the forest. We call it the biotic moisture pump  a new theory that is explained in a very simple way. If there is a desert in the continent with a nearby sea  evaporation's greater on the sea  and it sucks the air above the desert. The desert is trapped in this condition. It will always be dry. If you have the opposite situation  a forest  the evaporation  as we showed  is much greater  because of the trees  and this relation is reversed. The air above the sea is sucked into the continent and humidity is imported. This satellite image was taken one month ago   that's Manaus down there  we're down there   and it shows this process. It's not a common little river that flows into a canal. It's a mighty river that irrigates South America  among other things. This image shows those paths  all the hurricanes that have been recorded. You can see that  in the red square  there hardly are any hurricanes. That is no accident. This pump that sucks the moisture into the continent also speeds up the air above the sea  and this prevents hurricane formations. To close this part and sum up  I'd like to talk about something a little different. I have several colleagues who worked in the development of these theories. They think  and so do I  that we can save planet Earth. I'm not talking only about the Amazon. The Amazon teaches us a lesson on how pristine nature works. We didn't understand these processes before because the rest of the world is messed up. We could understand it here  though. These colleagues propose that  yes  we can save other areas  including deserts. If we could establish forests in those other areas  we can reverse climate change  including global warming. I have a dear colleague in India  whose name is Suprabha Seshan  and she has a motto. Her motto is   Gardening back the biosphere    Reajardinando a biosfera  in Portuguese. She does a wonderful job rebuilding ecosystems. We need to do this. Having closed this quick introduction  we see the reality that we have out here  which is drought  this climate change  things that we already knew. I'd like to tell you a short story. Once  about four years ago  I attended a declamation  of a text by Davi Kopenawa  a wise representative of the Yanomami people  and it went more or less like this   Doesn't the white man know that  if he destroys the forest  there will be no more rain  And that  if there's no more rain  there'll be nothing to drink  or to eat   I heard that  and my eyes welled up and I went   Oh  my  I've been studying this for    years  with a super computer  dozens  thousands of scientists  and we are starting to get to this conclusion  which he already knows   A critical point is the Yanomami have never deforested. How could they know the rain would end  This bugged me and I was befuddled. How could he know that  Some months later  I met him at another event and said   Davi  how did you know that if the forest was destroyed  there'd be no more rain   He replied   The spirit of the forest told us.  For me  this was a game changer  a radical change. I said   Gosh  Why am I doing all this science to get to a conclusion that he already knows   Then  something  absolutely critical hit me  which is  seeing is believing. Out of sight  out of mind. This is a need the previous speaker pointed out  We need to see things    I mean  we  Western society  which is becoming global  civilized    we need to see. If we don't see  we don't register the information. We live in ignorance. So  I propose the following    of course  the astronomer wouldn't like the idea    but let's turn the Hubble telescope upside down. And let's make it look down here  rather than to the far reaches of the universe. The universe is wonderful  but we have a practical reality  which is we live in an unknown cosmos  and we're ignorant about it. We're trampling on this wonderful cosmos that shelters us and houses us. Talk to any astrophysicist. The Earth is a statistical improbability. The stability and comfort that we enjoy  despite the droughts of the Negro River  and all the heat and cold and typhoons  etc.  there is nothing like it in the universe  that we know of. Then  let's turn Hubble in our direction  and let's look at the Earth. Let's start with the Amazon  Let's dive  let's reach out the reality we live in every day  and look carefully at it  since that's what we need. Davi Kopenawa doesn't need this. He has something already that I think I missed. I was educated by television. I think that I missed this  an ancestral record  a valuation of what I don't know  what I haven't seen. He is not a doubting Thomas. He believes   with veneration and reverence  in what his ancestors and the spirits taught him. We can't do it  so let's look into the forest. Even with Hubble up there    this is a bird's eye view  right  Even when this happens  we also see something that we don't know. The Spanish called it the green inferno. If you go out there into the bushes and get lost  and  let's say  if you head west  it's     kilometers to Colombia  and another       to somewhere else. So  you can figure out why they called it the green inferno. But go and look at what is in there. It is a live carpet. Each color you see is a tree species. Each tree  each tree top  has up to        species of insects in it  let alone the millions of species of fungi  bacteria  etc. All invisible. All of it is an even stranger cosmos to us than the galaxies billions of light years away from the Earth  which Hubble brings to our newspapers everyday. I'm going to end my talk here    I have a few seconds left    by showing you this wonderful being. When we see the morpho butterfly in the forest  we feel like someone's left open the door to heaven  and this creature escaped from there  because it's so beautiful. However  I cannot finish without showing you a tech side. We are tech arrogant. We deprive nature of its technology. A robotic hand is technological  mine is biological  and we don't think about it anymore. Let's then look at the morpho butterfly  an example of an invisible technological competence of life  which is at the very heart of our possibility of surviving on this planet  and let's zoom in on it. Again  Hubble is there. Let's get into the butterfly's wings. Scholars have tried to explain  Why is it blue  Let's zoom in on it. What you see is that the architecture of the invisible humiliates the best architects in the world. All of this on a tiny scale. Besides its beauty and functioning  there is another side to it. In nature  all that is organized in extraordinary structures has a function. This function of the morpho butterfly   it is not blue  it does not have blue pigments. It has photonic crystals on its surface  according to people who studied it  which are extremely  sophisticated crystals. Our technology had nothing like that at the time. Hitachi has now made a monitor that uses this technology  and it is used in optical fibers to transmit    Janine Benyus  who's been here several times  talks about it  biomimetics. My time's up. Then  I'll wrap it up with what is at the base of this capacity  of this competence of biodiversity  producing all these wonderful services  the living cell. It is a structure with a few microns  which is an internal wonder. There are TED Talks about it. I won't talk much longer  but each person in this room  including myself  has     trillion of these micromachines in their body  so that we can enjoy well being. Imagine what is out there in the Amazon forest      trillion. This is greater than the number of stars in the sky. And we are not aware of it. Thank you so much.  Applause  We are at a remarkable moment in time. We face over the next two decades two fundamental transformations that will determine whether the next     years is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries. Let me illustrate with an example. I first visited Beijing    years ago to teach at the People's University of China. China was getting serious about market economics and about university education  so they decided to call in the foreign experts. Like most other people  I moved around Beijing by bicycle. Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle  it was a safe and easy way to get around. Cycling in Beijing now is a completely different prospect. The roads are jammed by cars and trucks. The air is dangerously polluted from the burning of coal and diesel. When I was there last in the spring  there was an advisory for people of my age   over      to stay indoors and not move much. How did this come about  It came from the way in which Beijing has grown as a city. It's doubled over those    years  more than doubled  from    million to    million. It's become a sprawling urban area dependent on dirty fuel  dirty energy  particularly coal. China burns half the world's coal each year  and that's why  it is a key reason why  it is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. At the same time  we have to recognize that in that period China has grown remarkably. It has become the world's second largest economy. Hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. That's really important. But at the same time  the people of China are asking the question  What's the value of this growth if our cities are unlivable  They've analyzed  diagnosed that this is an unsustainable path of growth and development. China's planning to scale back coal. It's looking to build its cities in different ways. Now  the growth of China is part of a dramatic change  fundamental change  in the structure of the world economy. Just    years ago  the developing countries  the poorer countries of the world  were  notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people  they accounted for only about a third of the world's output. Now it's more than half     years from now  it will probably be two thirds from the countries that we saw    years ago as developing. That's a remarkable change. It means that most countries around the world  rich or poor  are going to be facing the two fundamental transformations that I want to talk about and highlight. Now  the first of these transformations is the basic structural change of the economies and societies that I've already begun to illustrate through the description of Beijing. Fifty percent now in urban areas. That's going to go to    percent in     . Over the next two decades  we'll see the demand for energy rise by    percent  and the growth in the economy and in the population is putting increasing pressure on our land  on our water and on our forests. This is profound structural change. If we manage it in a negligent or a shortsighted way  we will create waste  pollution  congestion  destruction of land and forests. If we think of those three areas that I have illustrated with my numbers   cities  energy  land   if we manage all that badly  then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods of the people around the world would be poor and damaged. And more than that  the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise  with immense risks to our climate. Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are already higher than they've been for millions of years. If we go on increasing those concentrations  we risk temperatures over the next century or so that we have not seen on this planet for tens of millions of years. We've been around as Homo sapiens   that's a rather generous definition  sapiens   for perhaps a quarter of a million years  a quarter of a million. We risk temperatures we haven't seen for tens of millions of years over a century. That would transform the relationship between human beings and the planet. It would lead to changing deserts  changing rivers  changing patterns of hurricanes  changing sea levels  hundreds of millions of people  perhaps billions of people who would have to move  and if we've learned anything from history  that means severe and extended conflict. And we couldn't just turn it off. You can't make a peace treaty with the planet. You can't negotiate with the laws of physics. You're in there. You're stuck. Those are the stakes we're playing for  and that's why we have to make this second transformation  the climate transformation  and move to a low carbon economy. Now  the first of these transformations is going to happen anyway. We have to decide whether to do it well or badly  the economic  or structural  transformation. But the second of the transformations  the climate transformations  we have to decide to do. Those two transformations face us in the next two decades. The next two decades are decisive for what we have to do. Now  the more I've thought about this  the two transformations coming together  the more I've come to realize that this is an enormous opportunity. It's an opportunity which we can use or it's an opportunity which we can lose. And let me explain through those three key areas that I've identified  cities  energy and land. And let me start with cities. I've already described the problems of Beijing  pollution  congestion  waste and so on. Surely we recognize that in many of our cities around the world. Now  with cities  like life but particularly cities  you have to think ahead. The cities that are going to be built   and there are many  and many big ones   we have to think of how to design them in a compact way so we can save travel time  and we can save energy. The cities that already are  there  well established  we have to think about renewal and investment in them so that we can connect ourselves much better within those cities  and make it easier  encourage more people  to live closer to the center. We've got examples building around the world of the kinds of ways in which we can do that. The bus rapid transport system in Bogot  in Colombia is a very important case of how to move around safely and quickly in a non polluting way in a city  very frequent buses  strongly protected routes  the same service  really  as an underground railway system  but much  much cheaper and can be done much more quickly  a brilliant idea in many more cities around the world that's developing. Now  some things in cities do take time. Some things in cities can happen much more quickly. Take my hometown  London. In       smog in London killed       people and badly damaged the lives of many  many more. And it happened all the time. For those of you live outside London in the U.K. will remember it used to be called The Smoke. That's the way London was. By regulating coal  within a few years the problems of smog were rapidly reduced. I remember the smogs well. When the visibility dropped to  less  than a few meters  they stopped the buses and I had to walk. This was the     s. I had to walk home three miles from school. Again  breathing was a hazardous activity. But it was changed. It was changed by a decision. Good decisions can bring good results  striking results  quickly. We've seen more  In London  we've introduced the congestion charge  actually quite quickly and effectively  and we've seen great improvements in the bus system  and cleaned up the bus system. You can see that the two transformations I've described  the structural and the climate  come very much together. But we have to invest. We have to invest in our cities  and we have to invest wisely  and if we do  we'll see cleaner cities  quieter cities  safer cities  more attractive cities  more productive cities  and stronger community in those cities   public transport  recycling  reusing  all sorts of things that bring communities together. We can do that  but we have to think  we have to invest  we have to plan. Let me turn to energy. Now  energy over the last    years has increased by about    percent. Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels. Over the next    years  perhaps it will increase by another    percent or so. We have to invest strongly in energy  we have to use it much more efficiently  and we have to make it clean. We can see how to do that. Take the example of California. It would be in the top    countries in the world if it was independent. I don't want to start any   California's a big place. In the next five or six years  they will likely move from around    percent in renewables   wind  solar and so on   to over    percent  and that would bring California back to greenhouse gas emissions in      to where they were in       a period when the economy in California would more or less have doubled. That's a striking achievement. It shows what can be done. Not just California   the  incoming government of India is planning to get solar technology to light up the homes of     million people who don't have electricity in India. They've set themselves a target of five years. I think they've got a good chance of doing that. We'll see  but what you're seeing now is people moving much more quickly. Four hundred million  more than the population of the United States. Those are the kinds of ambitions now people are setting themselves in terms of rapidity of change. Again  you can see good decisions can bring quick results  and those two transformations  the economy and the structure and the climate and the low carbon  are intimately intertwined. Do the first one well  the structural  the second one on the climate becomes much easier. Look at land  land and particularly forests. Forests are the hosts to valuable plant and animal species. They hold water in the soil and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere  fundamental to the tackling of climate change. But we're losing our forests. In the last decade  we've lost a forest area the size of Portugal  and much more has been degraded. But we're already seeing that we can do so much about that. We can recognize the problem  but we can also understand how to tackle it. In Brazil  the rate of deforestation has been reduced by    percent over the last    years. How  By involving local communities  investing in their agriculture and their economies  by monitoring more carefully  by enforcing the law more strictly. And it's not just stopping deforestation. That's of course of first and fundamental importance  but it's also regrading degraded land  regenerating  rehabilitating degraded land. I first went to Ethiopia in     . It was desperately poor. In the following years  it suffered devastating famines and profoundly destructive social conflict. Over the last few years  actually more than a few  Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly. It has ambitions to be a middle income country    years from now and to be carbon neutral. Again  I think it's a strong ambition but it is a plausible one. You're seeing that commitment there. You're seeing what can be done. Ethiopia is investing in clean energy. It's working in the rehabilitation of land. In Humbo  in southwest Ethiopia  a wonderful project to plant trees on degraded land and work with local communities on sustainable forest management has led to big increases in living standards. So we can see  from Beijing to London  from California to India  from Brazil to Ethiopia  we do understand how to manage those two transformations  the structural and the climate. We do understand how to manage those well. And technology is changing very rapidly. I don't have to list all those things to an audience like this  but you can see the electric cars  you can see the batteries using new materials. You can see that we can manage remotely now our household appliances on our mobile phones when we're away. You can see better insulation. And there's much more coming. But  and it's a big but  the world as a whole is moving far too slowly. We're not cutting emissions in the way we should. We're not managing those structural transformations as we can. The depth of understanding of the immense risks of climate change are not there yet. The depth of understanding of the attractiveness of what we can do is not there yet. We need political pressure to build. We need leaders to step up. We can have better growth  better climate  a better world. We can make  by managing those two transformations well  the next     years the best of centuries. If we make a mess of it  we  you and me  if we make a mess of it  if we don't manage those transformations properly  it will be  the next     years will be the worst of centuries. That's the major conclusion of the report on the economy and climate chaired by ex President Felipe Calder n of Mexico  and I co chaired that with him  and we handed that report yesterday here in New York  in the United Nations Building to the Secretary General of the U.N.  Ban Ki moon. We know that we can do this. Now  two weeks ago  I became a grandfather for the fourth time. Our daughter   Our daughter gave birth to Rosa here in New York two weeks ago. Here are Helen and Rosa. Two weeks old. Are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye and tell them that we understood the issues  that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities  and still we failed to act  Surely not. Let's make the next     years the best of centuries. America's favorite pie is  Audience  Apple. Kenneth Cukier  Apple. Of course it is. How do we know it  Because of data. You look at supermarket sales. You look at supermarket sales of    centimeter pies that are frozen  and apple wins  no contest. The majority of the sales are apple. But then supermarkets started selling smaller     centimeter pies  and suddenly  apple fell to fourth or fifth place. Why  What happened  Okay  think about it. When you buy a    centimeter pie  the whole family has to agree  and apple is everyone's second favorite. But when you buy an individual    centimeter pie  you can buy the one that you want. You can get your first choice. You have more data. You can see something that you couldn't see when you only had smaller amounts of it. Now  the point here is that more data doesn't just let us see more  more of the same thing we were looking at. More data allows us to see new. It allows us to see better. It allows us to see different. In this case  it allows us to see what America's favorite pie is  not apple. Now  you probably all have heard the term big data. In fact  you're probably sick of hearing the term big data. It is true that there is a lot of hype around the term  and that is very unfortunate  because big data is an extremely important tool by which society is going to advance. In the past  we used to look at small data and think about what it would mean to try to understand the world  and now we have a lot more of it  more than we ever could before. What we find is that when we have a large body of data  we can fundamentally do things that we couldn't do when we only had smaller amounts. Big data is important  and big data is new  and when you think about it  the only way this planet is going to deal with its global challenges   to feed people  supply them with medical care  supply them with energy  electricity  and to make sure they're not burnt to a crisp because of global warming   is because of the effective use of data. So what is new about big  data  What is the big deal  Well  to answer that question  let's think about what information looked like  physically looked like in the past. In       on the island of Crete  archaeologists discovered a clay disc. They dated it from      B.C.  so it's       years old. Now  there's inscriptions on this disc  but we actually don't know what it means. It's a complete mystery  but the point is that this is what information used to look like       years ago. This is how society stored and transmitted information. Now  society hasn't advanced all that much. We still store information on discs  but now we can store a lot more information  more than ever before. Searching it is easier. Copying it easier. Sharing it is easier. Processing it is easier. And what we can do is we can reuse this information for uses that we never even imagined when we first collected the data. In this respect  the data has gone from a stock to a flow  from something that is stationary and static to something that is fluid and dynamic. There is  if you will  a liquidity to information. The disc that was discovered off of Crete that's       years old  is heavy  it doesn't store a lot of information  and that information is unchangeable. By contrast  all of the files that Edward Snowden took from the National Security Agency in the United States fits on a memory stick the size of a fingernail  and it can be shared at the speed of light. More data. More. Now  one reason why we have so much data in the world today is we are collecting things that we've always collected information on  but another reason why is we're taking things that have always been informational but have never been rendered into a data format and we are putting it into data. Think  for example  the question of location. Take  for example  Martin Luther. If we wanted to know in the     s where Martin Luther was  we would have to follow him at all times  maybe with a feathery quill and an inkwell  and record it  but now think about what it looks like today. You know that somewhere  probably in a telecommunications carrier's database  there is a spreadsheet or at least a database entry that records your information of where you've been at all times. If you have a cell phone  and that cell phone has GPS  but even if it doesn't have GPS  it can record your information. In this respect  location has been datafied. Now think  for example  of the issue of posture  the way that you are all sitting right now  the way that you sit  the way that you sit  the way that you sit. It's all different  and it's a function of your leg length and your back and the contours of your back  and if I were to put sensors   maybe     sensors into all of your chairs right now  I could create an index that's fairly unique to you  sort of like a fingerprint  but it's not your finger. So what could we do with this  Researchers in Tokyo are using it as a potential anti theft device in cars. The idea is that the carjacker sits behind the wheel  tries to stream off  but the car recognizes that a non approved driver is behind the wheel  and maybe the engine just stops  unless you type in a password into the dashboard to say   Hey  I have authorization to drive.  Great. What if every single car in Europe had this technology in it  What could we do then  Maybe  if we aggregated the data  maybe we could identify telltale signs that best predict that a car accident is going to take place in the next five seconds. And then what we will have datafied is driver fatigue  and the service would be when the car senses that the person slumps into that position  automatically knows  hey  set an internal alarm that would vibrate the steering wheel  honk inside to say   Hey  wake up  pay more attention to the road.  These are the sorts of things we can do when we datafy more aspects of our lives. So what is the value of big data  Well  think about it. You have more information. You can do things that you couldn't do before. One of the most impressive areas where this concept is taking place is in the area of machine learning. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence  which itself is a branch of computer science. The general idea is that instead of instructing a computer what do do  we are going to simply throw data at the problem and tell the computer to figure it out for itself. And it will help you understand it by seeing its origins. In the     s  a computer scientist at IBM named Arthur Samuel liked to play checkers  so he wrote a computer program so he could play against the computer. He played. He won. He played. He won. He played. He won  because the computer only knew what a legal move was. Arthur Samuel knew something else. Arthur Samuel knew strategy. So he wrote a small sub program alongside it operating in the background  and all it did was score the probability that a given board configuration would likely lead to a winning board versus a losing board after every move. He plays the computer. He wins. He plays the computer. He wins. He plays the computer. He wins. And then Arthur Samuel leaves the computer to play itself. It plays itself. It collects more data. It collects more data. It increases the accuracy of its prediction. And then Arthur Samuel goes back to the computer and he plays it  and he loses  and he plays it  and he loses  and he plays it  and he loses  and Arthur Samuel has created a machine that surpasses his ability in a task that he taught it. And this idea of machine learning is going everywhere. How do you think we have self driving cars  Are we any better off as a society enshrining all the rules of the road into software  No. Memory is cheaper. No. Algorithms are faster. No. Processors are better. No. All of those things matter  but that's not why. It's because we changed the nature of the problem. We changed the nature of the problem from one in which we tried to overtly and explicitly explain to the computer how to drive to one in which we say   Here's a lot of data around the vehicle. You figure it out. You figure it out that that is a traffic light  that that traffic light is red and not green  that that means that you need to stop and not go forward.  Machine learning is at the basis of many of the things that we do online  search engines  Amazon's personalization algorithm  computer translation  voice recognition systems. Researchers recently have looked at the question of biopsies  cancerous biopsies  and they've asked the computer to identify by looking at the data and survival rates to determine whether cells are actually cancerous or not  and sure enough  when you throw the data at it  through a machine learning algorithm  the machine was able to identify the    telltale signs that best predict that this biopsy of the breast cancer cells are indeed cancerous. The problem  The medical literature only knew nine of them. Three of the traits were ones that people didn't need to look for  but that the machine spotted. Now  there are dark sides to big data as well. It will improve our lives  but there are problems that we need to be conscious of  and the first one is the idea that we may be punished for predictions  that the police may use big data for their purposes  a little bit like  Minority Report.  Now  it's a term called predictive policing  or algorithmic criminology  and the idea is that if we take a lot of data  for example where past crimes have been  we know where to send the patrols. That makes sense  but the problem  of course  is that it's not simply going to stop on location data  it's going to go down to the level of the individual. Why don't we use data about the person's high school transcript  Maybe we should use the fact that they're unemployed or not  their credit score  their web surfing behavior  whether they're up late at night. Their Fitbit  when it's able to identify biochemistries  will show that they have aggressive thoughts. We may have algorithms that are likely to predict what we are about to do  and we may be held accountable before we've actually acted. Privacy was the central challenge in a small data era. In the big data age  the challenge will be safeguarding free will  moral choice  human volition  human agency. There is another problem  Big data is going to steal our jobs. Big data and algorithms are going to challenge white collar  professional knowledge work in the   st century in the same way that factory automation and the assembly line challenged blue collar labor in the   th century. Think about a lab technician who is looking through a microscope at a cancer biopsy and determining whether it's cancerous or not. The person went to university. The person buys property. He or she votes. He or she is a stakeholder in society. And that person's job  as well as an entire fleet of professionals like that person  is going to find that their jobs are radically changed or actually completely eliminated. Now  we like to think that technology creates jobs over a period of time after a short  temporary period of dislocation  and that is true for the frame of reference with which we all live  the Industrial Revolution  because that's precisely what happened. But we forget something in that analysis  There are some categories of jobs that simply get eliminated and never come back. The Industrial Revolution wasn't very good if you were a horse. So we're going to need to be careful and take big data and adjust it for our needs  our very human needs. We have to be the master of this technology  not its servant. We are just at the outset of the big data era  and honestly  we are not very good at handling all the data that we can now collect. It's not just a problem for the National Security Agency. Businesses collect lots of data  and they misuse it too  and we need to get better at this  and this will take time. It's a little bit like the challenge that was faced by primitive man and fire. This is a tool  but this is a tool that  unless we're careful  will burn us. Big data is going to transform how we live  how we work and how we think. It is going to help us manage our careers and lead lives of satisfaction and hope and happiness and health  but in the past  we've often looked at information technology and our eyes have only seen the T  the technology  the hardware  because that's what was physical. We now need to recast our gaze at the I  the information  which is less apparent  but in some ways a lot more important. Humanity can finally learn from the information that it can collect  as part of our timeless quest to understand the world and our place in it  and that's why big data is a big deal. When I turned     I started my career as the first female photojournalist in the Gaza Strip  Palestine. My work as a woman photographer was considered a serious insult to local traditions  and created a lasting stigma for me and my family. The male dominated field made my presence unwelcome by all possible means. They made clear that a woman must not do a man's job. Photo agencies in Gaza refused to train me because of my gender. The  No  sign was pretty clear. Three of my colleagues went as far as to drive me to an open air strike area where the explosion sounds were the only thing I could hear. Dust was flying in the air  and the ground was shaking like a swing beneath me. I only realized we weren't there to document the event when the three of them got back into the armored Jeep and drove away  waving and laughing  leaving me behind in the open air strike zone. For a moment  I felt terrified  humiliated  and sorry for myself. My colleagues' action was not the only death threat I have received  but it was the most dangerous one. The perception of women's life in Gaza is passive. Until a recent time  a lot of  women were not allowed to work or pursue education. At times of such doubled war including both social restrictions on women and the Israeli Palestinian conflict  women's dark and bright stories were fading away. To men  women's stories were seen as inconsequential. I started paying closer attention to women's lives in Gaza. Because of my gender  I had access to worlds where my colleagues were forbidden. Beyond the obvious pain and struggle  there was a healthy dose of laughter and accomplishments. In front of a police compound in Gaza City during the first war in Gaza  an Israeli air raid managed to destroy the compound and break my nose. For a moment  all I saw was white  bright white  like these lights. I thought to myself I either got blind or I was in heaven. By the time I managed to open my eyes  I had documented this moment. Mohammed Khader  a Palestinian worker who spent two decades in Israel  as his retirement plan  he decided to build a four floor house  only by the first field operation at his neighborhood  the house was flattened to the ground. Nothing was left but the pigeons he raised and a jacuzzi  a bathtub that he got from Tel Aviv. Mohammed got the bathtub on the top of the rubble and started giving his kids an every morning bubble bath. My work is not meant to hide the scars of war  but to show the full frame of unseen stories of Gazans. As a Palestinian female photographer  the journey of struggle  survival and everyday life has inspired me to overcome the community taboo and see a different side of war and its aftermath. I became a witness with a choice  to run away or stand still. Thank you. I've been a critical care EMT for the past seven years in Suffolk County  New York. I've been a first responder in a number of incidents ranging from car accidents to Hurricane Sandy. If you are like most people  death might be one of your greatest fears. Some of us will see it coming. Some of us won't. There is a little known documented medical term called impending doom. It's almost a symptom. As a medical provider  I'm trained to respond to this symptom like any other  so when a patient having a heart attack looks at me and says   I'm going to die today   we are trained to reevaluate the patient's condition. Throughout my career  I have responded to a number of incidents where the patient had minutes left to live and there was nothing I could do for them. With this  I was faced with a dilemma  Do I tell the dying that they are about to face death  or do I lie to them to comfort them  Early in my career  I faced this dilemma by simply lying. I was afraid. I was afraid if I told them the truth  that they would die in terror  in fear  just grasping for those last moments of life. That all changed with one incident. Five years ago  I responded to a motorcycle accident. The rider had suffered critical  critical injuries. As I assessed him  I realized that there was nothing that could be done for him  and like so many other cases  he looked me in the eye and asked that question   Am I going to die   In that moment  I decided to do something different. I decided to tell him the truth. I decided to tell him that he was going to die and that there was nothing I could do for him. His reaction shocked me to this day. He simply laid back and had a look of acceptance on his face. He was not met with that terror or fear that I thought he would be. He simply laid there  and as I looked into his eyes  I saw inner peace and acceptance. From that moment forward  I decided it was not my place to comfort the dying with my lies. Having responded to many cases since then where patients were in their last moments and there was nothing I could do for them  in almost every case  they have all had the same reaction to the truth  of inner peace and acceptance. In fact  there are three patterns I have observed in all these cases. The first pattern always kind of shocked me. Regardless of religious belief or cultural background  there's a need for forgiveness. Whether they call it sin or they simply say they have a regret  their guilt is universal. I had once cared for an elderly gentleman who was having a massive heart attack. As I prepared myself and my equipment for his imminent cardiac arrest  I began to tell the patient of his imminent demise. He already knew by my tone of voice and body language. As I placed the defibrillator pads on his chest  prepping for what was going to happen  he looked me in the eye and said   I wish I had spent more time with my children and grandchildren instead of being selfish with my time.  Faced with imminent death  all he wanted was forgiveness. The second pattern I observe is the need for remembrance. Whether it was to be remembered in my thoughts or their loved ones'  they needed to feel that they would be living on. There's a need for immortality within the hearts and thoughts of their loved ones  myself  my crew  or anyone around. Countless times  I have had a  patient look me in the eyes and say   Will you remember me   The final pattern I observe always touched me the deepest  to the soul. The dying need to know that their life had meaning. They need to know that they did not waste their life on meaningless tasks. This came to me very  very early in my career. I had responded to a call. There was a female in her late   s severely pinned within a vehicle. She had been t boned at a high rate of speed  critical  critical condition. As the fire department worked to remove her from the car  I climbed in to begin to render care. As we talked  she had said to me   There was so much more I wanted to do with my life.  She had felt she had not left her mark on this Earth. As we talked further  it would turn out that she was a mother of two adopted children who were both on their way to medical school. Because of her  two children had a chance they never would have had otherwise and would go on to save lives in the medical field as medical doctors. It would end up taking    minutes to free her from the vehicle. However  she perished prior to freeing her. I believed what you saw in the movies  when you're in those last moments that it's strictly terror  fear. I have come to realize  regardless of the circumstance  it's generally met with peace and acceptance  that it's the littlest things  the littlest moments  the littlest things you brought into the world that give you peace in those final moments. Thank you. When  in       still a student  I got a traveling fellowship to study housing in North America. We traveled the country. We saw public housing high rise buildings in all major cities  New York  Philadelphia. Those who have no choice lived there. And then we traveled from suburb to suburb  and I came back thinking  we've got to reinvent the apartment building. There has to be another way of doing this. We can't sustain suburbs  so let's design a building which gives the qualities of a house to each unit. Habitat would be all about gardens  contact with nature  streets instead of corridors. We prefabricated it so we would achieve economy  and there it is almost    years later. It's a very desirable place to live in. It's now a heritage building  but it did not proliferate. In       I made my first trip to China. It was the Cultural Revolution. We traveled the country  met with architects and planners. This is Beijing then  not a single high rise building in Beijing or Shanghai. Shenzhen didn't even exist as a city. There were hardly any cars. Thirty years later  this is Beijing today. This is Hong Kong. If you're wealthy  you live there  if you're poor  you live there  but high density it is  and it's not just Asia. S o Paulo  you can travel in a helicopter    minutes seeing those high rise buildings consume the   th century low rise environment. And with it  comes congestion  and we lose mobility  and so on and so forth. So a few years ago  we decided to go back and rethink Habitat. Could we make it more affordable  Could we actually achieve this quality of life in the densities that are prevailing today  And we realized  it's basically about light  it's about sun  it's about nature  it's about fractalization. Can we open up the surface of the building so that it has more contact with the exterior  We came up with a number of models  economy models  cheaper to build and more compact  membranes of housing where people could design their own house and create their own gardens. And then we decided to take New York as a test case  and we looked at Lower Manhattan. And we mapped all the building area in Manhattan. On the left is Manhattan today  blue for housing  red for office buildings  retail. On the right  we reconfigured it  the office buildings form the base  and then rising    stories above  are apartments. There's a street in the air on the   th level  a community street. It's permeable. There are gardens and open spaces for the community  almost every unit with its own private garden  and community space all around. And most important  permeable  open. It does not form a wall or an obstruction in the city  and light permeates everywhere. And in the last two or three years  we've actually been  for the first time  realizing the quality of life of Habitat in real life projects across Asia. This in Qinhuangdao in China  middle income housing  where there is a bylaw that every apartment must receive three hours of sunlight. That's measured in the winter solstice. And under construction in Singapore  again middle income housing  gardens  community streets and parks and so on and so forth. And Colombo. And I want to touch on one more issue  which is the design of the public realm. A hundred years after we've begun building with tall buildings  we are yet to understand how the tall high rise building becomes a building block in making a city  in creating the public realm. In Singapore  we had an opportunity     million square feet  extremely high density. Taking the concept of outdoor and indoor  promenades and parks integrated with intense urban life. So they are outdoor spaces and indoor spaces  and you move from one to the other  and there is contact with nature  and most relevantly  at every level of the structure  public gardens and open space  on the roof of the podium  climbing up the towers  and finally on the roof  the sky park  two and a half acres  jogging paths  restaurants  and the world's longest swimming pool. And that's all I can tell you in five minutes. Thank you. I am an engineering professor  and for the past    years I've been teaching crap. Not that I'm a bad teacher  but I've been studying and teaching about human waste and how waste is conveyed through these wastewater treatment plants  and how we engineer and design these treatment plants so that we can protect surface water like rivers. I've based my scientific career on using leading edge molecular techniques  DNA  and RNA based methods to look at microbial populations in biological reactors  and again to optimize these systems. And over the years  I have developed an unhealthy obsession with toilets  and I've been known to sneak into toilets and take my camera phone all over the world. But along the way  I've learned that it's not just the technical side  but there's also this thing called the culture of crap. So for example  how many of you are washers and how many of you are wipers  If  well  I guess you know what I mean. If you're a washer  then you use water for anal cleansing. That's the technical term. And if you're a wiper  then you use toilet paper or  in some regions of the world where it's not available  newspaper or rags or corncobs. And this is not just a piece of trivia  but it's really important to understand and solve the sanitation problem. And it is a big problem  There are  .  billion people in the world who don't have access to adequate sanitation. For them  there's no modern toilet. And there are  .  billion people whose toilets are the streets or river banks or open spaces  and again  the technical term for that is open defecation  but that is really simply shitting in the open. And if you're living in fecal material and it's surrounding you  you're going to get sick. It's going to get into your drinking water  into your food  into your immediate surroundings. So the United Nations estimates that every year  there are   .  million child deaths because of inadequate sanitation. That's one preventable death every    seconds      every hour        every day. And so  to avoid open defecation  municipalities and cities build infrastructure  for example  like pit latrines  in peri urban and rural areas. For example  in KwaZulu Natal  province in South Africa  they've built tens of thousands of these pit latrines. But there's a problem when you scale up to tens of thousands  and the problem is  what happens when the pits are full  This is what happens. People defecate around the toilet. In schools  children defecate on the floors and then leave a trail outside the building and start defecating around the building  and these pits have to be cleaned and manually emptied. And who does the emptying  You've got these workers who have to sometimes go down into the pits and manually remove the contents. It's a dirty and dangerous business. As you can see  there's no protective equipment  no protective clothing. There's one worker down there. I hope you can see him. He's got a face mask on  but no shirt. And in some countries  like India  the lower castes are condemned to empty the pits  and they're further condemned by society. So you ask yourself  how can we solve this and why don't we just build Western style flush toilets for these two and a half billion  And the answer is  it's just not possible. In some of these areas  there's not enough water  there's no energy  it's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars to lay out the sewer lines and to build the facilities and to operate and maintain these systems  and if you don't build it right  you're going to have flush toilets that basically go straight into the river  just like what's happening in many cities in the developing world. And is this really the solution  Because essentially  what you're doing is you're using clean water and you're using it to flush your toilet  convey it to a wastewater treatment plant which then discharges to a river  and that river  again  is a drinking water source. So we've got to rethink sanitation  and we've got to reinvent the sanitation infrastructure  and I'm going to argue that to do this  you have to employ systems thinking. We have to look at the whole sanitation chain. We start with a human interface  and then we have to think about how feces are collected and stored  transported  treated and reused   and not just disposal but reuse. So let's start with the human user interface. I say  it doesn't matter if you're a washer or a wiper  a sitter or a squatter  the human user interface should be clean and easy to use  because after all  taking a dump should be pleasurable. And when we open the possibilities to understanding this sanitation chain  then the back end technology  the collection to the reuse  should not really matter  and then we can apply locally adoptable and context sensitive solutions. So we can open ourselves to possibilities like  for example  this urine diverting toilet  and there's two holes in this toilet. There's the front and the back  and the front collects the urine  and the back collects the fecal material. And so what you're doing is you're separating the urine  which has    percent of the nitrogen and    percent of the phosphorus  and then that can then be treated and precipitated to form things like struvite  which is a high value fertilizer  and then the fecal material can then be disinfected and again converted to high value end products. Or  for example  in some of our research  you can reuse the water by treating it in on site sanitation systems like planter boxes or constructed wetlands. So we can open up all these possibilities if we take away the old paradigm of flush toilets and treatment plants. So you might be asking  who's going to pay  Well  I'm going to argue that governments should fund sanitation infrastructure. NGOs and donor organizations  they can do their best  but it's not going to be enough. Governments should fund sanitation the same way they fund roads and schools and hospitals and other infrastructure like bridges  because we know  and the WHO has done this study  that for every dollar that we invest in sanitation infrastructure  we get something like three to    dollars back. Let's go back to the problem of pit emptying. So at North Carolina State University  we challenged our students to come up with a simple solution  and this is what they came up with  a simple  modified screw auger that can move the waste up from the pit and into a collecting drum  and now the pit worker doesn't have to go down into the pit. We tested it in South Africa  and it works. We need to make it more robust  and we're going to do more testing in Malawi and South Africa this coming year. And our idea is to make this a professionalized pit emptying service so that we can create a small business out of it  create profits and jobs  and the hope is that  as we are rethinking sanitation  we are extending the life of these pits so that we don't have to resort to quick solutions that don't really make sense. I believe that access to adequate sanitation is a basic human right. We need to stop the practice of lower castes and lower status people going down and being condemned to empty pits. It is our moral  it is our social and our environmental obligation. Thank you. Women represent    percent of middle management and professional positions  but the percentages of women at the top of organizations represent not even a third of that number. So some people hear that statistic and they ask  why do we have so few women leaders  But I look at that statistic and  if you  like me  believe that leadership manifests at every level  you would see that there's a tremendous  awesome resource of leaders who are leading in middle management  which raises a different question  Why are there so many women mired in the middle and what has to happen to take them to the top  So some of you might be some of those women who are in middle management and seeking to move up in your organization. Well  Tonya is a great example of one of these women. I met her two years ago. She was a vice president in a Fortune    company  and she said to me with a sense of deep frustration   I've worked really hard to improve my confidence and my assertiveness and develop a great brand  I get terrific performance evals from my boss  my    s in the organization let me know that my teams love working for me  I've taken every management course that I can here  I am working with a terrific mentor  and yet I've been passed over twice for advancement opportunities  even when my manager knows that I'm committed to moving up and even interested in an international assignment. I don't understand why I'm being passed over.  So what Tonya doesn't realize is that there's a missing    percent of the career success equation for women  and it's understanding what this missing    percent is that's required to close the gender gap at the top. In order to move up in organizations  you have to be known for your leadership skills  and this would apply to any of you  women or men. It means that you have to be recognized for using the greatness in you to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes by engaging the greatness in others. Put in other language  it means you have to use your skills and talents and abilities to help the organization achieve its strategic financial goals and do that by working effectively with others inside of the organization and outside. And although all three of these elements of leadership are important  when it comes to moving up in organizations  they aren't equally important. So pay attention to the green box as I move forward. In seeking and identifying employees with high potential  the potential to go to the top of organizations  the skills and competencies that relate to that green box are rated twice as heavily as those in the other two elements of leadership. These skills and competencies can be summarized as business  strategic  and financial acumen. In other words  this skill set has to do with understanding where the organization is going  what its strategy is  what financial targets it has in place  and understanding your role in moving the organization forward. This is that missing    percent of the career success equation for women  not because it's missing in our capabilities or abilities  but because it's missing in the advice that we're given. Here's what I mean by that. Five years ago  I was asked to moderate a panel of executives  and the topic for the evening was  What do you look for in  high potential employees   So think about the three elements of leadership as I summarize for you what they told me. They said   We look for people who are smart and hard working and committed and trustworthy and resilient.  So which element of leadership does that relate to  Personal greatness. They said   We look for employees who are great with our customers  who empower their teams  who negotiate effectively  who are able to manage conflict well  and are overall great communicators.  Which element of leadership does that equate to  Engaging the greatness in others. And then they pretty much stopped. So I asked   Well  what about people who understand your business  where it's going  and their role in taking it there  And what about people who are able to scan the external environment  identify risks and opportunities  make strategy or make strategic recommendations  And what about people who are able to look at the financials of your business  understand the story that the financials tell  and either take appropriate action or make appropriate recommendations   And to a man  they said   That's a given.  So I turned to the audience of     women and I asked   How many of you have ever been told that the door opener for career advancement is your business  strategic and financial acumen  and that all the other important stuff is what differentiates you in the talent pool   Three women raised their hand  and I've asked this question of women all around the globe in the five years since  and the percentage is never much different. So this is obvious  right  But how can it be  Well  there are primarily three reasons that there's this missing    percent in the career success advice given to women  When organizations direct women toward resources that focus on the conventional advice that we've been hearing for over    years  there's a notable absence of advice that relates to business  strategic and financial acumen. Much of the advice is emphasizing personal actions that we need to take  like become more assertive  become more confident  develop your personal brand  things that Tonya's been working on  and advice about working with other people  things like learn to self promote  get a mentor  enhance your network  and virtually nothing said about the importance of business  strategic and financial acumen. This doesn't mean that this advice is unimportant. What it means is that this is advice that's absolutely essential for breaking through from career start to middle management  but it's not the advice that gets women to break through from the middle  where we're    percent  to senior and executive positions. And this is why conventional advice to women in    years hasn't closed the gender gap at the top and won't close it. Now  the second reason relates to Tonya's comments about having had excellent performance evals  great feedback from her teams  and having taken every management training program she can lay her hands on. So you would think that she's getting messages from her organization through the talent development systems and performance management systems that let her know how important it is to develop business  strategic and financial acumen  but here again  that green square is quite small. On average  talent and performance management systems in the organizations that I've worked with focus three to one on the other two elements of leadership compared to the importance of business  strategic and financial acumen  which is why typical talent and performance systems haven't closed and won't close the gender gap at the top. Now  Tonya also talked about working with a mentor  and this is really important to talk about  because if organizations  talent and performance systems aren't giving people in general information about the importance of business  strategic and financial acumen  how are men getting to the top  Well  there are primarily two ways. One is because of the positions they're guided into  and the other is because of informal mentoring and sponsorship. So what's women's experience as it relates to mentoring  Well  this comment from an executive that I worked with recently illustrates that experience. He was very proud of the fact that last year  he had two prot g s  a man and a woman. And he said   I helped the woman build confidence  I helped the man learn the business  and I didn't realize that I was treating them any differently.  And he was sincere about that. So what this illustrates is that as managers  whether we're women or men  we have mindsets about women and men  about careers in leadership  and these unexamined mindsets won't close the gender gap at the top. So how do we take this idea of the missing    percent and turn it into action  Well  for women  the answer is obvious  we have to begin to focus more on developing and demonstrating the skills we have that show that we're people who understand our businesses  where they're headed  and our role in taking it there. That's what enables that breakthrough from middle management to leadership at the top. But you don't have to be a middle manager to do this. One young scientist that works in a biotech firm used her insight about the missing    percent to weave financial impact data into a project update she did and got tremendous positive feedback from the managers in the room. So we don't want to put     percent of the responsibility on women's shoulders  nor would it be wise to do so  and here's why  In order for companies to achieve their strategic financial goals  executives understand that they have to have everyone pulling in the same direction. In other words  the term we use in business is  we have to have strategic alignment. And executives know this very well  and yet only    percent  according to a recent Conference Board report  believe that they have that strategic alignment in place. So for    percent of organizations  achieving their strategic financial goals is questionable. And if you think about what I've just shared  that you have situations where at least    percent of your middle managers haven't received clear messaging that they have to become focused on the business  where it's headed  and their role in taking it there  it's not surprising that that percentage of executives who are confident about alignment is so low  which is why there are other people who have a role to play in this. It's important for directors on boards to expect from their executives proportional pools of women when they sit down once a year for their succession discussions. Why  Because if they aren't seeing that  it could be a red flag that their organization isn't as aligned as it could potentially be. It's important for CEOs to also expect these proportional pools  and if they hear comments like   Well  she doesn't have enough business experience   ask the question   What are we going to do about that   It's important for H.R. executives to make sure that the missing    percent is appropriately emphasized  and it's important for women and men who are in management positions to examine the mindsets we hold about women and men  about careers and success  to make sure we are creating a level playing field for everybody. So let me close with the latest chapter in Tonya's story. Tonya emailed me two months ago  and she said that she had been interviewed for a new position  and during the interview  they probed about her business acumen and her strategic insights into the industry  and she said that she was so happy to report that now she has a new position reporting directly to the  chief information officer at her company. So for some of you  the missing    percent is an idea for you to put into action  and I hope that for all of you  you will see it as an idea worth spreading in order to help organizations be more effective  to help women create careers that soar  and to help close the gender gap at the top. Thank you.
