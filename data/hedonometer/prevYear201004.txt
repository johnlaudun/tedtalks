I started with paragliding. Paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider  with the possibility to fly cross country  distance  just with the use of thermals to soar. Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider. From there I started with skydiving. In this picture you can see there is a four way skydive  four people flying together  and on the left hand side it's the camera flier with the camera mounted to his helmet so he can film the whole jump  for the film itself and also for the judging. From regular  relative skydiving I went on to freeflying. Freeflying is more the three dimensional skydiving. You can see the skydiver with the red suit  he's in a stand up position. The one with the yellow green suit  he's flying head down. And that's me in the background  carving around the whole formation in freefall also  with the helmet cam to film this jump. From freeflying I went on to skysurfing. Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet. You can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board  there is a lot of force  a lot of power. Of course I can use this power for example for nice spinning    we call it  helicopter moves.  From there I went on to wingsuit flying. Wingsuit flying is a suit  that I can make fly  just only with my body. If I put some tension on my body  tension on my suit  I can make it fly. And as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the bigger surface. With a proper body position I'm able to really move forward to gain quite some distance. This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro. You can see the Copacabana on the left hand side. From there with all the skills and knowledge from paragliding and all the different disciplines in skydiving  I went on to BASE jumping. BASE jumping is skydiving from fixed objects  like buildings  antennae  bridges and earth    meaning mountains  cliffs. It's for sure    for me    it's the ultimate feeling of being in free fall  with all the visual references. So my goal soon was to discover new places that nobody had jumped before. So in summer      I was the first to BASE jump the Eiger North Face in Switzerland. Two years after this  I was the first to BASE jump from Matterhorn  a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here.      I did a BASE jump from the Eiger  from the Monk and from the Jungfrau  three very famous mountains in Switzerland. The special thing on these three jumps were  I hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day. In      I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris. So with all this knowledge  I also wanted to get into stunts. So with some friends we started to do different tricks  like for example this jump here  I jumped from a paraglider. Or here    everybody was freezing  pretty much  except me  because it was very cold in Austria where we did this filming. Everybody sitting in a basket  and I was on top of the balloon  ready to slide down with my skysurf board. Or this jump  from a moving truck on the highway. Extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step  if you really work hard on your skills and on your knowledge. Of course you need to be in physical  very good  condition  so I'm training a lot. You need to have the best possible equipment. And probably the most important is you have to work on your mental skills  mental preparation. And all this to come as close as possible to the human dream of being able to fly. So for       I'm training hard for my two new projects. The first one  I want to set a world record in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit. And I want to set a new record  with the longest distance ever flown. For my second project  I have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before. So now  on the following movie you will see that I'm much better in flying a wingsuit than speaking in English. Enjoy  and thank you very much. June Cohen  I have some questions. I think we all might have some questions. Question one  so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does  Because it looks like it might. Ueli Gegenschatz  Pretty much. I believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly. JC  I know the answer to this  but how do you land  UE  Parachute. We have to open a parachute just seconds before  I would say  impact. It's not possible to land a wingsuit yet. JC  Yet. But people are trying. Are you among those    you're not going to commit    are you among those trying to do it  UE  It's a dream. It's a dream. Yeah. We're still working on it and we're developing the wingsuits to get better performance  to get more knowledge. And I believe soon. JC  All right. Well we will watch this space. But I have two more questions. What is the    there was exhaust coming out of the back of the wingsuit. Was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing  UE  Nope. It's just smoke. JC  Coming off of you  UE  Hopefully not. JC  That seems dangerous. UE  No  smoke is for two reasons  you can see the speed  you can see the way where I was flying. That's reason number one. And reason number two  it's much easier for the camera guy to film If I'm using smoke. JC  Ah  I see. So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked. One more question. What do you do to to cover your face  Because I just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards. Are you in a helmet  Are you in goggles  UE  The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles. JC  And is that how you usually fly  UE  Usually I'm wearing a helmet. In the mountains I'm always wearing a helmet because of landings    usually it's difficult    it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings. So you have to be prepared. JC  Right. Now is there anything you don't do  Do people come to you with projects and say   We want you to do this   and do you ever say   No  no I'm not going to.  UE  Oh of course  of course. Some people have crazy ideas and    JC  ...a round of applause... UE  Thank you very much. I was asked by Wilsonart International  a plastic laminate company  which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world    they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York  in     . So looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design  interiors and furniture  we came up with the solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it  and trying to portray laminate  and a trailer  in kind of a fresh  new contemporary look. When this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley  I'd actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer  or any other trailer. So I can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion. I decided I had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of Airstream. What I discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces. In that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight  modern  futuristic  high tech pod for hurtling down the freeway  and the interiors were completely out of sync with that. In fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin. That seemed really like a crisis to me  that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape  and about travel  and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell. We really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer  and what feels like it has true purpose and utility. We stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell. We took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing. I literally drew on the walls of the trailer  mocked it up in cardboard  we'd come in and cut  decide things were wrong  pull it out  put it back in. The main goal was to smooth out the interior  and begin to speak about motion  and mobility  and independence. The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer. There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together  where you can change materials and shapes. So that became a challenge. Compounding that  the material of choice  laminate  that I was trying to highlight  only bends in two dimensions. It's a compound curve interior. What I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell. What I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell. And what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space  so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way  and that the casework wouldn't break up the space. They also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin  so they function as an electrical chase. That's the trailer  pretty much finished. That trailer led to another commission  to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block. Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo  in October. Teruo Kurosaki  who owns a furniture company called Idee  he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo. He said one he would like to make a real trailer  functioning  and we would sell that one. Trailer number two  you have a blank slate  you can to anything you want. We came up with a fantasy scenario of a DJ traveling around the States  that would collect records and go on tours. This trailer housed two turntables  mixer  wet bar  fridge  integrated sound system. It's got a huge couch  fits quite a few people  and basically we'd had a great time with this. And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel  and escape  in an idiosyncratic sense. A lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for Airstream. This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream. They came to me and said   Well  what can we do to freshen this thing up  And do you think kids  you know  skateboarders  surfers  rock climbers  would use these things   And I said   Well  not in that interior.  Anyway  I went out to Airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype  and it's called the Bambi prototype. I thought   Finally  oh yeah great  big company  I'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding.  And I walked in their prototype facility  and it's exactly like my shop  only bigger    same tools  same things. So the problem became    and they set this dilemma to me    that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology  and there's no money for tooling or molding. The trailers themselves are actually hand built. All the casework is hand scribed in  uniquely  so you can't just cut     parts for     trailers  you have to cut them big  and every single one is hand fit. They didn't want to go to a componentized system. And there it is  that's the Bambi   . I thought I'd begin with a scene of war. There was little to warn of the danger ahead. The Iraqi insurgent had placed the IED  an Improvised Explosive Device  along the side of the road with great care. By       there were more than       of these attacks every single month  and they were the leading cause of casualties among American soldiers and Iraqi civilians. The team that was hunting for this IED is called an EOD team  Explosives Ordinance Disposal and they're the pointy end of the spear in the American effort to suppress these roadside bombs. Each EOD team goes out on about     of these bomb calls every year  defusing about two bombs a day. Perhaps the best sign of how valuable they are to the war effort  is that the Iraqi insurgents put a         bounty on the head of a single EOD soldier. Unfortunately  this particular call would not end well. By the time the soldier advanced close enough to see the telltale wires of the bomb  it exploded in a wave of flame. Now  depending how close you are and how much explosive has been packed into that bomb  it can cause death or injury. You have to be as far as    yards away to escape that. The blast is so strong it can even break your limbs  even if you're not hit. That soldier had been on top of the bomb. And so when the rest of the team advanced they found little left. And that night the unit's commander did a sad duty  and he wrote a condolence letter back to the United States  and he talked about how hard the loss had been on his unit  about the fact that they had lost their bravest soldier  a soldier who had saved their lives many a time. And he apologized for not being able to bring them home. But then he talked up the silver lining that he took away from the loss.  At least   as he wrote   when a robot dies  you don't have to write a letter to its mother.  That scene sounds like science fiction  but is battlefield reality already. The soldier in that case was a    pound robot called a PackBot. The chief's letter went  not to some farmhouse in Iowa like you see in the old war movies  but went to the iRobot Company  which is named after the Asimov novel and the not so great Will Smith movie  and... um...  Laughter ... if you remember that in that fictional world  robots started out carrying out mundane chores  and then they started taking on life and death decisions. That's a reality we face today. What we're going to do is actually just flash a series of photos behind me that show you the reality of robots used in war right now or already at the prototype stage. It's just to give you a taste. Another way of putting it is you're not going to see anything that's powered by Vulcan technology  or teenage wizard hormones or anything like that. This is all real. So why don't we go ahead and start those pictures. Something big is going on in war today  and maybe even the history of humanity itself. The U.S. military went into Iraq with a handful of drones in the air. We now have      . We went in with zero unmanned ground systems. We now have       . And the tech term  killer application  takes on new meaning in this space. And we need to remember that we're talking about the Model T Fords  the Wright Flyers  compared to what's coming soon. That's where we're at right now. One of the people that I recently met with was an Air Force three star general  and he said basically  where we're headed very soon is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts  and these numbers matter  because we're not just talking about tens of thousands of today's robots  but tens of thousands of these prototypes and tomorrow's robots  because of course  one of the things that's operating in technology is Moore's Law  that you can pack in more and more computing power into those robots  and so flash forward around    years  if Moore's Law holds true  those robots will be close to a billion times more powerful in their computing than today. And so what that means is the kind of things that we used to only talk about at science fiction conventions like Comic Con have to be talked about in the halls of power and places like the Pentagon. A robots revolution is upon us. Now  I need to be clear here. I'm not talking about a revolution where you have to worry about the Governor of California showing up at your door  a la the Terminator.  Laughter  When historians look at this period  they're going to conclude that we're in a different type of revolution  a revolution in war  like the invention of the atomic bomb. But it may be even bigger than that  because our unmanned systems don't just affect the  how  of war fighting  they affect the  who  of fighting at its most fundamental level. That is  every previous revolution in war  be it the machine gun  be it the atomic bomb  was about a system that either shot faster  went further  had a bigger boom. That's certainly the case with robotics  but they also change the experience of the warrior and even the very identity of the warrior. Another way of putting this is that mankind's       year old monopoly on the fighting of war is breaking down in our very lifetime. I've spent the last several years going around meeting with all the players in this field  from the robot scientists to the science fiction authors who inspired them to the    year old drone pilots who are fighting from Nevada  to the four star generals who command them  to even the Iraqi insurgents who they are targeting and what they think about our systems  and what I found interesting is not just their stories  but how their experiences point to these ripple effects that are going outwards in our society  in our law and our ethics  etc. And so what I'd like to do with my remaining time is basically flesh out a couple of these. So the first is that the future of war  even a robotics one  is not going to be purely an American one. The U.S. is currently ahead in military robotics right now  but we know that in technology there's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage. In a quick show of hands  how many people in this room still use Wang Computers   Laughter  It's the same thing in war. The British and the French invented the tank. The Germans figured out how to use it right  and so what we have to think about for the U.S. is that we are ahead right now  but you have    other countries out there working on military robotics  and they include all the interesting countries like Russia  China  Pakistan  Iran. And this raises a bigger worry for me. How do we move forward in this revolution given the state of our manufacturing and the state of our science and mathematics training in our schools  Or another way of thinking about this is  what does it mean to go to war increasingly with soldiers whose hardware is made in China and software is written in India  But just as software has gone open source  so has warfare. Unlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb  you don't need a massive manufacturing system to build robotics. A lot of it is off the shelf. A lot of it's even do it yourself. One of those things you just saw flashed before you was a raven drone  the handheld tossed one. For about a thousand dollars  you can build one yourself  equivalent to what the soldiers use in Iraq. That raises another wrinkle when it comes to war and conflict. Good guys might play around and work on these as hobby kits  but so might bad guys. This cross between robotics and things like terrorism is going to be fascinating and even disturbing  and we've already seen it start. During the war between Israel  a state  and Hezbollah  a non state actor  the non state actor flew four different drones against Israel. There's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an IED in Iraq while sitting at your home computer. And so I think what we're going to see is two trends take place with this. First is  you're going to reinforce the power of individuals against governments  but then the second is that we are going to see an expansion in the realm of terrorism. The future of it may be a cross between al Qaeda  .  and the next generation of the Unabomber. And another way of thinking about this is the fact that  remember  you don't have to convince a robot that they're gonna receive    virgins after they die to convince them to blow themselves up. But the ripple effects of this are going to go out into our politics. One of the people that I met with was a former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Ronald Reagan  and he put it this way   I like these systems because they save American lives  but I worry about more marketization of wars  more shock and awe talk  to defray discussion of the costs. People are more likely to support the use of force if they view it as costless.  Robots for me take certain trends that are already in play in our body politic  and maybe take them to their logical ending point. We don't have a draft. We don't have declarations of war anymore. We don't buy war bonds anymore. And now we have the fact that we're converting more and more of our American soldiers that we would send into harm's way into machines  and so we may take those already lowering bars to war and drop them to the ground. But the future of war is also going to be a YouTube war. That is  our new technologies don't merely remove humans from risk. They also record everything that they see. So they don't just delink the public  they reshape its relationship with war. There's already several thousand video clips of combat footage from Iraq on YouTube right now  most of it gathered by drones. Now  this could be a good thing. It could be building connections between the home front and the war front as never before. But remember  this is taking place in our strange  weird world  and so inevitably the ability to download these video clips to  you know  your iPod or your Zune gives you the ability to turn it into entertainment. Soldiers have a name for these clips. They call it war porn. The typical one that I was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a Predator strike taking out an enemy site. Missile hits  bodies burst into the air with the explosion. It was set to music. It was set to the pop song  I Just Want To Fly  by Sugar Ray. This ability to watch more but experience less creates a wrinkle in the public's relationship with war. I think about this with a sports parallel. It's like the difference between watching an NBA game  a professional basketball game on TV  where the athletes are tiny figures on the screen  and being at that basketball game in person and realizing what someone seven feet really does look like. But we have to remember  these are just the clips. These are just the ESPN SportsCenter version of the game. They lose the context. They lose the strategy. They lose the humanity. War just becomes slam dunks and smart bombs. Now the irony of all this is that while the future of war may involve more and more machines  it's our human psychology that's driving all of this  it's our human failings that are leading to these wars. So one example of this that has big resonance in the policy realm is how this plays out on our very real war of ideas that we're fighting against radical groups. What is the message that we think we are sending with these machines versus what is being received in terms of the message. So one of the people that I met was a senior Bush Administration official  who had this to say about our unmanning of war   It plays to our strength. The thing that scares people is our technology.  But when you go out and meet with people  for example in Lebanon  it's a very different story. One of the people I met with there was a news editor  and we're talking as a drone is flying above him  and this is what he had to say.  This is just another sign of the coldhearted cruel Israelis and Americans  who are cowards because they send out machines to fight us. They don't want to fight us like real men  but they're afraid to fight  so we just have to kill a few of their soldiers to defeat them.  The future of war also is featuring a new type of warrior  and it's actually redefining the experience of going to war. You can call this a cubicle warrior. This is what one Predator drone pilot described of his experience fighting in the Iraq War while never leaving Nevada.  You're going to war for    hours  shooting weapons at targets  directing kills on enemy combatants  and then you get in the car and you drive home and within    minutes  you're sitting at the dinner table talking to your kids about their homework.  Now  the psychological balancing of those experiences is incredibly tough  and in fact those drone pilots have higher rates of PTSD than many of the units physically in Iraq. But some have worries that this disconnection will lead to something else  that it might make the contemplation of war crimes a lot easier when you have this distance.  It's like a video game   is what one young pilot described to me of taking out enemy troops from afar. As anyone who's played Grand Theft Auto knows  we do things in the video world that we wouldn't do face to face. So much of what you're hearing from me is that there's another side to technologic revolutions  and that it's shaping our present and maybe will shape our future of war. Moore's Law is operative  but so's Murphy's Law. The fog of war isn't being lifted. The enemy has a vote. We're gaining incredible new capabilities  but we're also seeing and experiencing new human dilemmas. Now  sometimes these are just  oops  moments  which is what the head of a robotics company described it  you just have  oops  moments. Well  what are  oops  moments with robots in war  Well  sometimes they're funny. Sometimes  they're like that scene from the Eddie Murphy movie  Best Defense   playing out in reality  where they tested out a machine gun armed robot  and during the demonstration it started spinning in a circle and pointed its machine gun at the reviewing stand of VIPs. Fortunately the weapon wasn't loaded and no one was hurt  but other times  oops  moments are tragic  such as last year in South Africa  where an anti aircraft cannon had a  software glitch   and actually did turn on and fired  and nine soldiers were killed. We have new wrinkles in the laws of war and accountability. What do we do with things like unmanned slaughter  What is unmanned slaughter  We've already had three instances of Predator drone strikes where we thought we got bin Laden  and it turned out not to be the case. And this is where we're at right now. This is not even talking about armed  autonomous systems with full authority to use force. And do not believe that that isn't coming. During my research I came across four different Pentagon projects on different aspects of that. And so you have this question  what does this lead to issues like war crimes  Robots are emotionless  so they don't get upset if their buddy is killed. They don't commit crimes of rage and revenge. But robots are emotionless. They see an    year old grandmother in a wheelchair the same way they see a T    tank  they're both just a series of zeroes and ones. And so we have this question to figure out  How do we catch up our   th century laws of war  that are so old right now that they could qualify for Medicare  to these   st century technologies  And so  in conclusion  I've talked about what seems the future of war  but notice that I've only used real world examples and you've only seen real world pictures and videos. And so this sets a great challenge for all of us that we have to worry about well before you have to worry about your Roomba sucking the life away from you. Are we going to let the fact that what's unveiling itself right now in war sounds like science fiction and therefore keeps us in denial  Are we going to face the reality of   st century war  Is our generation going to make the same mistake that a past generation did with atomic weaponry  and not deal with the issues that surround it until Pandora's box is already opened up  Now  I could be wrong on this  and one Pentagon robot scientist told me that I was. He said   There's no real social  ethical  moral issues when it comes to robots. That is   he added   unless the machine kills the wrong people repeatedly. Then it's just a product recall issue.  And so the ending point for this is that actually  we can turn to Hollywood. A few years ago  Hollywood gathered all the top characters and created a list of the top     heroes and top     villains of all of Hollywood history  the characters that represented the best and worst of humanity. Only one character made it onto both lists  The Terminator  a robot killing machine. And so that points to the fact that our machines can be used for both good and evil  but for me it points to the fact that there's a duality of humans as well. This week is a celebration of our creativity. Our creativity has taken our species to the stars. Our creativity has created works of arts and literature to express our love. And now  we're using our creativity in a certain direction  to build fantastic machines with incredible capabilities  maybe even one day an entirely new species. But one of the main reasons that we're doing that is because of our drive to destroy each other  and so the question we all should ask  is it our machines  or is it us that's wired for war  Thank you.  Applause  One thing I wanted to say about film making is    about this film    in thinking about some of the wonderful talks we've heard here  Michael Moschen  and some of the talks about music  this idea that there is a narrative line  and that music exists in time. A film also exists in time  it's an experience that you should go through emotionally. And in making this film I felt that so many of the documentaries I've seen were all about learning something  or knowledge  or driven by talking heads  and driven by ideas. And I wanted this film to be driven by emotions  and really to follow my journey. So instead of doing the talking head thing  instead it's composed of scenes  and we meet people along the way. We only meet them once. They don't come back several times  so it really chronicles a journey. It's something like life  that once you get in it you can't get out. There are two clips I want to show you  the first one is a kind of hodgepodge  its just three little moments  four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight. It's not the way they occur in the film  because they are part of much larger scenes. They play off each other in a wonderful way. And that ends with a little clip of my father  of Lou  talking about something that is very dear to him  which is the accidents of life. I think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental  and perhaps not planned at all. And those three clips will be followed by a scene of perhaps what  to me  is really his greatest building which is a building in Dhaka  Bangladesh. He built the capital over there. And I think you'll enjoy this building  it's never been seen    it's been still photographed  but never photographed by a film crew. We were the first film crew in there. So you'll see images of this remarkable building. A couple of things to keep in mind when you see it  it was built entirely by hand  I think they got a crane the last year. It was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding  people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads  dumping them in the forms. It is the capital of the country  and it took    years to build  which is something they seem to be very proud of over there. It took as long as the Taj Mahal. Unfortunately it took so long that Lou never saw it finished. He died in     . The building was finished in     . So it continued on for many years after he died. Think about that when you see that building  that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished. And that really struck me about my father  in the sense that he had such belief that somehow  doing these things giving in the way that he gave  that something good would come out of it  even in the middle of a war  there was a war with Pakistan at one point  and the construction stopped totally and he kept working  because he felt   Well when the war is done they'll need this building.  So  those are the two clips I'm going to show. Roll that tape. Richard Saul Wurman  I remember hearing him talk at Penn. And I came home and I said to my father and mother   I just met this man  doesn't have much work  and he's sort of ugly  funny voice  and he's a teacher at school. I know you've never heard of him  but just mark this day that someday you will hear of him  because he's really an amazing man.  Frank Gehry  I heard he had some kind of a fling with Ingrid Bergman. Is that true  Nathaniel Kahn  If he did he was a very lucky man. NK  Did you hear that  really  FG  Yeah  when he was in Rome. Moshe Safdie  He was a real nomad. And you know  when I knew him when I was in the office  he would come in from a trip  and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely  and he would pack up and go. You know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him. I mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station  it was so consistent with his life  you know  I mean I often think I'm going to die in a plane  or I'm going to die in an airport  or die jogging without an identification on me. I don't know why I sort of carry that from that memory of the way he died. But he was a sort of a nomad at heart. Louis Kahn  How accidental our existences are really and how full of influence by circumstance. Man  We are the morning workers who come  all the time  here and enjoy the walking  city's beauty and the atmosphere and this is the nicest place of Bangladesh. We are proud of it. NK  You're proud of it  Man  Yes  it is the national image of Bangladesh. NK  Do you know anything about the architect  Man  Architect  I've heard about him  he's a top ranking architect. NK  Well actually I'm here because I'm the architect's son  he was my father. Man  Oh  Dad is Louis Farrakhan  NK  Yeah. No not Louis Farrakhan  Louis Kahn. Man  Louis Kahn  yes  Man  Your father  is he alive  NK  No  he's been dead for    years. Man  Very pleased to welcome you back. NK  Thank you. NK  He never saw it finished  Pop. No  he never saw this. Shamsul Wares  It was almost impossible  building for a country like ours. In        years back  it was nothing  only paddy fields  and since we invited him here  he felt that he has got a responsibility. He wanted to be a Moses here  he gave us democracy. He is not a political man  but in this guise he has given us the institution for democracy  from where we can rise. In that way it is so relevant. He didn't care for how much money this country has  or whether he would be able to ever finish this building  but somehow he has been able to do it  build it  here. And this is the largest project he has got in here  the poorest country in the world. NK  It cost him his life. SW  Yeah  he paid. He paid his life for this  and that is why he is great and we'll remember him. But he was also human. Now his failure to satisfy the family life  is an inevitable association of great people. But I think his son will understand this  and will have no sense of grudge  or sense of being neglected  I think. He cared in a very different manner  but it takes a lot of time to understand that. In social aspect of his life he was just like a child  he was not at all matured. He could not say no to anything  and that is why  that he cannot say no to things  we got this building today. You see  only that way you can be able to understand him. There is no other shortcut  no other way to really understand him. But I think he has given us this building and we feel all the time for him  that's why  he has given love for us. He could not probably give the right kind of love for you  but for us  he has given the people the right kind of love  that is important. You have to understand that. He had an enormous amount of love  he loved everybody. To love everybody  he sometimes did not see the very closest ones  and that is inevitable for men of his stature. What I'm going to try to do is explain to you quickly how to predict  and illustrate it with some predictions about what Iran is going to do in the next couple of years. In order to predict effectively  we need to use science. And the reason that we need to use science is because then we can reproduce what we're doing  it's not just wisdom or guesswork. And if we can predict  then we can engineer the future. So if you are concerned to influence energy policy  or you are concerned to influence national security policy  or health policy  or education  science    and a particular branch of science    is a way to do it  not the way we've been doing it  which is seat of the pants wisdom. Now before I get into how to do it let me give you a little truth in advertising  because I'm not engaged in the business of magic. There are lots of thing that the approach I take can predict  and there are some that it can't. It can predict complex negotiations or situations involving coercion    that is in essence everything that has to do with politics  much of what has to do with business  but sorry  if you're looking to speculate in the stock market  I don't predict stock markets    OK  it's not going up any time really soon. But I'm not engaged in doing that. I'm not engaged in predicting random number generators. I actually get phone calls from people who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win. I don't have a clue. I engage in the use of game theory  game theory is a branch of mathematics and that means  sorry  that even in the study of politics  math has come into the picture. We can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics  we need to look at this in a rigorous way. Now  what is game theory about  It assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them. That doesn't seem terribly shocking    although it's controversial for a lot of people    that we are self interested. In order to look out for what's best for them or what they think is best for them  people have values    they identify what they want  and what they don't want. And they have beliefs about what other people want  and what other people don't want  how much power other people have  how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want. And they face limitations  constraints  they may be weak  they may be located in the wrong part of the world  they may be Einstein  stuck away farming someplace in a rural village in India not being noticed  as was the case for Ramanujan for a long time  a great mathematician but nobody noticed. Now who is rational  A lot of people are worried about what is rationality about  You know  what if people are rational  Mother Theresa  she was rational. Terrorists  they're rational. Pretty much everybody is rational. I think there are only two exceptions that I'm aware of    two year olds  they are not rational  they have very fickle preferences  they switch what they think all the time  and schizophrenics are probably not rational  but pretty much everybody else is rational. That is  they are just trying to do what they think is in their own best interest. Now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests  we have to think about who has influence in the world. If you're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior  with regard to producing pollutants  one approach  the common approach  is to exhort them to be better  to explain to them what damage they're doing to the planet. And many of you may have noticed that doesn't have as big an effect  as perhaps you would like it to have. But if you show them that it's in their interest  then they're responsive. So  we have to work out who influences problems. If we're looking at Iran  the president of the United States we would like to think  may have some influence    certainly the president in Iran has some influence    but we make a mistake if we just pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder because that person doesn't know much about Iran  or about energy policy  or about health care  or about any particular policy. That person surrounds himself or herself with advisers. If we're talking about national security problems  maybe it's the Secretary of State  maybe it's the Secretary of Defense  the Director of National Intelligence  maybe the ambassador to the United Nations  or somebody else who they think is going to know more about the particular problem. But let's face it  the Secretary of State doesn't know much about Iran. The secretary of defense doesn't know much about Iran. Each of those people in turn has advisers who advise them  so they can advise the president. There are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome  not just the people at the pinnacle of the decision making pyramid. Unfortunately  a lot of times we don't do that. There's a good reason that we don't do that  and there's a good reason that using game theory and computers  we can overcome the limitation of just looking at a few people. Imagine a problem with just five decision makers. Imagine for example that Sally over here  wants to know what Harry  and Jane  and George and Frank are thinking  and sends messages to those people. Sally's giving her opinion to them  and they're giving their opinion to Sally. But Sally also wants to know what Harry is saying to these three  and what they're saying to Harry. And Harry wants to know what each of those people are saying to each other  and so on  and Sally would like to know what Harry thinks those people are saying. That's a complicated problem  that's a lot to know. With five decision makers there are a lot of linkages         as a matter of fact  if you remember your factorials. Five factorial is    . Now you may be surprised to know that smart people can keep     things straight in their head. Suppose we double the number of influencers from five to   . Does that mean we've doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know  from     to      No. How about    times  To        No. We've increased it to  .  million. Nobody can keep that straight in their head. But computers  they can. They don't need coffee breaks  they don't need vacations  they don't need to go to sleep at night  they don't ask for raises either. They can keep this information straight and that means that we can process the information. So I'm going to talk to you about how to process it  and I'm going to give you some examples out of Iran  and you're going to be wondering   Why should we listen to this guy  Why should we believe what he's saying   So I'm going to show you a factoid. This is an assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency of the percentage of time that the model I'm talking about is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known  when the experts who provided the data inputs got it wrong. That's not my claim  that's a CIA claim    you can read it  it was declassified a while ago. You can read it in a volume edited by H. Bradford Westerfield  Yale University Press. So  what do we need to know in order to predict  You may be surprised to find out we don't need to know very much. We do need to know who has a stake in trying to shape the outcome of a decision. We need to know what they say they want  not what they want in their heart of hearts  not what they think they can get  but what they say they want  because that is a strategically chosen position  and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision making. We need to know how focused they are on the problem at hand. That is  how willing are they to drop what they're doing when the issue comes up  and attend to it instead of something else that's on their plate    how big a deal is it to them  And how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to engage on the issue  If we know those things we can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody cares about two things on any decision. They care about the outcome. They'd like an outcome as close to what they are interested in as possible. They're careerists  they also care about getting credit    there's ego involvement  they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome  or as important  if it's their druthers  to block an outcome. And so we have to figure out how they balance those two things. Different people trade off between standing by their outcome  faithfully holding to it  going down in a blaze of glory  or giving it up  putting their finger in the wind  and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position. Most people fall in between  and if we can work out where they fall we can work out how to negotiate with them to change their behavior. So with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have  what the chances are that they're willing to take  what they're after  what they value  what they want  and what they believe about other people. You might notice what we don't need to know  there's no history in here. How they got to where they are may be important in shaping the input information  but once we know where they are we're worried about where they're going to be headed in the future. How they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting. I remind you of that    percent accuracy rate. So where are we going to get this information  We can get this information from the Internet  from The Economist  The Financial Times  The New York Times  U.S. News and World Report  lots of sources like that  or we can get it from asking experts who spend their lives studying places and problems  because those experts know this information. If they don't know  who are the people trying to influence the decision  how much clout do they have  how much they care about this issue  and what do they say they want  are they experts  That's what it means to be an expert  that's the basic stuff an expert needs to know. Alright  lets turn to Iran. Let me make three important predictions    you can check this out  time will tell. What is Iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program  How secure is the theocratic regime in Iran  What's its future  And everybody's best friend  Ahmadinejad. How are things going for him  How are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two  You take a look at this  this is not based on statistics. I want to be very clear here. I'm not projecting some past data into the future. I've taken inputs on positions and so forth  run it through a computer model that had simulated the dynamics of interaction  and these are the simulated dynamics  the predictions about the path of policy. So you can see here on the vertical axis  I haven't shown it all the way down to zero  there are lots of other options  but here I'm just showing you the prediction  so I've narrowed the scale. Up at the top of the axis   Build the Bomb.  At      we start somewhere above      between building a bomb  and making enough weapons grade fuel so that you could build a bomb. That's where  according to my analyses  the Iranians were at the beginning of this year. And then the model makes predictions down the road. At     they would only produce enough weapons grade fuel to show that they know how  but they wouldn't build a weapon  they would build a research quantity. It would achieve some national pride  but not go ahead and build a weapon. And down at     they would build civilian nuclear energy  which is what they say is their objective. The yellow line shows us the most likely path. The yellow line includes an analysis of    decision makers in Iran  and a vast number of outside influencers trying to pressure Iran into changing its behavior  various players in the United States  and Egypt  and Saudi Arabia  and Russia  European Union  Japan  so on and so forth. The white line reproduces the analysis if the international environment just left Iran to make its own internal decisions  under its own domestic political pressures. That's not going to be happening  but you can see that the line comes down faster if they're not put under international pressure  if they're allowed to pursue their own devices. But in any event  by the end of this year  beginning of next year  we get to a stable equilibrium outcome. And that equilibrium is not what the United States would like  but it's probably an equilibrium that the United States can live with  and that a lot of others can live with. And that is that Iran will achieve that nationalist pride by making enough weapons grade fuel  through research  so that they could show that they know how to make weapons grade fuel  but not enough to actually build a bomb. How is this happening  Over here you can see this is the distribution of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today  this is what that power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of       early parts of     . Just about nobody supports research on weapons grade fuel today  but by      that gets to be a big block  and you put these two together  that's the controlling influence in Iran. Out here today  there are a bunch of people    Ahmadinejad for example    who would like not only to build a bomb  but test a bomb. That power disappears completely  nobody supports that by     . These guys are all shrinking  the power is all drifting out here  so the outcome is going to be the weapons grade fuel. Who are the winners and who are the losers in Iran  Take a look at these guys  they're growing in power  and by the way  this was done a while ago before the current economic crisis  and that's probably going to get steeper. These folks are the moneyed interests in Iran  the bankers  the oil people  the bazaaries. They are growing in political clout  as the mullahs are isolating themselves    with the exception of one group of mullahs  who are not well known to Americans. That's this line here  growing in power  these are what the Iranians call the quietists. These are the Ayatollahs  mostly based in Qom  who have great clout in the religious community  have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder  because they see Iran going in an unhealthy direction  a direction contrary to what Khomeini had in mind. Here is Mr. Ahmadinejad. Two things to notice  he's getting weaker  and while he gets a lot of attention in the United States  he is not a major player in Iran. He is on the way down. OK  so I'd like you to take a little away from this. Everything is not predictable  the stock market is  at least for me  not predictable  but most complicated negotiations are predictable. Again  whether we're talking health policy  education  environment  energy  litigation  mergers  all of these are complicated problems that are predictable  that this sort of technology can be applied to. And the reason that being able to predict those things is important  is not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it  but because if you can predict what people will do  you can engineer what they will do. And if you engineer what they do you can change the world  you can get a better result. I would like to leave you with one thought  which is for me  the dominant theme of this gathering  and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world. When people say to you   That's impossible   you say back to them   When you say 'That's impossible ' you're confused with  'I don't know how to do it.'  Thank you. Chris Anderson  One question for you. That was fascinating. I love that you put it out there. I got very nervous halfway through the talk though  just panicking whether you'd included in your model  the possibility that putting this prediction out there might change the result. We've got     people in Tehran who watch TEDTalks. Bruce Bueno de Mesquita  I've thought about that  and since I've done a lot of work for the intelligence community  they've also pondered that. It would be a good thing if people paid more attention  took seriously  and engaged in the same sorts of calculations  because it would change things. But it would change things in two beneficial ways. It would hasten how quickly people arrive at an agreement  and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time. And  it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with  without having to manipulate them so much    which is basically what I do  I manipulate them. So it would be a good thing. CA  So you're kind of trying to say   People of Iran  this is your destiny  lets go there.  BBM  Well  people of Iran  this is what many of you are going to evolve to want  and we could get there a lot sooner  and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions  and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end  and the world would be a better place. CA  Here's hoping they hear it that way. Thank you very much Bruce. BBM  Thank you. Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth. They've been here for billions of years  and what they are are single celled microscopic organisms. So they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of DNA. They have very few genes  and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out. And the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment  they grow to twice their size  they cut themselves down in the middle  and one cell becomes two  and so on and so on. They just grow and divide  and grow and divide    so a kind of boring life  except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters. I know you guys think of yourself as humans  and this is sort of how I think of you. This man is supposed to represent a generic human being  and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body. There is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do  but you have    trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life. So     times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being. And of course it's the DNA that counts  so here's all the A  T  Gs and Cs that make up your genetic code  and give you all your charming characteristics. You have about        genes. Well it turns out you have     times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life. At the best  you're    percent human  but more likely about one percent human  depending on which of these metrics you like. I know you think of yourself as human beings  but I think of you as    or    percent bacterial. These bacteria are not passive riders  these are incredibly important  they keep us alive. They cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy. They digest our food  they make our vitamins  they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out. So they do all these amazing things that help us and are vital for keeping us alive  and they never get any press for that. But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well. So  there's all kinds of bacteria on the Earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time  and if they are  they make you incredibly sick. And so  the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do  or all the bad things that bacteria do. The question we had is how could they do anything at all  I mean they're incredibly small  you have to have a microscope to see one. They live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide  and they've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms. And so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals. And so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way that bacteria live. The clue to this came from another marine bacterium  and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri. What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium  a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean  named Vibrio fischeri. This bacterium has the special property that it makes light  so it makes bioluminescence  like fireflies make light. We're not doing anything to the cells here. We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room  and this is what we see. What was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light  but when the bacteria made light. What we noticed is when the bacteria were alone  so when they were in dilute suspension  they made no light. But when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously. The question that we had is how can bacteria  these primitive organisms  tell the difference from times when they're alone  and times when they're in a community  and then all do something together. What we've figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other  and they talk with a chemical language. This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell. When it's alone it doesn't make any light. But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones  and these are the red triangles  and when the bacteria is alone the molecules just float away and so no light. But when the bacteria grow and double and they're all participating in making these molecules  the molecule    the extracellular amount of that molecule increases in proportion to cell number. And when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are  they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony. That's how bioluminescence works    they're talking with these chemical words. The reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology. Again  another plug for the animals in the ocean  Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid. What you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid  and it's been turned on its back  and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these house the Vibrio fischeri cells  they live in there  at high cell number that molecule is there  and they're making light. The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light. The way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii  just in sort of shallow knee deep water. The squid is nocturnal  so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps  but then at night it has to come out to hunt. On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in  since it's just in those couple feet of water. What the squid has developed is a shutter that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria. Then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back. And it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom    which is made by the bacterium    exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back  so the squid doesn't make a shadow. It actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter illuminate itself in an anti predation device so predators can't see its shadow  calculate its trajectory  and eat it. This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean. But then if you think about it  the squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying  thick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that. And so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep  it buries itself in the sand  and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm  and when the sun comes up it pumps out like    percent of the bacteria. Now the bacteria are dilute  that little hormone molecule is gone  so they're not making light    but of course the squid doesn't care. It's asleep in the sand. And as the day goes by the bacteria double  they release the molecule  and then light comes on at night  exactly when the squid wants it. First we figured out how this bacterium does this  but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this to figure out really what's the mechanism. And what we found    so this is now supposed to be  again  my bacterial cell    is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein    that's the red box    it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule  the red triangle. And then as the cells grow  they're all releasing that molecule into the environment  so there's lots of molecule there. And the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule. These are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells. When the molecule increases to a certain amount    which says something about the number of cells    it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light. Why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous  glow in the dark bacterium that lives in the ocean    all bacteria have systems like this. So now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other. They make chemical words  they recognize those words  and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison. We have a fancy name for this  we call it quorum sensing. They vote with these chemical votes  the vote gets counted  and then everybody responds to the vote. What's important for today's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions. But the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence. It's not like a couple bacteria get in you and they start secreting some toxins    you're enormous  that would have no effect on you. You're huge. What they do  we now understand  is they get in you  they wait  they start growing  they count themselves with these little molecules  and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together  they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host. Bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing. That's how it works. We also then went to look at what are these molecules    these were the red triangles on my slides before. This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule. This is the word that it talks with. So then we started to look at other bacteria  and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered. What I hope you can see is that the molecules are related. The left hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria. But the right hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species. What that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages. Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other. So these are private  secret conversations. These conversations are for intraspecies communication. Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language that allows it to count its own siblings. Once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors. But what we were really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves  they live in incredible mixtures  with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria. And that's depicted on this slide. This is your skin. So this is just a picture    a micrograph of your skin. Anywhere on your body  it looks pretty much like this  and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there. And so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria  and it's about counting your neighbors  it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species. There has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population. So we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria  and what we've found now is that in fact  bacteria are multilingual. They all have a species specific system    they have a molecule that says  me.  But then  running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered  that's generic. So  they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor  and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria. It's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication. What happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you. They take that information inside  and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population. Then again we turn to chemistry  and we figured out what this generic molecule is    that was the pink ovals on my last slide  this is it. It's a very small  five carbon molecule. What the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule. So they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication. This is the bacterial Esperanto. Once we got that far  we started to learn that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language. But what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well. I've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors  they communicate with these molecules. Of course  I've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing. We thought  what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear  Couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics  Of course  you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics. Bacteria are incredibly multi drug resistant right now  and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria. They either pop the bacterial membrane  they make the bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA. We kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants. And so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases. We thought  well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications  just make these bacteria so they can't talk  they can't count  and they don't know to launch virulence. And so that's exactly what we've done  and we've sort of taken two strategies. The first one is we've targeted the intraspecies communication system. So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules    which you saw    but they're a little bit different. And so they lock into those receptors  and they jam recognition of the real thing. By targeting the red system  what we are able to do is to make species specific  or disease specific  anti quorum sensing molecules. We've also done the same thing with the pink system. We've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we've made antagonists of the interspecies communication system. The hope is that these will be used as broad spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria. To finish I'll just show you the strategy. In this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule  but the logic is exactly the same. What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal  in this case  a mouse  it doesn't initiate virulence right away. It gets in  it starts growing  it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules. It recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they're going to launch their attack  and the animal dies. What we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections  but we give them in conjunction with our anti quorum sensing molecules    so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing  but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide. What we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium    a multi drug resistant pathogenic bacterium    in the same time we give our anti quorum sensing molecule  in fact  the animal lives. We think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around  at least initially  this big problem of resistance. What I hope you think  is that bacteria can talk to each other  they use chemicals as their words  they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about. Of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular. So in the spirit of TED they're doing things together because it makes a difference. What happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors  and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals. What I would hope that I could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity. Bacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years  humans  couple hundred thousand. We think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular organization works. We think  by studying bacteria  we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body. We know that the principles and the rules  if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms  the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well. I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other. By using these two molecules they can say  me  and they can say  you.  Again of course that's what we do  both in a molecular way  and also in an outward way  but I think about the molecular stuff. This is exactly what happens in your body. It's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day  and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on  these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is  and what their tasks should be. Again  we think that bacteria invented that  and you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles  but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study. The final thing is  again just to reiterate that there's this practical part  and so we've made these anti quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics. But then  to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the Earth  we've also made pro quorum sensing molecules. So  we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better. Remember you have these    times or more bacterial cells in you or on you  keeping you healthy. What we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you  in the hopes of making you more healthy  making those conversations better  so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own. Finally  I wanted to show you this is my gang at Princeton  New Jersey. Everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture. I hope when you learn things  like about how the natural world works    I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child. Science is done by that demographic. All of those people are between    and    years old  and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country. It's a really lucky demographic to work with. I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age  and it's just a crazy delightful job. I want to thank you for inviting me here. It's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference. Thanks. I am going to talk about myself  which I rarely do  because I    well for one thing  I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about. And secondly  I'm a recovering narcissist. I didn't know I was a narcissist actually. I thought narcissism meant you loved yourself. And then someone told me there is a flip side to it. So it's actually drearier than self love  it's unrequited self love. I don't feel I can afford a relapse. But I want to  though  explain how I came to design my own particular brand of comedy because I've been through so many different forms of it. I started with improvisation  in a particular form of improvisation called theater games  which had one rule  which I always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society. And the rule was  you couldn't deny the other person's reality  you could only build on it. And of course we live in a society that's all about contradicting other peoples' reality. It's all about contradiction  which I think is why I'm so sensitive to contradiction in general. I see it everywhere. Like polls. You know  it's always curious to me that in public opinion polls the percentage of Americans who don't know the answer to any given question is always two percent.    percent of Americans think Alaska is part of Canada. But only two percent don't know the effect that the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF's monetary policy    seems a contradiction. Or this ad that I read in the New York Times   Wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society. Buying it from us screams good taste.  Or this that I found in a magazine called California Lawyer  in an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at Enron.  Surviving the Slammer  Do's and Don'ts.   Don't use big words.   Learn the lingua franca.  Yeah.  Lingua this  Frankie.  And I suppose it's a contradiction that I talk about science when I don't know math. You know  because    and by the way to I was so grateful to Dean Kamen for pointing out that one of the reasons  that there are cultural reasons that women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology    because for instance  the reason I don't do math is  I was taught to do math and read at the same time. So you're six years old  you're reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarves  and it becomes rapidly obvious that there are only two kinds of men in the world  dwarves and Prince Charmings. And the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince. That's why little girls don't do math. It's too depressing. Of course  by talking about science I also may  as I did the other night  incur the violent wrath of some scientists who were very upset with me. I used the word postmodern as if it were OK. And they got very upset. One of them  to his credit  I think really just wanted to engage me in a serious argument. But I don't engage in serious arguments. I don't approve of them because arguments  of course  are all about contradiction  and they're shaped by the values that I have questions with. I have questions with the values of Newtonian science  like rationality. You're supposed to be rational in an argument. Well rationality is constructed by what Christie Hefner was talking about today  that mind body split  you know  The head is good  body bad. Head is ego  body id. When we say  I      as when Rene Descartes said   I think therefore I am      we mean the head. And as David Lee Roth sang in  Just a Gigolo    I ain't got no body.  That's how you get rationality. And that's why so much of humor is the body asserting itself against the head. That's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor. That's why you have the Raspyni Brothers whacking Richard in the genital area. And we're laughing doubly then because he's the body  but it's also    Voice offstage  Richard. Emily Levine  Richard. What did I say  Richard. Yes but it's also the head  the head of the conference. That's the other way that humor    like Art Buchwald takes shots at the heads of state. It doesn't make quite as much money as body humor I'm sure    but nevertheless  what makes us treasure you and adore you. There's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though  which is  as much as we revere the head  we are very anti intellectual. I know this because I read in the New York Times  the Ayn Rand foundation took out a full page ad after September     in which they said   The problem is not Iraq or Iran  the problem in this country  facing this country is the university professors and their spawn.  So I went back and re read  The Fountainhead.  I don't know how many of you have read it. And I'm not an expert on sadomasochism. But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page    .  The act of a master taking painful contemptuous possession of her  was the kind of rapture she wanted. When they lay together in bed it was  as it had to be  as the nature of the act demanded  an act of violence. It was an act of clenched teeth and hatred. It was the unendurable. Not a caress  but a wave of pain. The agony as an act of passion.  So you can imagine my surprise on reading in The New Yorker that Alan Greenspan  Chairman of the Federal Reserve  claims Ayn Rand as his intellectual mentor. It's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix. Bad enough we had to see J. Edgar Hoover in a dress. Now we have to picture Alan Greenspan in a black leather corset  with a butt tattoo that says   Whip inflation now.  And Ayn Rand of course  Ayn Rand is famous for a philosophy called Objectivism  which reflects another value of Newtonian physics  which is objectivity. Objectivity basically is constructed in that same S M way. It's the subject subjugating the object. That's how you assert yourself. You make yourself the active voice. And the object is the passive no voice. I was so fascinated by that Oxygen commercial. I don't know if you know this but    maybe it's different now  or maybe you were making a statement    but in many hospital nurseries across the country  until very recently anyway  according to a book by Jessica Benjamin  the signs over the little boys cribs read   I'm a boy   and the signs over the little girls cribs read   It's a girl.  Yeah. So the passivity was culturally projected onto the little girls. And this still goes on as I think I told you last year. There's a poll that proves    there was a poll that was given by Time magazine  in which only men were asked   Have you ever had sex with a woman you actively disliked   And well  yeah. Well     percent said yes  which I think is overinflated though because so many men if you just say   Have you ever had sex ...    Yes   They don't even wait for the rest of it. And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had    That's the first callback  of my attempted quadruple. So this subject object thing  is part of something I'm very interested in because this is why  frankly  I believe in political correctness. I do. I think it can go too far. I think Ringling Brothers may have gone too far with an ad they took out in the New York Times Magazine.  We have a lifelong emotional and financial commitment to our Asian Elephant partners.  Maybe too far. But you know    I don't think that a person of color making fun of white people is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color. Or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women. Or poor people making fun of rich people  the same as rich people. I think you can make fun of the have but not the have nots  which is why you don't see me making fun of Kenneth Lay and his charming wife. What's funny about being down to four houses  And I really learned this lesson during the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or  Or as I call them  the good ol' days. When people I knew  you know  people who considered themselves liberal  and everything else  were making fun of Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones. Basically  they were making fun of them for being trailer trash or white trash. It seems  I suppose  a harmless prejudice and that you're not really hurting anybody. Until you read  as I did  an ad in the Los Angeles Times.  For sale  White trash compactor.  So this whole subject object thing has relevance to humor in this way. I read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin  who is the chair of the Classics department at USC. And the book is called  The Garden of Priapus.  And she says that Roman humor mirrors the construction of Roman society. So that Roman society was very top bottom  as ours is to some degree. And so was humor. There always had to be the butt of a joke. So it was always the satirist  like Juvenal or Martial  represented the audience  and he was going to make fun of the outsider  the person who didn't share that subject status. And in stand up of course  the stand up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience. A lot of heckling is the tension of trying to make sure that the comedian is going to be able to dominate  and overcome the heckler. And I got good at that when I was in stand up. But I always hated it because they were dictating the terms of the interaction  in the same way that engaging in a serious argument determines the content  to some degree  of what you're talking about. And I was looking for a form that didn't have that. And so I wanted something that was more interactive. I know that word is so debased now by the use of it by Internet marketers. I really miss the old telemarketers now  I'll tell you that. I do  because at least there you stood a chance. You know  I used to actually hang up on them. But then I read in  Dear Abby  that that was rude. So the next time that one called I let him get halfway through his spiel and then I said   You sound sexy.  He hung up on me  But the interactivity allows the audience to shape what you're going to do as much as you shape their experience of the world. And that's really what I'm looking for. And I was sort of  as I was starting to analyze what exactly it is that I do  I read a book called  Trickster Makes This World   by Lewis Hyde. And it was like being psychoanalyzed. I mean he had laid it all out. And then coming to this conference  I realized that most everybody here shared those same qualities because really what trickster is is an agent of change. Trickster is a change agent. And the qualities that I'm about to describe are the qualities that make it possible to make change happen. And one of these is boundary crossing. I think this is what so  in fact  infuriated the scientists. But I like to cross boundaries. I like to  as I said  talk about things I know nothing about. I hope that's my agent  because you aren't paying me anything. And I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing about because I bring a fresh viewpoint to it  you know  I'm able to see the contradiction that you may not be able to see. Like for instance a mime once    or a meme as he called himself. He was a very selfish meme. And he said that I had to show more respect because it took up to    years to learn how to do mime properly. And I said   Well  that's how you know only stupid people go into it.  It only takes two years to learn how to talk. And you know people  this is the problem with quote  objectivity  unquote. When you're only surrounded by people who speak the same vocabulary as you  or share the same set of assumptions as you  you start to think that that's reality. Like economists  you know  their definition of rational  that we all act out of our own economic self interest. Well  look at Michael Hawley  or look at Dean Kamen  or look at my grandmother. My grandmother always acted in other people's interests  whether they wanted her to or not. If they had had an Olympics in martyrdom  my grandmother would have lost on purpose.  No  you take the prize. You're young. I'm old. Who's going to see it  Where am I going  I'm going to die soon.  So that's one    this boundary crossing  this go between which    Fritz Lanting  is that his name  actually said that he was a go between. That's an actual quality of the trickster. And another is  non oppositional strategies. And this is instead of contradiction. Where you deny the other person's reality  you have paradox where you allow more than one reality to coexist  I think there's another philosophical construction. I'm not sure what it's called. But my example of it is a sign that I saw in a jewelry store. It said   Ears pierced while you wait.  There the alternative just boggles the imagination.  Oh no. Thanks though  I'll leave them here. Thanks very much. I have some errands to run. So I'll be back to pick them up around five  if that's OK with you. Huh  Huh  What  Can't hear you.  And another attribute of the trickster is smart luck. That accidents  that Louis Kahn  who talked about accidents  this is another quality of the trickster. The trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared. That  and I will say this to the scientists  that the trickster has the ability to hold his ideas lightly so that he can let room in for new ideas or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems with his ideas. I had no joke for that. I just wanted to put the scientists in their place. But here's how I think I like to make change  and that is in making connections. This is what I tend to see almost more than contradictions. Like the  what do you call those toes of the gecko  You know  the toes of the gecko  curling and uncurling like the fingers of Michael Moschen. I love connections. Like I'll read that one of the two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe    there are two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe    one is space occupancy. Matter takes up space. I guess the more you matter the more space you take up  which explains the whole SUV phenomenon. And the other one though is impenetrability. Well  in ancient Rome  impenetrability was the criterion of masculinity. Masculinity depended on you being the active penetrator. And then  in economics  there's an active producer and a passive consumer  which explains why business always has to penetrate new markets. Well yeah  I mean why we forced China to open her markets. And didn't that feel good  And now we're being penetrated. You know the biotech companies are actually going inside us and planting their little flags on our genes. You know we're being penetrated. And I suspect  by someone who actively dislikes us. That's the second of the quadruple. Yes of course you got that. Thank you very much. I still have a way to go. And what I hope to do  when I make these connections  is short circuit people's thinking. You know  make you not follow your usual train of association  but make you rewire. It literally    when people say about the shock of recognition  it's literally re cognition  rewiring how you think    I had a joke to go with this and I forgot it. I'm so sorry. I'm getting like the woman in that joke about    have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother  And the mother is elderly. And the mother goes right through a red light. And the daughter doesn't want to say anything. She doesn't want to be like   You're too old to drive.  And the mother goes through a second red light. And the daughter says  as tactfully as possible   Mom  are you aware that you just went through two red lights   And the mother says   Oh  Am I driving   And that's the shock of recognition at the shock of recognition. That completes the quadruple. I just want to say two more things. One is  another characteristic of trickster is that the trickster has to walk this fine line. He has to have poise. And you know the biggest hurdle for me  in doing what I do  is constructing my performance so that it's prepared and unprepared. Finding the balance between those things is always dangerous because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared. But being too prepared doesn't leave room for the accidents to happen. I was thinking about what Moshe Safdie said yesterday about beauty because in his book  Hyde says that sometimes trickster can tip over into beauty. But to do that you have to lose all the other qualities because once you're into beauty you're into a finished thing. You're into something that occupies space and inhabits time. It's an actual thing. And it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty. But if you don't do that  if you allow for the accident to keep on happening  you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength. I like to think of what I do as a probability wave. When you go into beauty the probability wave collapses into one possibility. And I like to explore all the possibilities in the hope that you'll be on the wavelength of your audience. And the one final quality I want to say about trickster is that he doesn't have a home. He's always on the road. I want to say to you Richard  in closing  that in TED you've created a home. And thank you for inviting me into it. Thank you very much. What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things  one  the rise of a culture of availability  and two  a request. So we're seeing a rise of this availability being driven by mobile device proliferation  globally  across all social strata. We're seeing  along with that proliferation of mobile devices  an expectation of availability. And  with that  comes the third point  which is obligation    and an obligation to that availability. And the problem is  we're still working through  from a societal standpoint  how we allow people to be available. There's a significant delta  in fact  between what we're willing to accept. Apologies to Hans Rosling    he said anything that's not using real stats is a lie    but the big delta there is how we deal with this from a public standpoint. So we've developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up. This first one's called  the lean.  And if you've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting  chicken   you're sitting there  looking at the person  waiting for them to look away  and then quickly checking the device. Although you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him.  The stretch.  OK  the gentleman on the left is saying   Screw you  I'm going to check my device.  But the guy  here  on the right  he's doing the stretch. It's that reeeee e e each out  the physical contortion to get that device just below the tabletop. Or  my favorite  the  Love you  mean it.  Nothing says  I love you  like  Let me find somebody else I give a damn about.  Or  this one  coming to us from India. You can find this on YouTube  the gentleman who's recumbent on a motorcycle while text messaging. Or what we call the  sweet gravy  stop me before I kill again   That is actually the device. What this is doing is  we find a    a direct collision    we find a direct collision between availability    and what's possible through availability    and a fundamental human need    which we've been hearing about a lot  actually    the need to create shared narratives. We're very good at creating personal narratives  but it's the shared narratives that make us a culture. And when you're standing with someone  and you're on your mobile device  effectively what you're saying to them is   You are not as important as  literally  almost anything that could come to me through this device.  Look around you. There might be somebody on one right now  participating in multi dimensional engagement. Our reality right now is less interesting than the story we're going to tell about it later. This one I love. This poor kid  clearly a prop    don't get me wrong  a willing prop    but the kiss that's being documented kind of looks like it sucks. This is the sound of one hand clapping. So  as we lose the context of our identity  it becomes incredibly important that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative  becomes the context in which we live. The stories that we tell    what we push out    becomes who we are. People aren't simply projecting identity  they're creating it. And so that's the request I have for everybody in this room. We are creating the technology that is going to create the new shared experience  which will create the new world. And so my request is  please  let's make technologies that make people more human  and not less. Thank you. So how would you run a whole country without oil  That's the question that sort of hit me in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago. It never left my brain. And I started playing with it more like a puzzle. The original thought I had  this must be ethanol. So I went out and researched ethanol  and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country. About six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen  until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth  which is  you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car  if you use hydrogen. So that is not going to be the path to go. And then sort of through a process of wandering around  I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars  in a way that is convenient and affordable  you could get to a solution. Now I started this from a point of view that it has to be something that scales en masse. Not how do you build one car  but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by    percent of the population  The thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today. So one  it has to be more convenient than a car. And two  it has be more affordable than today's cars. Affordable is not a        dollar sedan  right  Alright  That's not something that we can finance or buy today. And convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight. So we're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics. And so the thought that I started with was how do you do this  still within the boundary of the science we know today    no time for science fair  no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up. How do you do it within the economics that we have today  How do you do it from the power of the consumer up  And not from the power of an edict down. On a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon  I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership. In a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic  batteries not included.  Now if you separate between the two  you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network  by creating a network before the cars show up. The network has two components in them. First component is you charge the car whenever you stop    ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours and park for about    hours. If you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute. And so the first thought that came to mind is  everywhere we park we have electric power. Now it sounds crazy. But in some places around the world  like Scandinavia  you already have that. If you park your car and didn't plug in the heater  when you come back you don't have a car. It just doesn't work. Now that last mile  last foot  in a sense  is the first step of the infrastructure. The second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension. See we're bound by today's technology on batteries  which is about     miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and weight limitations.     miles is a good enough range for a lot of people. But you never want to get stuck. So what we added is a second element to our network  which is a battery swap system. You drive. You take your depleted battery out. A full battery comes on. And you drive on. You don't do it as a human being. You do it as a machine. It looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash. And a plate comes up  holds your battery  takes it out  puts it back in  and within two minutes you're back on the road and you can go again. If you had charge spots everywhere  and you had battery swap stations everywhere  how often would you do it  And it ends up that you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station. As a matter of fact  we added to the contract. We said that if you stop to swap your battery more than    times a year we start paying you money because it's an inconvenience. Then we looked at the question of the affordability. We looked at the question  what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car. What is the cost of that battery  Everybody tells us batteries are so expensive. What we found out  when you move from molecules to electrons  something interesting happens. We can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again. The battery is not the gas tank  in a sense. Remember in your car you have a gas tank. You have the crude oil. And you have refining and delivery of that crude oil as what we call petrol or gasoline. The battery in this sense  is the crude oil. We have a battery bay. It costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank. But the crude oil is replaced with a battery. Just it doesn't burn. It consumes itself step after step after step. It has       life cycles these days. And so it's sort of a mini well. We were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well  for the life of the car. Nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car. In a sense what we've done is we've created a new consumable. You  today  buy gasoline miles. And we created electric miles. And the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number. Today       in volume  when we come to market  it is eight cents a mile. Those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means    in the average consumer environment we're in in the U.S.    miles per gallon that's a buck     a buck    a gallon. That's cheaper than today's gasoline  even in the U.S. In Europe where taxes are in place  that's the equivalent to a minus    dollar barrel. But e miles follow Moore's Law. They go from eight cents a mile in       to four cents a mile in       to two cents a mile by     . Why  Because batteries life cycle improve    a bit of improvement on energy density  which reduces the price. And these prices are actually with clean electrons. We do not use any electrons that come from coal. So in a sense this is an absolute zero carbon  zero fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by     . Now even if we get to    miles per gallon by       which is our desire. Imagine only    miles per gallon cars would be on the road. That is an    cent gallon. An    cent gallon means  if the entire Pacific would convert to crude oil  and we'd let any oil company bring it out and refine it  they still can't compete with two cents a mile. That's a new economic factor  which is fascinating to most people. Now this would have been a wonderful paper. That's how I solved it in my head. It was a white paper I handed out to governments. And some governments told me that it's fascinating that the younger generation actually thinks about these things. Until I got to the true young global leader  Shimon Peres  President of Israel  and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me. First he let me go to the prime minister of the country  who told me  if you can find the money you need for this network      million dollars  and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume  in two million cars    that's what we needed in Israel    I'll give you country to invest the     million into. Peres thought that was a great idea. So we went out  and we looked at all the car companies. We sent letters to all the car companies. Three of them never showed up. One of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount. But one of them Carlos Ghosn  CEO of Renault and Nissan  when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating. He said hybrids are like mermaids. When you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish. And Ghosn came up and said   I have the car  Mr. Peres  I will build you the cars.  And actually true to form  Renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume    mass volume being the first year      thousand cars. It's the first mass volume electric car  zero emission electric car in the market. I was running  as Chris said  to be the CEO of a large software company called SAP And then Peres said   Well won't you run this project   And I said   I'm ready for CEO  And he said   Oh no no no no no. You've got to explain to me  what is more important than saving your country and saving the world  that you would go and do   And I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place. We then decided to scale it up. We went to other countries. As I said we went to Denmark. And Denmark set this beautiful policy  it's called the IQ test. It's inversely proportional to taxes. They put     percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on zero emission cars. So if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark  it costs you about        Euros. If you buy our car it's about        Euros. If you fail the IQ test they ask you to leave the country. We then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small islands. I know most people don't think of Israel as a small island  but Israel is an island    it's a transportation island. If your car is driving outside Israel it's been stolen. If you're thinking about it in terms of islands  we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find  and that was Australia. The third country we announced was Australia. It's got three centers    in Brisbane  in Melbourne  in Sydney    and one freeway  one electric freeway that connects them. The next island was not too hard to find  and that was Hawaii. We decided to come into the U.S. and pick the two best places    the one where you didn't need any range extension. Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery. And if you really have a long day you can switch  and keep on driving around the island. The second one was the San Francisco Bay Area where Gavin Newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors. He decided that he's going to take over the state  unofficially  and then officially  and then created this beautiful Region One policy. In the San Francisco Bay Area not only do you have the highest concentration of Priuses  but you also have the perfect range extender. It's called the other car. As we stared scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the U.S.  Why is this a big issue  And the most fascinating thing we've learned is that  when you have small problems on the individual level  like the price of gasoline to drive every morning. You don't notice it  but when the aggregate comes up you're dead. Alright  So the price of oil  much like lots of other curves that we've seen  goes along a depletion curve. The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground. And we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground. It becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out. You think  well it's been up  it's been down  its been up  it's going to keep on going up and down. Here is the problem  at     dollars a barrel  which we were in six months ago  the U.S. spent a ton of money to get oil. Then we lost our economy and we went back down to       sometimes it's     sometimes it's   . Now we're running a stimulus package. It's called the trillion dollar stimulus package. We're going to revive the economy. Hopefully it happens between now and       somewhere in that space. What happens when the economy recovers  By      we would have had at least     million new cars even at the pace we're going at right now. That's another    percent demand on oil. That is another    million barrels a day. That's all the U.S. usage today. In other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak. And then we do the OPEC stimulus package also known as     dollars a barrel. We take our money and we give it away. You know what happens at that point  We go back down. It's going to go up and down. And the downs are going to be much longer and the ups are going to be much shorter. And that's the difference between problems that are additive  like CO   which we go slowly up and then we tip  and problems that are depletive  in which we lose what we have  which oscillate  and they oscillate until we lose everything we've got. Now we actually looked at what the answer would be. Right  Remember in the campaign  one million hybrid cars by     . That is  .  percent of the U.S. oil consumption. That is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world. That won't do much difference. We looked at an MIT study  ten million electric cars on the global roads. Ten million out of     million we will add between now and then. That is the most pessimistic number you can have. It's also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry from     thousand cars is       to    million cars by             x growth in less than five years. You have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars. We have    million cars by region. That's an enormous amount of cars. China is adding those cars    India  Russia  Brazil. We have all these regions. Europe has solved it. They just put a tax on gasoline. They'll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high. China solves it by an edict. At some point they'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city  and that will be it. The Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time. For them to get a battery that goes     miles is an extension on range  not a reduction in range. We're the only ones who don't have the price set right. We don't have the industry set right. We don't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the U.S. Now where is the car industry on that  Very interesting. The car industry has been focused just on themselves. They basically looked at it and said   Car  .  we'll solve everything within the car itself.  No infrastructure  no problem. We forgot about the entire chain around us. All this stuff that happens around. We are looking at the emergence of a car  .     a whole new market  a whole new business model. The business model in which the money that is actually coming in  to drive the car    the minutes  the miles if you want  that you are all familiar with    subsidize the price of the car  just like cellphones. You'll pay for the miles. And some of it will go back to the car maker. Some of it will go back to your own pocket. But our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars. You're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills. In Denmark  we will drive all the cars in Denmark from windmills  not from oil. In Israel  we've asked to put a solar farm in the south of Israel. And people said   Oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for.  And we said   What if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years   And they said   We tried. There isn't any.  We said   No no  but what if we prove it   And they said   Well you can dig.  And we decided to dig up  instead of digging down. These are perfect matches to one another. Now all you need is about    percent of the electricity generated. Think of it as a project that spans over about    years. That's one percent a year. Now when we're looking at solving big problems  we need to start thinking in two numbers. And those are not    percent by     . The two numbers are zero    as in zero footprint or zero oil    and scale it infinity. And when we go to COP   at the end of this year we can't stop thinking of padding CO . We have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale. One car emits four tons. And actually     and change million cars today emit  .  billion tons of CO . That's  in the additive  about    percent of our problem. Cars and trucks add up to about    percent of the world's CO  emissions. We have to come and attack this problem with a focus  with an effort that actually says  we're going to go to zero before the world ends. I actually shared that with some legislators here in the U.S. I shared it with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr.  who is one of my idols. I told him one of the reasons that his uncle was remembered is because he said we're going to send a man to the moon  and we'll do it by the end of the decade. We didn't say we're going to send a man    percent to the moon. And there will be about a    percent chance we'll recover him. He actually shared with me another story  which is from about     years ago.     years ago  in Parliament  in Great Britain  there was a long argument over economy versus morality.    percent    just like    percent emissions today comes from cars       percent of their energy for the entire industrial world in the U.K. came from a source of energy that was immoral  human slaves. And there was an argument. Should we stop using slaves  And what would it do to our economy  And people said   Well we need to take time to do it. Let's not do it immediately. Maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves. And after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery  and the industrial revolution started within less than one year. And the U.K. had     years of economic growth. We have to make the right moral decision. We have to make it immediately. We need to have presidential leadership just like we had in Israel that said we will end oil. And we need to do it not within    years or    years  but within this presidential term because if we don't  we will lose our economy  right after we'd lost our morality. Thank you all very much. The future of life  where the unraveling of our biology    and bring up the lights a little bit. I don't have any slides. I'm just going to talk    about where that's likely to carry us. And you know  I saw all the visions of the first couple of sessions. It almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk about the future. It felt wrong to do that in some way. And yet  I don't really think it is because when it comes down to it  it's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain    what people in the future are going to remember about this period. I want to talk to you a little bit about why the visions of Jeremy Rivkins  who would like to ban these sorts of technologies  or of the Bill Joys who would like to relinquish them  are actually    to follow those paths would be such a tragedy for us. I'm focusing on biology  the biological sciences. The reason I'm doing that is because those are going to be the areas that are the most significant to us. The reason for that is really very simple. It's because we're flesh and blood. We're biological creatures. And what we can do with our biology is going to shape our future and that of our children and that of their children    whether we gain control over aging  whether we learn to protect ourselves from Alzheimer's  and heart disease  and cancer. I think that Shakespeare really put it very nicely. And I'm actually going to use his words in the same order that he did. He said   And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe. And then from hour to hour we rot and rot. And thereby hangs a tale.  Life is short  you know. And we need to think about planning a little bit. We're all going to eventually  even in the developed world  going to have to lose everything that we love. When you're beginning to rot a little bit  all of the videos crammed into your head  all of the extensions that extend your various powers  are going to being to seem a little secondary. And you know  I'm getting a little bit gray    so is Ray Kurzweil  so is Eric Drexler. This is where it's really central to our lives. Now I know there's been a whole lot of hype about our power to control biology. You just have to look at the Human Genome Project. It wasn't two years ago that everybody was talking about    we've found the Holy Grail of biology. We're deciphering the code of codes. We're reading the book of life. It's a little bit reminiscent of      when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon  and everybody was about to race out toward the stars. And we've all seen        A Space Odyssey.  You know it's       and there is no HAL. And there is no odyssey to our own moon  much less the moons of Jupiter. And we're still picking up pieces of the Challenger. So it's not surprising that some people would wonder whether maybe    or    years from now  we'll look back at this instant in time  and all of the sort of talk about the Human Genome Project  and what all this is going to mean to us    well  it will really mean precious little. And I just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case. Because when we talk about our genetics and our biology  and modifying and altering and adjusting these things  we're talking about changing ourselves. And this is very critical stuff. If you have any doubts about how technology affects our lives  you just have to go to any major city. This is not the stomping ground of our Pleistocene ancestors. What's happening is we're taking this technology    it's becoming more precise  more potent    and we're turning it back upon ourselves. Before it's all done we are going to alter ourselves every bit as much as we have changed the world around us. It's going to happen a lot sooner than people imagine. On the way there it's going to completely revolutionize medicine and health care  that's obvious. It's going to change the way we have children. It's going to change the way we manage and alter our emotions. It's going to probably change the human lifespan. It will really make us question what it is to be a human being. The larger context of this is that are two unprecedented revolutions that are going on today. The first of them is the obvious one  the silicon revolution  which you all are very  very familiar with. It's changing our lives in so many ways  and it will continue to do that. What the essence of that is  is that we're taking the sand at our feet  the inert silicon at our feet  and we're breathing a level of complexity into it that rivals that of life itself  and may even surpass it. As an outgrowth of that  as a child of that revolution  is the revolution in biology. The genomics revolution  proteomics  metabolomics  all of these  omics  that sound so terrific on grants and on business plans. What we're doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future. I mean we're essentially using technology to just jam evolution into fast forward. It's not at all clear where it's going to take us. But in five to ten years we're going to start see some very profound changes. The most immediate changes that we'll see are things like in medicine. There is going to be a big shift towards preventative medicine as we start to be able to identify all of the risk factors that we have as individuals. But who is going to pay for all this  And how are we going to understand all this complex information  That is going to be the IT challenge of the next generation  is communicating all this information. There's pharmacogenomics  the combination of pharmacology and genetics  tailoring drugs to our individual constitutions that Juan talked about a little bit earlier. That's going to have amazing impacts. And it's going to be used for diet as well  and nutritional supplements and such. But it's going to have a big impact because we're going to have niche drugs. And we aren't going to be able to support the kinds of expenses that we have to create blockbuster drugs today. The approval process is going to fall apart  actually. It's too slow. It's too risk averse. And it is really not suited for the future that we're moving into. Another thing is that we're just going to have to deal with this knowledge. It's really wonderful when we hear   Oh    .  percent of the letters in the code are the same. We're all identical to each other. Isn't it wonderful   And look around you and know that what we really care about is that little bit of difference. We look the same to a visitor from another planet  maybe  but not to each other because we compete with each other all time. And we're going to have to come to grips with the fact that there are differences between us as individuals that we will know about  and between subpopulations of humans as well. To deny that that's the case is not a very good start on that. A generation or so away there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen. That's when we're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves. Now I don't mean extra gills or something    something we care about  like aging. What if we could unravel aging and understand it    begin to retard the process or even reverse it  It would change absolutely everything. And it's obvious to anyone  that if we can do this  we absolutely will do this  whatever the consequences are. The second is modifying our emotions. I mean Ritalin  Viagra  things of that sort  Prozac. You know  this is just clumsy little baby steps. What if you could take a little concoction of pharmaceuticals that would make you feel really contented  just happy to be you. Are you going to be able to resist that if it doesn't have any overt side effects  Probably not. And if you don't  who are you going to be  Why do you do what you do  We're sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior. It's going to be very challenging to deal with. The third area is reproduction. The idea that we're going to chose our children's genes  as we begin to understand what genes say about who we are. That's the focus of my book  Redesigning Humans   where I talk about the kinds of choices we'll make  and the challenges it's going to present to society. There are three obvious ways of doing this. The first is cloning. It didn't happen. It's a total media circus. It will happen in five to    years. And when it does it's not going to be that big a deal. The birth of a delayed identical twin is not going to shake western civilization. But there are more important things that are already occurring  embryo screening. You take a six to eight cell embryo  you tease out one of the cells  you run a genetic test on that cell  and depending on the results of that test you either implant that embryo or you discard it. It's already done to avoid rare diseases today. And pretty soon it's going to be possible to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way. As that becomes possible this is going to move from something that is used by those who have infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization  to the wealthy who want to protect their children  to just about everybody else. And in that process that's going to morph from being just for diseases  to being for lesser vulnerabilities  like risk of manic depression or something  to picking personalities  temperaments  traits  these sorts of things. Of course there is going to be genetic engineering. Directly going in    it's a little bit further away  but not that far away    going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo. The way I suspect it will happen is using artificial chromosomes and extra chromosomes  so we go from    to    or   . And one that is not heritable because who would want to pass on to their children the archaic enhancement modules that they got    years earlier from their parents  It's a joke  of course they wouldn't want to do that. They'll want the new release. Those kinds of loose analogies with computers  and with programming  are actually much deeper than that. They are really going to come to operate in this realm. Now not everything that can be done should be done. And it won't be done. But when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world  which is going to be the case with these technologies  when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial  which is already the case  and when they're almost impossible to police  it's not a question of if this is going to happen  it's when and where and how it's going to happen. Humanity is going to go down this path. And it's going to do so for two reasons. The first is that all these technologies are just a spin off of mainstream medical research that everybody wants to see happen. It is being funded very very    in a big way. The second is  we're human. That's what we do. We try and use our technology to improve our lives in one way or another. To imagine that we're not going to use these technologies when they become available  is as much a denial of who we are as to imagine that we'll use these technologies and not fret and worry about it a great deal. The lines are going to blur. And they already are between therapy and enhancement  between treatment and prevention  between need and desire. That's really the central one  I believe. People can try and ban these things. They undoubtedly will. They have. But ultimately all this is going to do is just shift development elsewhere. It's going to drive these things from view. It's going to reserve the technology for the wealthy because they are in the best position to circumvent any of these sorts of laws. And it's going to deny us the information that we need to make wise decisions about how to use these technologies. So  sure  we need to debate these things. And I think it's wonderful that we do. But we shouldn't kid ourselves and think that we're going to reach a consensus about these things. That is simply not going to happen. They touch us too deeply. And they depend too much upon history  upon philosophy  upon religion  upon culture  upon politics. Some people are going to see this as an abomination  as the worst thing  as just awful. Other people are going to say   This is great. This is the flowering of human endeavor.  The one thing though that is really dangerous about these sorts of technologies  is that it's easy to become seduced by them. And to focus too much on all the high technology possibilities that exist. And to lose touch with the basic rhythms of our biology and our health. There are too many people that think that high technology medicine is going to keep them  save them  from overeating  from eating a lot of fast foods  from not getting any exercise. It's not going to happen. In the midst of all this amazing technology  and all these things that are occurring  it's really interesting because there is sort of a counter revolution that is going on  a resurgence of interest in remedies from the past  in nutraceuticals  in all of these sorts of things that some people  in the pharmaceutical industry particularly  like to brand as non science. But this whole effort is generated  is driven  by IT as well because that is how we're gathering all this information  and linking it  and integrating it together. There is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well. And that's where about half of our drugs come. So we shouldn't dismiss this because it's an enormous opportunity to use these sorts of results  or these random loose trials from the last thousand years about what has impacts on our health. And to use our advanced technologies to pull out what is beneficial from this sea of noise  basically. In fact this isn't just abstract. I just formed a biotechnology company that is using this sort of an approach to develop therapeutics for Alzheimer's and other diseases of aging  and we're making some real progress. So here we are. It's the beginning of a new millennium. If you look forward  I mean future humans  far before the end of this millennium  in a few hundred years  they are going to look back at this moment. And from the beginning of today's sessions you'd think that they're going to see this as this horrible difficult  painful period that we struggled through. And I don't think that's what's going to happen. They're going to do like everybody does. They are going to forget about all that stuff. And they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time. They are going to think about it as this glorious instant when we laid down the very foundations of their lives  of their society  of their future. You know it's a little bit like a birth. Where there is this bloody  awful mess happens. And then what comes out of it  New life. Actually as was pointed out earlier  we forget about all the struggle there was in getting there. So to me  it's clear that one of the foundations of that future is going to be the reworking of our biology. It's going to come gradually at first. It's going to pick up speed. We're going to make lots of errors. That's the way these things work. To me it's an incredible privilege to be alive now and to be able to witness this thing. It is something that is a unique instant in the history of all of life. It will always be remembered. And what's extraordinary is that we're not just observing this  we are the architects of this. I think that we should be proud of it. What is so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes. It's our health  it's our lives  it's our future  it's our children. And that is why they are so very troubling to so many people who would pull back in fear. I think that our choice in the choice of life  is not whether we're going to go down this path. We are  definitely. It's how we hold it in our hearts. It's how we look at it. I think Thucydides really spoke to us very clearly in     B.C. He put it nicely. Again  I'll use the words in the same order he did.  The bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them  both glory and danger alike. And yet notwithstanding  they go out and they meet it.  Thank you. The AlloSphere  it's a three story metal sphere in an echo free chamber. Think of the AlloSphere as a large  dynamically varying digital microscope that's connected to a supercomputer.    researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere  and be completely immersed in their data. Imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin. Imagine if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material. Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain  as though it was a world  and see tissues as landscapes  and hear blood density levels as music. This is some of the research that you're going to see that we're undertaking at the AlloSphere. But first a little bit about this group of artists  scientists  and engineers that are working together. I'm a composer  orchestrally trained  and the inventor of the AlloSphere. With my visual artist colleagues  we map complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space  visually and sonically. Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information. And our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration. I'm going to fly you into five research projects in the AlloSphere that are going to take you from biological macroscopic data all the way down to electron spin. This first project is called the AlloBrain. And it's our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful. You're flying through the cortex of my colleague's brain. Our narrative here is real fMRI data that's mapped visually and sonically. The brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with. You see    intelligent computer agents  the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you. They're mining blood density levels. And they're reporting them back to you sonically. Higher density levels mean more activity in that point of the brain. They're actually singing these densities to you with higher pitches mapped to higher densities. We're now going to move from real biological data to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature in our next artistic and scientific installation. In this artistic and scientific installation  biogenerative algorithms are helping us to understand self generation and growth  very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences. For artists  we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore. These generative algorithms grow over time  and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects. Our researchers are interacting with this data by injecting bacterial code  which are computer programs  that allow these creatures to grow over time. We're going to move now from the biological and the macroscopic world  down into the atomic world  as we fly into a lattice of atoms. This is real AFM    Atomic Force Microscope    data from my colleagues in the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center. They've discovered a new bond  a new material for transparent solar cells. We're flying through       lattice of atoms    oxygen  hydrogen and zinc. You view the bond in the triangle. It's four blue zinc atoms bonding with one white hydrogen atom. You see the electron flow with the streamlines we as artists have generated for the scientists. This is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms. We think it makes a beautiful structural art. The sound that you're hearing are the actual emission spectrums of these atoms. We've mapped them into the audio domain  so they're singing to you. Oxygen  hydrogen and zinc have their own signature. We're going to actually move even further down as we go from this lattice of atoms to one single hydrogen atom. We're working with our physicist colleagues that have given us the mathematical calculations of the n dimensional Schr dinger equation in time. What you're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom. You're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines. The white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three orbital configuration. In a minute we're going to move to a two orbital configuration  and you're going to notice a pulsing. And you're going to hear an undulation between the sound. This is actually a light emitter. As the sound starts to pulse and contract  our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted. They're starting to find new mathematical structures in these calculations. And they're understanding more about quantum mathematics. We're going to move even further down  and go to one single electron spin. This will be the final project that I show you. Our colleagues in the Center for Quantum Computation and Spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers decoherence in a single electron spin. We've taken this information and we've made a mathematical model out of it. You're actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow. This is very important for the next step in simulating quantum computers and information technology. So these brief examples that I've shown you give you an idea of the kind of work that we're doing at the University of California  Santa Barbara  to bring together  arts  science and engineering into a new age of math  science and art. We hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere. Inspire us to think of new ways that we can use this unique instrument that we've created at Santa Barbara. Thank you very much. This is Tim Ferriss circa      A.D. Age two. You can tell by the power squat  I was a very confident boy    and not without reason. I had a very charming routine at the time  which was to wait until late in the evening when my parents were decompressing from a hard day's work  doing their crossword puzzles  watching television. I would run into the living room  jump up on the couch  rip the cushions off  throw them on the floor  scream at the top of my lungs and run out because I was the Incredible Hulk. Obviously  you see the resemblance. And this routine went on for some time. When I was seven I went to summer camp. My parents found it necessary for peace of mind. And at noon each day the campers would go to a pond  where they had floating docks. You could jump off the end into the deep end. I was born premature. I was always very small. My left lung had collapsed when I was born. And I've always had buoyancy problems. So water was something that scared me to begin with. But I would go in on occasion. And on one particular day  the campers were jumping through inner tubes  They were diving through inner tubes. And I thought this would be great fun. So I dove through the inner tube  and the bully of the camp grabbed my ankles. And I tried to come up for air  and my lower back hit the bottom of the inner tube. And I went wild eyed and thought I was going to die. A camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us. From that point onward I was terrified of swimming. That is something that I did not get over. My inability to swim has been one of my greatest humiliations and embarrassments. That is when I realized that I was not the Incredible Hulk. But there is a happy ending to this story. At age       that's my age now    in August I took two weeks to re examine swimming  and question all the of the obvious aspects of swimming. And went from swimming one lap    so    yards    like a drowning monkey  at about     beats per minute heart rate    I measured it    to going to Montauk on Long Island  close to where I grew up  and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water  getting out and feeling better than when I went in. And I came out  in my Speedos  European style  feeling like the Incredible Hulk. And that's what I want everyone in here to feel like  the Incredible Hulk  at the end of this presentation. More specifically  I want you to feel like you're capable of becoming an excellent long distance swimmer  a world class language learner  and a tango champion. And I would like to share my art. If I have an art  it's deconstructing things that really scare the living hell out of me. So  moving onward. Swimming  first principles. First principles  this is very important. I find that the best results in life are often held back by false constructs and untested assumptions. And the turnaround in swimming came when a friend of mine said   I will go a year without any stimulants     this is a six double espresso per day type of guy     if you can complete a one kilometer open water race.  So the clock started ticking. I started seeking out triathletes because I found that lifelong swimmers often couldn't teach what they did. I tried kickboards. My feet would slice through the water like razors  I wouldn't even move. I would leave demoralized  staring at my feet. Hand paddles  everything. Even did lessons with Olympians    nothing helped. And then Chris Sacca  who is now a dear friend mine  had completed an Iron Man with     degree temperature  said   I have the answer to your prayers.  And he introduced me to the work of a man named Terry Laughlin who is the founder of Total Immersion Swimming. That set me on the road to examining biomechanics. So here are the new rules of swimming  if any of you are afraid of swimming  or not good at it. The first is  forget about kicking. Very counterintuitive. So it turns out that propulsion isn't really the problem. Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent of their energy expenditure into forward motion. The problem is hydrodynamics. So what you want to focus on instead is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body  much like a small car behind a big car on the highway. And you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position. The only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water. The body is denser than water.    percent of it would be  at least  submerged naturally. So you end up  number three  not swimming  in the case of freestyle  on your stomach  as many people think  reaching on top of the water. But actually rotating from streamlined right to streamlined left  maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible. So let's look at some examples. This is Terry. And you can see that he's extending his right arm below his head and far in front. And so his entire body really is underwater. The arm is extended below the head. The head is held in line with the spine  so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up    very important  especially for people with lower body fat. Here is an example of the stroke. So you don't kick. But you do use a small flick. You can see this is the left extension. Then you see his left leg. Small flick  and the only purpose of that is to rotate his hips so he can get to the opposite side. And the entry point for his right hand    notice this  he's not reaching in front and catching the water. Rather  he is entering the water at a    degree angle with his forearm  and then propelling himself by streamlining    very important. Incorrect  above  which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you. Not their fault  honestly. And I'll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment. Below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what I did  which is going from    strokes per    yard length to    strokes in two workouts with no coach  no video monitoring. And now I love swimming. I can't wait to go swimming. I'll be doing a swimming lesson later  for myself  if anyone wants to join me. Last thing  breathing. A problem a lot of us have  certainly  when you're swimming. In freestyle  easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll  and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water. And that will get you very far. That's it. That's really all you need to know. Languages. Material versus method. I  like many people  came to the conclusion that I was terrible at languages. I suffered through Spanish for junior high  first year of high school  and the sum total of my knowledge was pretty much   Donde esta el bano   And I wouldn't even catch the response. A sad state of affairs. Then I transferred to a different school sophomore year  and I had a choice of other languages. Most of my friends were taking Japanese. So I thought why not punish myself  I'll do Japanese. Six months later I had the chance to go to Japan. My teachers assured me  they said   Don't worry. You'll have Japanese language classes every day to help you cope. It will be an amazing experience.  My first overseas experience in fact. So my parents encouraged me to do it. I left. I arrived in Tokyo. Amazing. I couldn't believe I was on the other side of the world. I met my host family. Things went quite well I think  all things considered. My first evening  before my first day of school  I said to my mother  very politely   Please wake me up at eight a.m.  So   Japanese  But I didn't say  Japanese . I said   Japanese . Pretty close. But I said   Please rape me at eight a.m.  You've never seen a more confused Japanese woman. I walked in to school. And a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper. I couldn't read any of it    hieroglyphics  it could have been    because it was Kanji  Chinese characters adapted into the Japanese language. Asked him what this said. And he goes   Ahh  okay okay  eehto  World History  ehh  Calculus  Traditional Japanese.  And so on. And so it came to me in waves. There had been something lost in translation. The Japanese classes were not Japanese instruction classes  per se. They were the normal high school curriculum for Japanese students    the other       students in the school  who were Japanese  besides the American. And that's pretty much my response. And that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method. I tried everything. I went to Kinokuniya. I tried every possible book  every possible CD. Nothing worked until I found this. This is the Joyo Kanji. This is a Tablet rather  or a poster of the       common use characters as determined by the Ministry of Education in     . Many of the publications in Japan limit themselves to these characters  to facilitate literacy    some are required to. And this became my Holy Grail  my Rosetta Stone. As soon as I focused on this material  I took off. I ended up being able to read Asahi Shinbu  Asahi newspaper  about six months later    so a total of    months later    and went from Japanese I to Japanese VI. Ended up doing translation work at age    when I returned to the U.S.  and have continued to apply this material over method approach to close to a dozen languages now. Someone who was terrible at languages  and at any given time  speak  read and write five or six. This brings us to the point  which is  it's oftentimes what you do  not how you do it  that is the determining factor. This is the difference between being effective    doing the right things    and being efficient    doing things well whether or not they're important. You can also do this with grammar. I came up with these six sentences after much experimentation. Having a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar  by translating these sentences into past  present  future  will show you subject  object  verb  placement of indirect  direct objects  gender and so forth. From that point  you can then  if you want to  acquire multiple languages  alternate them so there is no interference. We can talk about that if anyone in interested. And now I love languages. So ballroom dancing  implicit versus explicit    very important. You might look at me and say   That guy must be a ballroom dancer.  But no  you'd be wrong because my body is very poorly designed for most things    pretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps. I used to be much bigger  much more muscular. And so I ended up walking like this. I looked a lot like an orangutan  our close cousins  or the Incredible Hulk. Not very good for ballroom dancing. I found myself in Argentina in       decided to watch a tango class    had no intention of participating. Went in  paid my ten pesos  walked up       women two guys  usually a good ratio. The instructor says   You are participating.  Immediately  death sweat. Fight or flight fear sweat  because I tried ballroom dancing in college    stepped on the girl's foot with my heel. She screamed. I was so concerned with her perception of what I was doing  that it exploded in my face  never to return to the ballroom dancing club. She comes up  and this was her approach  the teacher.  Okay  come on  grab me.  Gorgeous assistant instructor. She was very pissed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice. So I did my best. I didn't know where to put my hands. And she pulled back  threw down her arms  put them on her hips  turned around and yelled across the room   This guy is built like a god damned mountain of muscle  and he's grabbing me like a fucking Frenchman   which I found encouraging. Everyone burst into laughter. I was humiliated. She came back. She goes   Come on. I don't have all day.  As someone who wrestled since age eight  I proceeded to crush her   Of Mice and Men  style. And she looked up and said   Now that's better.  So I bought a month's worth of classes. And proceeded to look at    I wanted to set competition so I'd have a deadline    Parkinson's Law  the perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it. So I had a very short deadline for a competition. I got a female instructor first  to teach me the female role  the follow  because I wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities that the follow needed to develop  so I wouldn't have a repeat of college. And then I took an inventory of the characteristics  along with her  of the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who'd won championships. I interviewed these people because they all taught in Buenos Aires. I compared the two lists  and what you find is that there is explicitly  expertise they recommended  certain training methods. Then there were implicit commonalities that none of them seemed to be practicing. Now the protectionism of Argentine dance teachers aside  I found this very interesting. So I decided to focus on three of those commonalities. Long steps. So a lot of milongueros    the tango dancers will use very short steps. I found that longer steps were much more elegant. So you can have    and you can do it in a very small space in fact. Secondly  different types of pivots. Thirdly  variation in tempo. These seemed to be the three areas that I could exploit to compete if I wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for    to    years. That photo is of the semi finals of the Buenos Aires championships  four months later. Then one month later  went to the world championships  made it to the semi final. And then set a world record  following that  two weeks later. I want you to see part of what I practiced. I'm going to jump forward here. This is the instructor that Alicia and I chose for the male lead. His name is Gabriel Misse. One of the most elegant dancers of his generation  known for his long steps  and his tempo changes and his pivots. Alicia  in her own right  very famous. So I think you'll agree  they look quite good together. Now what I like about this video is it's actually a video of the first time they ever danced together because of his lead. He had a strong lead. He didn't lead with his chest  which requires you lean forward. I couldn't develop the attributes in my toes  the strength in my feet  to do that. So he uses a lead that focuses on his shoulder girdle and his arm. So he can lift the woman to break her  for example. That's just one benefit of that. So then we broke it down. This would be an example of one pivot. This is a back step pivot. There are many different types. I have hundreds of hours of footage    all categorized  much like George Carlin categorized his comedy. So using my arch nemesis  Spanish  no less  to learn tango. So fear is your friend. Fear is an indicator. Sometimes it shows you what you shouldn't do. More often than not it shows you exactly what you should do. And the best results that I've had in life  the most enjoyable times  have all been from asking a simple question  what's the worst that can happen  Especially with fears you gained when you were a child. Take the analytical frameworks  the capabilities you have  apply them to old fears. Apply them to very big dreams. And when I think of what I fear now  it's very simple. When I imagine my life  what my life would have been like without the educational opportunities that I had  it makes me wonder. I've spent the last two years trying to deconstruct the American public school system  to either fix it or replace it. And have done experiments with about        students thus far    built  I'd say  about a half dozen schools  my readers  at this point. And if any of you are interested in that  I would love to speak with you. I know nothing. I'm a beginner. But I ask a lot of questions  and I would love your advice. Thank you very much. It's pretty simple. There are nine  sort of  rules that I discovered after    years of rock climbing. Most of them are pretty basic. Number one  don't let go    very sure success method. But really  truly    often you think about letting go way before your body does. So hang in there  and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions. Number two  hesitation is bad. This is a friction climb  up in Tuolumne Meadows  in the Yosemite high country. Friction climbing doesn't have any sort of hard positive edges. You're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock. The most friction you have is when you first put your hand or your foot on the rock. And then from that point on  you're basically falling. So momentum is good. Don't stop. Rule number three  have a plan. This is a climb called the Naked Edge  in El Dorado Canyon  outside of Boulder. This climber is on the last pitch of it. He's actually right about where I fell. There is about       feet of air below him. And all the hard pitches are actually below him. Often what happens is you're planning so hard for like   How do I get through the hardest part  How do I get through the hardest part   And then what happens  You get to the last pitch. It's easy. And you're completely flamed out. Don't do it. You have to plan ahead to get to the top. But you also can't forget that each individual move you have to be able to complete. This is a climb called the Dike Route  on Pywjack Dome  up in the Yosemite high country. The interesting thing about this climb is it's not that hard. But if you're the leader on it  at the hardest move  you're looking at about     foot fall  onto some low angle slabs. So you've got to focus. You don't want to stop in the middle like Coleridge's Kubla Kahn. You've got to keep going. Rule number five  know how to rest. It's amazing. The best climbers are the ones that in the most extreme situations can get their bodies into some position where they can rest  regroup  calm themselves  focus  and keep going. This is a climb in the Needles  again in California. Fear really sucks because what it means is you're not focusing on what you're doing. You're focusing on the consequences of failing at what you're doing because any given move should require all your concentration and thought processes to execute it effectively. One of the things in climbing is  most people sort of take it straight on. And they follow the most obvious solution. This is the Devils Tower in Wyoming  which is a columnar basalt formation that most of you probably know from  Close Encounters.  With this  typically crack climbers would put their hands in and their toes in and just start climbing. The cracks are too small to get your toes into so the only way to climb is using your fingertips in the cracks  and using opposing pressure and forcing yourself up. Rule number eight  strength doesn't always equal success. In the    years I've been a climbing guide and taught on indoor walls  and stuff like that  the most important thing I've learned was  guys will always try to do pull ups. Beginning guys  it's like  they thrash  they thrash  they get    feet up    and they can do about    pull ups right    And then they just flame out. Women are much more in balance because they don't have that idea that they're going to be able to do     pull ups. They think about how to get the weight over their feet because it's sort of natural    they carry you all day long. So balance is really critical  and keeping your weight on your feet  which is your strongest muscle. And of course there is rule number nine. I came up with rule number nine after I actually didn't plan for a fall  and went about    feet and cracked a rib. Once you get to that point where you know it's going to happen  you need to start thinking about how you're going to let go because that is the critical piece of not getting hurt    how you're going to fall onto the rope  or if you're climbing without a rope  fall to a place where you can actually control the fall. So don't hang on till the bitter end. Thank you very much. I'm here today  as June said  to talk about a project that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years. We're crocheting a coral reef. And it's a project that we've actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world  who are doing it with us. Indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project  in many of its different aspects. It's a project that now reaches across three continents  and its roots go into the fields of mathematics  marine biology  feminine handicraft and environmental activism. It's true. It's also a project that in a very beautiful way  the development of this has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth  which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying right here in February         which  as one of our previous speakers told us  is the    th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin. All of this I'm going to get to in the next    minutes  I hope. But let me first begin by showing you some pictures of what this thing looks like. Just to give you an idea of scale  that installation there is about six feet across  and the tallest models are about two or three feet high. This is some more images of it. That one on the right is about five feet high. The work involves hundreds of different crochet models. And indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people have contributed all over the world as part of this. The totality of this project involves tens of thousands of hours of human labor       percent of it done by women. On the right hand side  that bit there is part of an installation that is about    feet long. My sister and I started this project in      because in that year  at least in the science press  there was a lot of talk about global warming  and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs. Corals are very delicate organisms  and they are devastated by any rise in sea temperatures. It causes these vast bleaching events that are the first signs of corals of being sick. And if the bleaching doesn't go away    if the temperatures don't go down    reefs start to die. A great deal of this has been happening in the Great Barrier Reef  particularly in coral reefs all over the world. This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef. We have a new organization together called The Institute for Figuring  which is a little organization we started to promote  to do projects about the aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics. And I went and put a little announcement up on our site  asking for people to join us in this enterprise. To our surprise  one of the first people who called was the Andy Warhol Museum. And they said they were having an exhibition about artists' response to global warming  and they'd like our coral reef to be part of it. I laughed and said   Well we've only just started it  you can have a little bit of it.  So in      we had an exhibition  a small exhibition of this crochet reef. And then some people in Chicago came along and they said   In late       the theme of the Chicago Humanities Festival is global warming. And we've got this       square foot gallery and we want you to fill it with your reef.  And I  naively by this stage  said   Oh  yes  sure.  Now I say  naively  because actually my profession is as a science writer. What I do is I write books about the cultural history of physics. I've written books about the history of space  the history of physics and religion  and I write articles for people like the New York Times and the L.A. Times. So I had no idea what it meant to fill a       square foot gallery. So I said yes to this proposition. And I went home  and I told my sister Christine. And she nearly had a fit because Christine is a professor at one of L.A.'s major art colleges  CalArts  and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a       square foot gallery. She thought I'd gone off my head. But she went into crochet overdrive. And to cut a long story short  eight months later we did fill the Chicago Cultural Center's       square foot gallery. By this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own  which got completely beyond us. The people in Chicago decided that as well as exhibiting our reefs  what they wanted to do was have the local people there make a reef. So we went and taught the techniques. We did workshops and lectures. And the people in Chicago made a reef of their own. And it was exhibited alongside ours. There were hundreds of people involved in that. We got invited to do the whole thing in New York  and in London  and in Los Angeles. In each of these cities  the local citizens  hundreds and hundreds of them  have made a reef. And more and more people get involved in this  most of whom we've never met. So the whole thing has sort of morphed into this organic  ever evolving creature  that's actually gone way beyond Christine and I. Now some of you are sitting here thinking   What planet are these people on  Why on earth are you crocheting a reef  Woolenness and wetness aren't exactly two concepts that go together. Why not chisel a coral reef out of marble  Cast it in bronze.  But it turns out there is a very good reason why we are crocheting it because many organisms in coral reefs have a very particular kind of structure. The frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals  and kelps  and sponges and nudibranchs  is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry. And the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet. It happens to be a fact. It's almost impossible to model this structure any other way  and it's almost impossible to do it on computers. So what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs embody  The next few minutes is  we're all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug. This sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics when it was first discovered in the   th century. But not until      did mathematicians actually understand how they could model it. In      a mathematician at Cornell  Daina Taimina  made the discovery that this structure could actually be done in knitting and crochet. The first one she did was knitting. But you get too many stitches on the needle. So she quickly realized crochet was the better thing. But what she was doing was actually making a model of a mathematical structure  that many mathematicians had thought it was actually impossible to model. And indeed they thought that anything like this structure was impossible per se. Some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years trying to prove that this structure was impossible. So what is this impossible hyperbolic structure  Before hyperbolic geometry  mathematicians knew about two kinds of space  Euclidean space  and spherical space. And they have different properties. Mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist. You all have a sense of what a flat space is  Euclidean space is. But mathematicians formalize this in a particular way. And what they do is  they do it through the concept of parallel lines. So here we have a line and a point outside the line. And Euclid said   How can I define parallel lines  I ask the question  how many lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line   And you all know the answer. Does someone want to shout it out  One. Great. Okay. That's our definition of a parallel line. It's a definition really of Euclidean space. But there is another possibility that you all know of  spherical space. Think of the surface of a sphere    just like a beach ball  the surface of the Earth. I have a straight line on my spherical surface. And I have a point outside the line. How many straight lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line  What do we mean to talk about a straight line on a curved surface  Now mathematicians have answered that question. They've understood there is a generalized concept of straightness  it's called a geodesic. And on the surface of a sphere  a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw. So it's like the equator or the lines of longitude. So we ask the question again   How many straight lines can I draw through the point  but never meet the original line   Does someone want to guess  Zero. Very good. Now mathematicians thought that was the only alternative. It's a bit suspicious isn't it  There is two answers to the question so far  Zero and one. Two answers  There may possibly be a third alternative. To a mathematician if there are two answers  and the first two are zero and one  there is another number that immediately suggests itself as the third alternative. Does anyone want to guess what it is  Infinity. You all got it right. Exactly. There is  there's a third alternative. This is what it looks like. There's a straight line  and there is an infinite number of lines that go through the point and never meet the original line. This is the drawing. This nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because  like you  they're sitting there feeling bamboozled. Thinking  how can that be  You're cheating. The lines are curved. But that's only because I'm projecting it onto a flat surface. Mathematicians for several hundred years had to really struggle with this. How could they see this  What did it mean to actually have a physical model that looked like this  It's a bit like this  imagine that we'd only ever encountered Euclidean space. Then our mathematicians come along and said   There's this thing called a sphere  and the lines come together at the north and south pole.  But you don't know what a sphere looks like. And someone that comes along and says   Look here's a ball.  And you go   Ah  I can see it. I can feel it. I can touch it. I can play with it.  And that's exactly what happened when Daina Taimina in       showed that you could crochet models in hyperbolic space. Here is this diagram in crochetness. I've stitched Euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface. And the lines look curved. But look  I can prove to you that they're straight because I can take any one of these lines  and I can fold along it. And it's a straight line. So here  in wool  through a domestic feminine art  is the proof that the most famous postulate in mathematics is wrong. And you can stitch all sorts of mathematical theorems onto these surfaces. The discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics that is called non Euclidean geometry. And this is actually the field of mathematics that underlies general relativity and is actually ultimately going to show us about the shape of the universe. So there is this direct line between feminine handicraft  Euclid and general relativity. Now  I said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible. Here's two creatures who've never heard of Euclid's parallel postulate    didn't know it was impossible to violate  and they're simply getting on with it. They've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years. I once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the Silurian age. Their answer was interesting. They said   Well I guess there aren't that many mathematicians sitting around looking at sea slugs.  And that's true. But it also goes deeper than that. It also says a whole lot of things about what mathematicians thought mathematics was  what they thought it could and couldn't do  what they thought it could and couldn't represent. Even mathematicians  who in some sense are the freest of all thinkers  literally couldn't see not only the sea slugs around them  but the lettuce on their plate    because lettuces  and all those curly vegetables  they also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry. And so in some sense they literally  they had such a symbolic view of mathematics  they couldn't actually see what was going on on the lettuce in front of them. It turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders. And so  too  we've discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures. We started out  Chrissy and I and our contributors  doing the simple mathematically perfect models. But we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it    the simple algorithm crochet three  increase one    when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code  the models immediately started to look more natural. And all of our contributors  who are an amazing collection of people around the world  do their own embellishments. As it were  we have this ever evolving  crochet taxonomic tree of life. Just as the morphology and the complexity of life on earth is never ending  little embellishments and complexifications in the DNA code lead to new things like giraffes  or orchids    so too  do little embellishments in the crochet code lead to new and wondrous creatures in the evolutionary tree of crochet life. So this project really has taken on this inner organic life of its own. There is the totality of all the people who have come to it. And their individual visions  and their engagement with this mathematical mode. We have these technologies. We use them. But why  What's at stake here  What does it matter  For Chrissy and I  one of the things that's important here is that these things suggest the importance and value of embodied knowledge. We live in a society that completely tends to valorize symbolic forms of representation    algebraic representations  equations  codes. We live in a society that's obsessed with presenting information in this way  teaching information in this way. But through this sort of modality  crochet  other plastic forms of play    people can be engaged with the most abstract  high powered  theoretical ideas  the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go to university departments to study in higher mathematics  which is where I first learned about hyperbolic space. But you can do it through playing with material objects. One of the ways that we've come to think about this is that what we're trying to do with the Institute for Figuring and projects like this  we're trying to have kindergarten for grown ups. And kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education  established by a man named Friedrich Froebel  who was a crystallographer in the   th century. He believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation. He developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play. And he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right. The value of education is something that Froebel championed  through plastic modes of play. We live in a society now where we have lots of think tanks  where great minds go to think about the world. They write these great symbolic treatises called books  and papers  and op ed articles. We want to propose  Chrissy and I  through The Institute for Figuring  another alternative way of doing things  which is the play tank. And the play tank  like the think tank  is a place where people can go and engage with great ideas. But what we want to propose  is that the highest levels of abstraction  things like mathematics  computing  logic  etc.    all of this can be engaged with  not just through purely cerebral algebraic symbolic methods  but by literally  physically playing with ideas. Thank you very much. When I was five years old I fell in love with airplanes. Now I'm talking about the '  s. In the '  s an airplane had two wings and a round motor  and was always flown by a guy who looked like Cary Grant. He had high leather boots  jodhpurs  an old leather jacket  a wonderful helmet and those marvelous goggles    and  inevitably  a white scarf  to flow in the wind. He'd always walk up to his airplane in a kind of saunter  devil may care saunter  flick the cigarette away  grab the girl waiting here  give her a kiss. And then mount his airplane  maybe for the last time. Of course I always wondered what would happen if he'd kissed the airplane first. But this was real romance to me. Everything about flying in those years  which was    you have to stop and think for a moment    was probably the most advanced technological thing going on at the time. So as a youngster  I tried to get close to this by drawing airplanes  constantly drawing airplanes. It's the way I got a part of this romance. And of course  in a way  when I say romance  I mean in part the aesthetics of that whole situation. I think the word is the holistic experience revolving around a product. The product was that airplane. But it built a romance. Even the parts of the airplane had French names. Ze fuselage  ze empanage  ze nessal. You know  from a romance language. So that it was something that just got into your spirit. It did mine. And I decided I had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes. I wanted to build airplanes. So I built model airplanes. And I found that in doing the model airplanes the appearance drawings were not enough. You couldn't transfer those to the model itself. If you wanted it to fly you had to learn the discipline of flying. You had to learn about aeronautics. You had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air. And of course  as a model in those years  you couldn't control it. So it had to be self righting  and stay up without crashing. So I had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes and convert it to technical drawings    the shape of the wing  the shape of the fuselage and so on    and build an airplane over these drawings that I knew followed some of the principles of flying. And in so doing  I could produce a model that would fly  stay in the air. And it had  once it was in the air  some of this romance that I was in love with. Well the act of drawing airplanes led me to  when I had the opportunity to choose a course in school  led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering. And when I was sitting in classes    in which no one asked me to draw an airplane    to my surprise. I had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing. I'd wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class. One day a young man looked over my shoulder  he said   You draw very well. You should be in the art department.  And I said   Why   And he said   Well for one thing  there are more girls there.  So my romance was temporarily shifted. And I went into art because they appreciated drawing. Studied painting  didn't do very well at that. Went through design  some architecture. Eventually hired myself out as a designer. And for the following    years  living in Italy  living in America  I doled out a piece of this romance to anybody who'd pay for it    this sense  this aesthetic feeling  for the experience revolving around a designed object. And it exists. Any of you who rode the automobiles    was it yesterday     at the track  you know the romance revolving around those high performance cars. Well in    years I was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call doesn't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature. So after    years I began to feel as though I was running dry. And I quit. And I started up a very small operation    went from    people to one  in an effort to rediscover my innocence. I wanted to get back where the romance was. And I couldn't choose airplanes because they had gotten sort of unromantic at that point  even though I'd done a lot of airplane work  on the interiors. So I chose furniture. And I chose chairs specifically because I knew something about them. I'd designed a lot of chairs  over the years for tractors and trucks and submarines    all kinds of things. But not office chairs. So I started doing that. And I found that there were ways to duplicate the same approach that I used to use on the airplane. Only this time  instead of the product being shaped by the wind  it was shaped by the human body. So the discipline was    as in the airplane you learn a lot about how to deal with the air  for a chair you have to learn a lot about how to deal with the body  and what the body needs  wants  indicates it needs. And that's the way  ultimately after some ups and downs  I ended up designing the chair I'm going to show you. I should say one more thing. When I was doing those model airplanes  I did everything. I conceived the kind of airplane. I basically engineered it. I built it. And I flew it. And that's the way I work now. When I started this chair it was not a preconceived notion. Design nowadays  if you mean it  you don't start with styling sketches. I started with a lot of loose ideas  roughly eight or nine years ago. And the loose ideas had something to do with what I knew happened with people in the office  at the work place    people who worked  and used task seating  a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long. And I felt  the one thing they don't need  is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there. So I took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn't have to fuss with it. So my idea was that  instead of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls  that you would sit on the chair  and it would automatically balance your weight against the force required to recline. Now that may not mean a lot to some of you. But you know most good chairs do recline because it's beneficial to open up this joint between your legs and your upper body for better breathing and better flow. So that if you sit down on my chair  whether you're five feet tall or six foot six  it always deals with your weight and transfers the amount of force required to recline in a way that you don't have to look for something to adjust. I'll tell you right up front  this is a trade off. There are drawbacks to this. One is  you can't accommodate everybody. There are some very light people  some extremely heavy people  maybe people with a lot of bulk up top. They begin to fall off the end of your chart. But the compromise  I felt  was in my favor because most people don't adjust their chairs. They will sit in them forever. I had somebody on the bus out to the racetrack tell me about his sister calling him. He said she had one of the new  better chairs. She said   Oh I love it.  She said   But it's too high.  So he said   Well I'll come over and look at it.  He came over and looked at it. He reached down. He pulled a lever. And the chair sank down. She said   Oh it's wonderful. How did you do that   And he showed her the lever. Well  that's typical of a lot of us working in chairs. And why should you get a    page manual about how to run a chair  I had one for a wristwatch once.    pages. Anyway  I felt that it was important that you didn't have to make an adjustment in order to get this kind of action. The other thing I felt was that armrests had never really been properly approached from the standpoint of how much of an aid they could be to your work life. But I felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual armrest in order to get it where you wanted. So I spent a long time. I said I worked eight or nine years on it. And each of these things went along sort of in parallel but incrementally were a problem of their own. I worked a long time on figuring out how to move the arms over a much greater arc    that is up and down    and make them a lot easier  so that you didn't have to use a button. And so after many trials  many failures  we came up with a very simple arrangement in which we could just move one arm or the other. And they go up easily. And stop where you want. You can put them down  essentially out of the way. No arms at all. Or you can pull them up where you want them. And this was another thing that I felt  while not nearly as romantic as Cary Grant  nevertheless begins to grab a little bit of aesthetic operation  aesthetic performance into a product. The next area that was of interest to me was the fact that reclining was a very important factor. And the more you can recline  in a way  the better it is. The more the angle between here and here opens up    and nowadays  with a screen in front of you  you don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline  so we keep it at more or less the same level    but you transfer weight off your tailbones. Would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone  You feel that bone under there  Just your own. There's two of them  one on either side. All the weight of your upper torso    your arms  your head    goes right down through your back  your spine  into those bones when you sit. And that's a lot of load. Just relieving your arms with armrests takes    percent of that load off. Now that  if your spine is not held in a good position  will help bend your spine the wrong way  and so on. So to unload that great weight    if that indeed exists    you can recline. When you recline you take away a lot of that load off your bottom end  and transfer it to your back. At the same time  as I say  you open up this joint. And breathability is good. But to do that  if you have any amount of recline  it gets to the point where you need a headrest because nearly always  automatically hold your head in a vertical position  see  As I recline  my head says more or less vertical. Well if you're reclined a great deal  you have to use muscle force to hold your head there. So that's where a headrest comes in. Now headrest is a challenge because you want it to adjust enough so that it'll fit  you know  a tall guy and a short girl. So here we are. I've got five inches of adjustment here in order to get the headrest in the right place. But then I knew from experience and looking around in offices where there were chairs with headrests that nobody would ever bother to reach back and turn a knob and adjust the headrest to put it in position. And you need it in a different position when you're upright  then when you're reclined. So I knew that had to be solved  and had to be automatic. So if you watch this chair as I recline  the headrest comes up to meet my neck. Ideally you want to put the head support in the cranial area  right there. So that part of it took a long time to work out. And there is a variety of other things  the shape of the cushions  the gel we put. We stole the idea from bicycle seats  and put gel in the cushions and in the armrests to absorb point load    distributes the loading so you don't get hard spots. You cant hit your elbow on bottom. And I did want to demonstrate the fact that the chair can accommodate people. While you're sitting in it you can adjust it down for the five footer  or you can adjust it for the six foot six guy    all within the scope of a few simple adjustments. I want to talk about the election. For the first time in the United States  a predominantly white group of voters voted for an African American candidate for President. And in fact Barack Obama did quite well. He won     electoral votes. And he won about    million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate    of any race  of any party    in history. If you compare how Obama did against how John Kerry had done four years earlier    Democrats really like seeing this transition here  where almost every state becomes bluer  becomes more democratic    even states Obama lost  like out west  those states became more blue. In the south  in the northeast  almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there. One exception is in Massachusetts. That was John Kerry's home state. No big surprise  Obama couldn't do better than Kerry there. Or in Arizona  which is John McCain's home  Obama didn't have much improvement. But there is also this part of the country  kind of in the middle region here. This kind of Arkansas  Tennessee  Oklahoma  West Virginia region. Now if you look at '    Bill Clinton    the last Democrat to actually win    how he did in '    you see real big differences in this part of the country right here  the kind of Appalachians  Ozarks  highlands region  as I call it     or    point swings from how Bill Clinton did in '   to how Obama did in     . Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas  but these are very  very profound differences. So  when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas  you know. There is a book written called   What's the Matter with Kansas   But really the question here    Obama did relatively well in Kansas. He lost badly but every Democrat does. He lost no worse than most people do. But yeah  what's the matter with Arkansas  And when we think of Arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations. We think of a bunch of rednecks  quote  unquote  with guns. And we think people like this probably don't want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama. We think it's a matter of race. And is this fair  Are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas  and this part of the country  And the answer is  it is at least partially fair. We know that race was a factor  and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people. Actually we didn't ask them  but when they conducted exit polls in every state  in    states  out of the     they asked a question  that was pretty direct  about race. They asked this question. In deciding your vote for President today  was the race of the candidate a factor  We're looking for people that said   Yes  race was a factor  moreover it was an important factor  in my decision   and people who voted for John McCain as a result of that factor  maybe in combination with other factors  and maybe alone. We're looking for this behavior among white voters or  really  non black voters. So you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question. In Louisiana  about one in five white voters said   Yes  one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama is because he was an African American.  If those people had voted for Obama  even half of them  Obama would have won Louisiana safely. Same is true with  I think  all of these states you see on the top of the list. Meanwhile  California  New York  we can say   Oh we're enlightened  but you know  certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted  I suppose  manifestation of racially based voting. Here is the same data on a map. You kind of see the relationship between the redder states of where more people responded and said   Yes  Barack Obama's race was a problem for me.  You see  comparing the map to '    you see an overlap here. This really seems to explain why Barack Obama did worse in this one part of the country. So we have to ask why. Is racism predictable in some way  Is there something driving this  Is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas that we don't understand  and Kentucky  Or are there more systematic factors at work  And so we can look at a bunch of different variables. These are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time    things like income  and religion  education. Which of these seem to drive this manifestation of racism in this big national experiment we had on November  th  And there are a couple of these that have strong predictive relationships  one of which is education  where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red  and you see this part of the country  the kind of Appalachians region  is less educated. It's just a fact. And you see the relationship there with the racially based voting patterns. The other variable that's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in. States that are more rural    even to some extent of the states like New Hampshire and Maine    they exhibit a little bit of this racially based voting against Barack Obama. So it's the combination of these two things  it's education and the type of neighbors that you have  which we'll talk about more in a moment. And the thing about states like Arkansas and Tennessee is that they're both very rural  and they are educationally impoverished. So yes  racism is predictable. These things  among maybe other variables  but these things seem to predict it. We're going to drill down a little bit more now  into something called the General Social Survey. This is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year. And they ask a series of really interesting questions. In      they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes. One simple question they asked is   Does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood   We can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different. In cites  about    percent of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race  but in rural communities  only about    percent. Probably because if you live on a farm  you might not have a lot of neighbors  period. But nevertheless  you're not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you. So what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors    or  really  some neighbor of another race    and people who have only white neighbors. And we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes  not a lot of difference. This was eight years ago  some people were more Republican back then. But you see Democrats versus Republican  not a big difference based on who your neighbors are. And even some questions about race    for example affirmative action  which is kind of a political question  a policy question about race  if you will    not much difference here. Affirmative action is not very popular frankly  with white voters  period. But people with black neighbors and people with mono racial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really. But if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will   Do you favor a law banning interracial marriage   There is a big difference. People who don't have neighbors of a different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do. Just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you. And likewise they asked  not in       but in the same survey in        Would you not vote for a qualified black president   You see people without neighbors who are African American who were much more likely to say   That would give me a problem.  So it's really not even about urban versus rural. It's about who you live with. Racism is predictable. And it's predicted by interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you  people of other races. So if you want to address it  the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races. I have a couple of very obvious  I suppose  ideas for maybe how to do that. I'm a big fan of cities. Especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable  and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups. I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking  the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis. But also not everyone wants to live in a city  certainly not a city like New York. So we can think more about things like street grids. This is the neighborhood where I grew up in East Lansing  Michigan. It's a traditional Midwestern community  which means you have real grid. You have real neighborhoods and real trees  and real streets you can walk on. And you interact a lot with your neighbors    people you like  people you might not know. And as a result it's a very tolerant community  which is different  I think  than something like this  which is in Schaumburg  Illinois  where every little set of houses has their own cul de sac and drive through Starbucks and stuff like that. I think that actually this type of urban design  which became more prevalent in the     s and     s    I think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under Ronald Reagan. But also here is another idea we have    is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from New York abroad. But frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU  have them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas  and vice versa. Do it at the high school level. Literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from another part of the country  or of another racial group. I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise. But the point is  this is all good news  because when something is predictable  it is what I call designable. You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem  even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism. If we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesn't  we can start to design solutions to it. So that's all I have to say. Thank you very much. So I'm here to tell you a story of success from Africa. A year and a half ago  four of the five people who are full time members at Ushahidi  which means  testimony  in Swahili  were TED Fellows. A year ago in Kenya we had post election violence. And in that time we prototyped and built  in about three days  a system that would allow anybody with a mobile phone to send in information and reports on what was happening around them. We took what we knew about Africa  the default device  the mobile phone  as our common denominator  and went from there. We got reports like this. This is just a couple of them from January   th  last year. And our system was rudimentary. It was very basic. It was a mash up that used data that we collected from people  and we put it on our map. But then we decided we needed to do something more. We needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world. And so there is a team of developers from all over Africa  who are part of this team now    from Ghana  from Malawi  from Kenya. There is even some from the U.S. We're building for smartphones  so that it can be used in the developed world  as well as the developing world. We are realizing that this is true. If it works in Africa then it will work anywhere. And so we build for it in Africa first and then we move to the edges. It's now been deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It's being used by NGOs all over East Africa  small NGOs doing their own little projects. Just this last month it was deployed by Al Jazeera in Gaza. But that's actually not what I'm here to talk about. I'm here to talk about the next big thing  because what we're finding out is that we have this capacity to report eyewitness accounts of what's going on in real time. We're seeing this in events like Mumbai recently  where it's so much easier to report now than it is to consume it. There is so much information  what do you do  This is the Twitter reports for over three days just covering Mumbai. How do you decide what is important  What is the veracity level of what you're looking at  So what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information because there is just too much information for us to actually do anything with right now. And what we're actually really concerned with is this first three hours. What we are looking at is the first three hours. How do we deal with that information that is coming in  You can't understand what is actually happening. On the ground and around the world people are still curious  and trying to figure out what is going on. But they don't know. So what we built of course  Ushahidi  is crowdsourcing this information. You see this with Twitter  too. You get this information overload. So you've got a lot of information. That's great. But now what  So we think that there is something interesting we can do here. And we have a small team who is working on this. We think that we can actually create a crowdsourced filter. Take the crowd and apply them to the information. And by rating it and by rating the different people who submit information  we can get refined results and weighted results. So that we have a better understanding of the probability of something being true or not. This is the kind of innovation that is  quite frankly    it's interesting that it's coming from Africa. It's coming from places that you wouldn't expect. From young  smart developers. And it's a community around it that has decided to build this. So  thank you very much. And we are very happy to be part of the TED family. I'm going to read a few strips. These are  most of these are from a monthly page I do in and architecture and design magazine called Metropolis. And the first story is called  The Faulty Switch.  Another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch. It's fine during the day when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight. But at dusk everything changes. The architect spent hundreds of hours designing the burnished brass switchplates for his new office tower. And then left it to a contractor to install these    cent switches behind them. We know instinctively where to reach when we enter a dark room. We automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward. But the sound we are greeted with  as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late afternoon light  recalls to mind a dirty men's room in the rear of a Greek coffee shop. This sound colors our first impression of any room  it can't be helped. But where does this sound  commonly described as a click  come from  Is it simply the byproduct of a crude mechanical action  Or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment  The often dental consonant of no Indo European language. Or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach  In the     s they tried their best to muffle this sound with mercury switches and silent knob controls. But today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic. The click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life  announcing our entry into every lightless room. The sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature. It has a deep melancholy ring. Children don't like it. It's why they leave lights on around the house.  Laughter  Adults find it comforting. But wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship  Or the recorded crowing of a rooster  Or the distant peel of thunder  Thomas Edison went through thousands of unlikely substances before he came upon the right one for the filament of his electric light bulb. Why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch  That's the end of that. The next story is called  In Praise of the Taxpayer.  That so many of the city's most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom  is cause for celebration. These one or two story structures  designed to yield only enough income to cover the taxes on the land on which they stand  were not meant to be permanent buildings. Yet for one reason or another they have confounded the efforts of developers to be combined into lots suitable for high rise construction. Although they make no claim to architectural beauty  they are  in their perfect temporariness  a delightful alternative to the large scale structures that might someday take their place. The most perfect examples occupy corner lots. They offer a pleasant respite from the high density development around them. A break of light and air  an architectural biding of time. So buried in signage are these structures  that it often takes a moment to distinguish the modern specially constructed taxpayer from its neighbor  the small commercial building from an earlier century  whose upper floors have been sealed  and whose groundfloor space now functions as a taxpayer. The few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive  dark green gray  striated aluminum siding. Take out sandwich shops  film processing drop offs  peep shows and necktie stores. Now these provisional structures have  in some cases  remained standing for the better part of a human lifetime. The temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization  a healthy sublimation of the urge to build  and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone. That's the end. And the next story is called   On the Human Lap.  For the ancient Egyptians the lap was a platform upon which to place the earthly possessions of the dead       cubits from foot to knee. It was not until the   th century that an Italian painter recognized the lap as a Grecian temple  upholstered in flesh and cloth. Over the next     years we see the infant Christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the Virgin's lap  and then back again. Every child recapitulates this ascension  straddling one or both legs  sitting sideways  or leaning against the body. From there  to the modern ventriloquist's dummy  is but a brief moment in history. You were late for school again this morning. The ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap. The illusion of speech follows incidentally. What have you got to say for yourself  Jimmy  As adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance. We have fading memories of that provisional temple  erected each time an adult sat down. On a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on. It is children and teenage girls who are most keenly aware of its architectural beauty. They understand the structural integrity of a deep avuncular lap  as compared to the shaky arrangement of a neurotic niece in high heels. The relationship between the lap and its owner is direct and intimate. I envision a    story      unit residential high rise    a reason to consider the mental health of any architect before granting an important commission. The bathrooms and kitchens will  of course  have no windows. The lap of luxury is an architectural construct of childhood  which we seek  in vain  as adults  to employ. That's the end. The next story is called  The Haverpiece Collection  A nondescript warehouse  visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway  serves as the temporary resting place for the Haverpiece collection of European dried fruit. The profound convolutions on the surface of a dried cherry. The foreboding sheen of an extra large date. Do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries  Where everything was displayed in poorly labeled roach proof bins. Pears dried in the form of genital organs. Apricot halves like the ears of cherubim. In      the unsold stock was purchased by Maurice Haverpiece  a wealthy prune juice bottler  and consolidated to form the core collection. As an art form it lies somewhere between still life painting and plumbing. Upon his death in       a quarter of the items were sold off for compote to a high class hotel restaurant. Unsuspecting guests were served stewed turn of the century Turkish figs for breakfast. The rest of the collection remains here  stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum and study center. A shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar. That's the end. Thank you. The first half of the   th century was an absolute disaster in human affairs  a cataclysm. We had the First World War  the Great Depression  the Second World War and the rise of the communist nations. And each one of these forces split the world  tore the world apart  divided the world. And they threw up walls    political walls  trade walls  transportation walls  communication walls  iron curtains    which divided peoples and nations. It was only in the second half of the   th century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss. Trade walls began to come tumbling down. Here are some data on tariffs  starting at    percent  coming down to less than   percent. We globalized the world. And what does that mean  It means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries  we made the world more cooperative. Transportation walls came tumbling down. You know in      the typical ship carried       to        tons worth of goods. Today a container ship can carry         tons  it can be manned with a smaller crew  and unloaded faster than ever before. Communication walls  I don't have to tell you    the Internet    have come tumbling down. And of course the iron curtains  political walls have come tumbling down. Now all of this has been tremendous for the world. Trade has increased. Here is just a little bit of data. In       exports from China to the United States     billion dollars. By       over     billion dollars. And perhaps most remarkably  at the beginning of the   st century  really for the first time in modern history  growth extended to almost all parts of the world. So China  I've already mentioned  beginning around       around the time of the death of Mao  growth    ten percent a year. Year after year after year  absolutely incredible. Never before in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in China. China is the world's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades. India  starting a little bit later  but in       begetting tremendous growth. Incomes at that time less than        per year. And over the next    years have almost tripled. Growth of six percent a year. Absolutely incredible. Now Africa  Sub Saharan Africa    Sub Saharan Africa has been the area of the world most resistant to growth. And we can see the tragedy of Africa in the first few bars here. Growth was negative. People were actually getting poorer than their parents  and sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been. But at the end of the   th century  the beginning of the   st century  we saw growth in Africa. And I think  as you'll see  there's reasons for optimism  because I believe that the best is yet to come. Now why. On the cutting edge today it's new ideas which are driving growth. And by that I mean it's products for which the research and development costs are really high  and the manufacturing costs are low. More than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge. Now ideas have this amazing property. Thomas Jefferson  I think  really expressed this quite well. He said   He who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself  without lessening mine. As he who lights his candle at mine receives light without darkening me.  Or to put it slightly differently  one apple feeds one man  but an idea can feed the world. Now this is not new. This is practically not new to TEDsters. This is practically the model of TED. But what is new is that the greater function of ideas is going to drive growth even more than ever before. This provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important  more powerful than ever before  and are going to increase growth more than ever before. And to explain why this is so  I have a question. Suppose that there are two diseases  one of them is rare  the other one is common  but if they are not treated they are equally severe. If you had to choose  which would you rather have  the common disease or the rare disease  Common  the common    I think that's absolutely right  and why  Because there are more drugs to treat common diseases than there are to treat rare diseases. The reason for this is incentives. It costs about the same to produce a new drug whether that drug treats       people          people  or a million people. But the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people. So the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people. To put this differently  larger markets save lives. In this case misery truly does love company. Now think about the following  if China and India were as rich as the United States is today  the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now. Now we are not there yet  but it is happening. As other countries become richer the demand for these pharmaceuticals is going to increase tremendously. And that means an increase incentive to do research and development  which benefits everyone in the world. Larger markets increase the incentive to produce all kinds of ideas  whether it's software  whether it's a computer chip  whether it's a new design. For the Hollywood people in the audience  this even explains why action movies have larger budgets than comedies  it's because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures  so the market for those movies is larger. People are willing to invest more  and the budgets are larger. Alright. Well if larger markets increase the incentive to produce new ideas  how do we maximize that incentive  It's by having one world market  by globalizing the world. The way I like to put this is  one idea. Ideas are meant to be shared  so one idea can serve one world  one market. One idea  one world  one market. Well how else can we create new ideas  That's one reason. Globalize trade. How else can we create new ideas  Well  more idea creators. Now idea creators  they come from all walks of life. Artists and innovators    many of the people you've seen on this stage. I'm going to focus on scientists and engineers because I have some data on that  and I'm a data person. Now  today  less than one tenth of one percent of the world's population are scientists and engineers. The United States has been an idea leader. A large fraction of those people are in the United States. But the U.S. is losing its idea leadership. And for that I am very grateful. That is a good thing. It is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader because for too long the United States  and a handful of other developed countries  have shouldered the entire burden of research and development. But consider the following  if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the United States is now there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers contributing to ideas which benefit everyone  which are shared by everyone. I think of the great Indian mathematician  Ramanujan. How many Ramanujans are there in India today toiling in the fields  barely able to feed themselves  when they could be feeding the world  Now we're not there yet. But it is going to happen in this century. The real tragedy of the last century is this  if you think about the world's population as a giant computer  a massively parallel processor  then the great tragedy has been that billions of our processors have been off line. But in this century China is coming on line. India is coming on line. Africa is coming on line. We will see an Einstein in Africa in this century. Here is just some data. This is China.       less than one million new university students in China per year        over five million. Now think what this means. This means we all benefit when another country gets rich. We should not fear other countries becoming wealthy. That is something that we should embrace    a wealthy China  a wealthy India  a wealthy Africa. We need a greater demand for ideas    those larger markets I was talking about earlier    and a greater supply of ideas for the world. Now you can see some of the reasons why I'm optimistic. Globalization is increasing the demand for ideas  the incentive to create new ideas. Investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas. In fact if you look at world history you can see some reasons for optimism. From about the beginnings of humanity to       zero economic growth  nothing.      to       maybe a little bit of economic growth  but less in a century than you expect to see in a year today.     s  maybe one percent. Twentieth century  a little bit over two percent. Twenty first century could easily be  .   even higher percent. Even at that rate  by      average GDP per capita in the world will be         . That's not U.S. GDP per capita  which will be over a million  but world GDP per capita            . That's not that far. We won't make it. But some of our grandchildren probably will. And I should say  I think this is a rather modest prediction. In Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy. In Kurzweilian terms I'm like the Eeyore of economic growth. Alright what about problems  What about a great depression  Well let's take a look. Let's take a look at the Great Depression. Here is GDP per capita from      to     . Now let's imagine that you were an economist in       trying to forecast future growth for the United States  not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff  not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the   th century. What would you have predicted  not knowing this  If you had based your prediction  your forecast on      to      you'd have predicted something like this. If you'd been a little more optimistic    say  based upon the Roaring Twenties    you'd have said this. So what actually happened  We went off a cliff but we recovered. In fact in the second half of the   th century growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted based upon the first half of the   th century. So growth can wash away even what appears to be a great depression. Alright. What else  Oil. Oil. This was a big topic. When I was writing up my notes oil was      per barrel. So people were asking a question. They were saying   Is China drinking our milkshake   And there is some truth to this  in the sense that we have something of a finite resource  and increased growth is going to push up demand for that. But I think I don't have to tell this audience that a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing. Moreover  as everyone knows  look    it's energy  not oil  which counts. And higher oil prices mean a greater incentive to invest in energy R D. You can see this in the data. As oil prices go up  energy patents go up. The world is much better equipped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today  than ever in the past  because of what I'm talking about. One idea  one world  one market. So I'm optimistic so long as we hew to these two ideas  to keep globalizing world markets  keep extending cooperation across national boundaries  and keep investing in education. Now the United States has a particularly important role to play in this  to keep our education system globalized  to keep our education system open to students from all over the world  because our education system is the candle that other students come to light their own candles. Now remember here what Jefferson said. Jefferson said   When they come and light their candles at ours  they gain light  and we are not darkened.  But Jefferson wasn't quite right  was he  Because the truth is  when they light their candles at ours  there is twice as much light available for everyone. So my view is  Be optimistic. Spread the ideas. Spread the light. Thank you. This machine  which we all have residing in our skulls  reminds me of an aphorism  of a comment of Woody Allen to ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull. And it's this machine. And it's constructed for change. It's all about change. It confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we can't do today  things today that we couldn't do yesterday. And of course it's born stupid. The last time you were in the presence of a baby    this happens to be my granddaughter  Mitra. Isn't she fabulous  But nonetheless when she popped out despite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing in its development for several months before on the basis of her experiences in the womb    nonetheless she had very limited abilities  as does every infant at the time of normal  natural full term birth. If we were to assay her perceptual abilities  they would be crude. There is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on. In fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant. Infants don't respond to much. There is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board. And they can only in a very primitive way  and in a very limited way control their movements. It would be several months before this infant could do something as simple as reach out and grasp under voluntary control an object and retrieve it  usually to the mouth. And it will be some months beforeward  and we see a long steady progression of the evolution from the first wiggles  to rolling over  and sitting up  and crawling  standing  walking  before we get to that magical point in which we can motate in the world. And yet  when we look forward in the brain we see really remarkable advance. By this age the brain can actually store. It has stored  recorded  can fastly retrieve the meanings of thousands  tens of thousands of objects  actions  and their relationships in the world. And those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands  potentially millions of ways. By this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities. And it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills. This brain is very much a thinking machine. And by this age there is absolutely no question that this brain  it has a person on board. And in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self development. And by this age we see a remarkable evolution in its capacity to control movement. Now movement has advanced to the point where it can actually control movement simultaneously  in a complex sequence  in complex ways as would be required for example for playing a complicated game  like soccer. Now this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head. And where this boy comes from  Sao Paulo  Brazil  about    percent of boys of his age have this ability. You could go out into the community in Monterey  and you'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability. And if you did he'd probably be from Sao Paulo. That's all another way of saying that our individual skills and abilities are very much shaped by our environments. That environment extends into our contemporary culture  the thing our brain is challenged with. Because what we've done in our personal evolutions is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities that are specific to our own individual histories. And in fact they result in a wonderful differentiation in humankind  in the way that  in fact  no two of us are quite alike. Every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities that all derive out of the plasticity  the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine. In an adult brain of course we've built up a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities that we can perform more or less automatically from memory  and that define us as acting  moving  thinking creatures. Now we study this  as the nerdy  laboratory  university based scientists that we are  by engaging the brains of animals like rats  or monkeys  or of this particularly curious creature    one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth    to engage them in learning new skills and abilities. And we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired. In fact we do this in individuals of any age  in these different species    that is to say from infancies  infancy up to adulthood and old age. So we might engage a rat  for example  to acquire a new skill or ability that might involve the rat using its paw to master particular manual grasp behaviors just like we might examine a child and their ability to acquire the sub skills  or the general overall skill of accomplishing something like mastering the ability to read. Or you might look in an older individual who has mastered a complex set of abilities that might relate to reading musical notation or performing the mechanical acts of performance that apply to musical performance. From these studies we defined two great epochs of the plastic history of the brain. The first great epoch is commonly called the  Critical Period.  And that is the period in which the brain is setting up in its initial form its basic processing machinery. This is actually a period of dramatic change in which it doesn't take learning  per se  to drive the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain. All it takes for example in the sound domain  is exposure to sound. And the brain actually is at the mercy of the sound environment in which it is reared. So for example I can rear an animal in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound  a repertoire of sound that I make up  that I make  just by exposure  artificially important to the animal and its young brain. And what I see is that the animal's brain sets up its initial processing of that sound in a form that's idealized  within the limits of its processing achievements to represent it in an organized and orderly way. The sound doesn't have to be valuable to the animal  I could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable  like the sounds that simulate the sounds of a native language of a child. And I see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized    specialized for that complex array  a repertoire of sounds. It actually exaggerates their separateness of representation  in multi dimensional neuronal representational terms. Or I can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound. I can raise an animal under conditions that would be equivalent to raising a baby under a moderately loud ceiling fan  in the presence of continuous noise. And when I do that I actually specialize the brain to be a master processor for that meaningless sound. And I frustrate its ability to represent any meaningful sound as a consequence. Such things in the early history of babies occur in real babies. And they account for  for example the beautiful evolution of a language specific processor in every normally developing baby. And so they also account for development of defective processing in a substantial population of children who are more limited  as a consequence  in their language abilities at an older age. Now in this early period of plasticity the brain actually changes outside of a learning context. I don't have to be paying attention to what I hear. The input doesn't really have to be meaningful. I don't have to be in a behavioral context. This is required so the brain sets up it's processing so that it can act differentially  so that it can act selectively  so that the creature that wears it  that carries it  can begin to operate on it in a selective way. In the next great epoch of life  which applies for most of life  the brain is actually refining its machinery as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities. And in this epoch  which extends from late in the first year of life to death  it's actually doing this under behavioral control. And that's another way of saying the brain has strategies that define the significance of the input to the brain. And it's focusing on skill after skill  or ability after ability  under specific attentional control. It's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior. This is actually very powerful. This lifelong capacity for plasticity  for brain change  is powerfully expressed. It is the basis of our real differentiation  one individual from another. You can look down in the brain of an animal that's engaged in a specific skill  and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels. So here is a very simple experiment. It was actually conducted about five years ago in collaboration with scientists from the University of Provence in Marseilles. It's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained in a task that involves it manipulating a tool that's equivalent in its difficulty to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon. The monkey actually mastered the task in about     practice tries. So in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all. It had a success rate of about one in eight tries. Those tries were elaborate. Each attempt was substantially different from the other. But the monkey gradually developed a strategy. And     or so tries later the monkey is performing it flawlessly    never fails. He's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time. At this point the task is being performed in a beautifully stereotyped way  very beautifully regulated and highly repeated  trial to trial. We can look down in the brain of the monkey. And we see that it's distorted. We can track these changes  and have tracked these changes in many such behaviors across time. And here we see the distortion reflected in the map of the skin surfaces of the hand of the monkey. Now this is a map  down in the surface of the brain  in which  in a very elaborate experiment we've reconstructed the responses  location by location  in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons. We see here a reconstruction of how the hand is represented in the brain. We've actually distorted the map by the exercise. And that is indicated in the pink. We have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger. These are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool. If we look at the selectivity of responses in the cortex of the monkey  we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics which represents input from the skin of the fingertips that are engaged. In other words there is still a single  simple representation of the fingertips in this most organized of cortical areas of the surface of the skin of the body. Monkey has like you have. And yet now it's represented in substantially finer grain. The monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces. And that is an unknown    unsuspected  maybe  by you    part of acquiring the skill or ability. Now actually we've looked in several different cortical areas in the monkey learning this task. And each one of them changes in ways that are specific to the skill or ability. So for example we can look to the cortical area that represents input that's controlling the posture of the monkey. We look in cortical areas that control specific movements  and the sequences of movements that are required in the behavior  and so forth. They are all remodeled. They all become specialized for the task at hand. There are    or    cortical areas that are changed specifically when you learn a simple skill like this. And that represents in your brain  really massive change. It represents the change in a reliable way of the responses of tens of millions  possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain. It represents changes of hundreds of millions  possibly billions of synaptic connections in your brain. This is constructed by physical change. And the level of construction that occurs is massive. Think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general. Or acquiring their native language abilities. The changes are massive. What it's all about is the selective representations of things that are important to the brain. Because in most of the life of the brain this is under control of behavioral context. It's what you pay attention to. It's what's rewarding to you. It's what the brain regards  itself  as positive and important to you. It's all about cortical processing and forebrain specialization. And that underlies your specialization. That is why you  in your many skills and abilities  are a unique specialist  a specialist that's vastly different in your physical brain in detail than the brain of an individual     years ago  enormously different in the details from the brain of the average individual       years ago. Now  one of the characteristics of this change process is that information is always related to other inputs or information that is occurring in immediate time  in context. And that's because the brain is constructing representations of things that are correlated in little moments of time and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time. The brain is recording all information and driving all change in temporal context. Now overwhelmingly the most powerful context that's occurred in your brain is you. Billions of events have occurred in your history that are related in time to yourself as the receiver  or yourself as the actor  yourself as the thinker  yourself as the mover. Billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in from the surface of your body that are always associated with you as the receiver  and that result in the embodiment of you. You are constructed  your self is constructed from these billions of events. It's constructed. It's created in your brain. And it's created in the brain via physical change. This is a marvelously constructed thing that results in individual form because each one of us has vastly different histories  and vastly different experiences  that drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self  of personhood. Now we've used this research to try to understand not just how a normal person develops  and elaborates their skills and abilities  but also try to understand the origins of impairment  and the origins of differences or variations that might limit the capacities of a child  or an adult. I'm going to talk about using these strategies to actually design brain plasticity based approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child that increases the competence of the child as a language receiver and user and  thereafter  as a reader. And I'm going to talk about experiments that involve actually using this brain science  first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age. And then  by using it in a targeted approach we're going to try to differentiate the machinery to recover function in old age. So the first example I'm going to talk about relates to children with learning impairments. We now have a large body of literature that demonstrates that the fundamental problem that occurs in the majority of children that have early language impairments  and that are going to struggle to learn to read  is that their language processor is created in a defective form. And the reason that it rises in a defective form is because early in the baby's brain's life the machine process is noisy. It's that simple. It's a signal to noise problem. Okay  And there are a lot of things that contribute to that. There are numerous inherited faults that could make the machine process noisier. Now I might say the noise problem could also occur on the basis of information provided in the world from the ears. If any    those of you who are older in the audience know that when I was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate was born with what we called mental retardation. We knew that they were going to be slow cognitively  we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities  and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read. Most of them would be intellectual and academic failures. That's disappeared. That no longer applies. That inherited weakness  that inherited condition has evaporated. We don't hear about that anymore. Where did it go  Well  it was understood by a Dutch surgeon  about    years ago  that if you simply fix the problem early enough  when the brain is still in this initial plastic period so it can set up this machinery adequately  in this initial set up time in the critical period  none of that happens. What are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it  You're basically opening up the tubes that drain fluid from the middle ears  which have had them reliably full. Every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled. It's degraded. The child's native language is such a case is not English. It's not Japanese. It's muffled English. It's degraded Japanese. It's crap. And the brain specializes for it. It creates a representation of language crap. And then the child is stuck with it. Now the crap doesn't just happen in the ear. It can also happen in the brain. The brain itself can be noisy. It's commonly noisy. There are many inherited faults that can make it noisier. And the native language for a child with such a brain is degraded. It's not English. It's noisy English. And that results in defective representations of sounds of words    not normal    a different strategy  by a machine that has different time constants and different space constants. And you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants. They are about an order of magnitude longer  about    times longer in duration on average  than in a normal child. Space constants are about three times greater. Such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain. Of course they will. Because as a receiver of language  they are receiving it and representing it  and in information it's representing crap. And they are going to have poor reading skills. Because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds into this orthographic or visual representational form. If you don't have a brain representation of word sounds that translation makes no sense. And you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology. Then these children increasingly in evaluation after evaluation  in their operations in language  and their operations in reading    we document that abnormal neurology. The point is is that you can train the brain out of this. A way to think about this is you can actually re refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it. Changing it in detail. It takes about    hours on the average. And we've accomplished that in about         kids today. Actually  probably about        children are being trained as we speak. And actually when you look at the impacts  the impacts are substantial. So here we're looking at the normal distribution. What we're most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution. This is from about       children. You can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution are moving into the middle or the right. This is in a broad assessment of their language abilities. This is like an IQ test for language. The impact in the distribution  if you trained every child in the United States  would be to shift the whole distribution to the right and narrow the distribution. This is a substantially large impact. Think of a classroom of children in the language arts. Think of the children on the slow side of the class. We have the potential to move most of those children to the middle or to the right side. In addition to accurate language training it also fixes memory and cognition speech fluency and speech production. And an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training    that is to say reading. And to a large extent it fixes the brain. You can look down in the brain of a child in a variety of tasks that scientists have at Stanford  and MIT  and UCSF  and UCLA  and a number of other institutions. And children operating in various language behaviors  or in various reading behaviors  you see for the most extent  for most children  their neuronal responses  complexly abnormal before you start  are normalized by the training. Now you can also take the same approach to address problems in aging. Where again the machinery is deteriorating now from competent machinery  it's going south. Noise is increasing in the brain. And learning modulation and control is deteriorating. And you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual and witness a change in the time constants and space constants with which  for example  the brain is representing language again. Just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning  it's going back into chaos in the end. This results in declines in memory in cognition  and in postural ability and agility. It turns out you can train the brain of such an individual    this is a small population of such individuals    train equally intensively for about    hours. These are     to    year olds. And what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory  of their ability to remember things after a delay  of their ability to control their attention  their language abilities and visual spatial abilities. The overall neuropsychological index of these trained individuals in this population is about two standard deviations. That means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution  and I'm looking at your neuropyschological abilities  the average person has moved to the middle or the right side of the distribution. It means that most people who are at risk for senility  more or less immediately  are now in a protected position. My issues are to try to get to rescuing older citizens more completely and in larger numbers  because I think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale    and the same for kids. My main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies. I'm specifically interested in things like autism  and cerebral palsy  these great childhood catastrophes. And in older age conditions like Parkinsonism  and in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia. Your issues as it relates to this science  is how to maintain your own high functioning learning machine. And of course  a well ordered life in which learning is a continuous part of it  is key. But also in your future is brain aerobics. Get ready for it. It's going to be a part of every life not too far in the future  just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period. The other way that we will ultimately come to consider this literature and the science that is important to you is in a consideration of how to nurture yourself. Now that you know  now that science is telling us that you are in charge  that it's under your control  that your happiness  your well being  your abilities  your capacities  are capable of continuous modification  continuous improvement  and you're the responsible agent and party. Of course a lot of people will ignore this advice. It will be a long time before they really understand it. Now that's another issue and not my fault. Okay. Thank you. I should tell you that when I was asked to be here  I thought to myself that well  it's TED. And these TEDsters are    you know  as innocent as that name sounds    these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world. And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that  And so I thought perhaps a really civilized sounding British accent might help things a bit. And then I thought no  no. I should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way I really talk because  after all  this is the great unveiling. And so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you. Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English because I am from Queens  New York. But the theme of this session  of course  is invention. And while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of  you will be meeting a few of my inventions today. I suppose it's fair to say that I am interested in the invention of self or selves. We're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits  unique developmental experiences  geographical and historical contexts. But then what  To what extent do we self construct  do we self invent  How do we self identify and how mutable is that identity  Like  what if one could be anyone at any time  Well my characters  like the ones in my shows  allow me to play with the spaces between those questions. And so I've brought a couple of them with me. And well  they're very excited. What I should tell you    what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks. So feel free to think of this as Sarah University. Okay. Okay. Oh  well. Oh  wonderful. Good evening everybody. Thank you so very much for having me here today. Ah  thank you very much. My name is Lorraine Levine. Oh my  There's so many of you. Hi sweetheart. Okay. Anyway  I am here because of a young girl  Sarah Jones. She's a very nice  young black girl. Well you know  she calls herself black    she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her. But anyway. She has me here because she puts me in her show  what she calls her one woman show. And you know what that means  of course. That means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work. But I don't mind. Frankly  I'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this  you know. Really  it's amazing. Not only  of course  the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities. There are so many celebrities running around here. I saw    Glenn Close I saw earlier. I love her. And she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe. Isn't that adorable  So many others you see  they're just wonderful. It's lovely to know they're concerned  you know. And    oh  I saw Goldie Hawn. Oh  Goldie Hawn. I love her  too  she's wonderful. Yeah. You know  she's only half Jewish. Did you know that about her  Yeah. But even so  a wonderful talent.  Laughter  And I    you know  when I saw her  such a wonderful feeling. Yeah  she's lovely. But anyway  I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel. It's such an eye opening experience to be here. You're all so responsible for this world that we live in today. You know  I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl. And you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time    you're all so young. You know  your parents must be very proud. But I    I also appreciate the diversity that you have here. I noticed it's very multicultural. You know  when you're standing up here  you can see all the different people. It's like a rainbow. It's okay to say rainbow. Yeah. I just    I can't keep up with whether you can say  you know  the different things. What are you allowed to say or not say  I just    I don't want to offend anybody. You know. But anyway  you know  I just think that to be here with all of you accomplished young people    literally  some of you  the architects building our brighter future. You know  it's heartening to me. Even though  quite frankly  some of your presentations are horrifying  absolutely horrifying. It's true. It's true. You know  between the environmental degradation and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about. And of course  we know it's all because of the    all the ... Well  I don't know how else to say it to you  so I'll just say it my way  the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the  you know  the bankers and the Wall Street. You know it. Anyway. The point is  I'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess. So I salute each of you and your stellar achievements. Thank you for all that you do. And congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become TED meisters. So  happy continued success. Congratulations. Mazel tov. Hi. Hi. Thank you everybody. Sorry  this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything  to be here right now. My name is Noraida. And I'm just    I'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference that you're doing and everything like that. I am Dominican American. Actually  you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic  otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City. But I don't know if there's any other Dominican people here  but I know that Juan Enriquez  he was here yesterday. And I think he's Mexican  so that's    honestly  that's close enough for me right now. So    I just    I'm sorry. I'm just trying not to be nervous because this is a very wonderful experience for me and everything. And I just    you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking. And whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast. Nobody can understand nothing I'm saying  which is very frustrating for me  as you can imagine. I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath. But then on top of that  you know  Sarah Jones told me we only have    minutes. So then I'm like  should I be nervous  you know  because maybe it's better. And I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like  take a deep breath. Okay. Sorry. So anyway  what I was trying to say is that I really love TED. Like  I love everything about this. It's amazing. Like  it's    I can't get over this right now. And  like  people would not believe  seriously  where I'm from  that this even exists. You know  like even  I mean I love like the name  the    TED. I mean I know it's a real person and everything  but I'm just saying that like  you know  I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym  you know  which is like  you know  is like very high concept and everything like that. I like that. And actually  I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything. Because  actually  I'm a sophomore at college right now. At my school    actually I was part of co founding an organization  which is like a leadership thing  you know  like you guys  you would really like it and everything. And the organization is called DA BOMB  A and DA BOMB    not like what you guys can build and everything    it's like  DA BOMB  it means like Dominican    it's an acronym    Dominican American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies. So  I know  see  like the name is like a little bit long  but with the war on terror and everything  the Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea  whatever. So  basically like DA BOMB    what Dominican American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does is  basically  we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me. I am a working mother  and I also go to school full time. And  you know  it's like    it's so important to have like role models out there. I mean  I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different  whatever. But like even at my job    like  I just got promoted. Right now it's very exciting actually for me because I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director under the Senior Vice President for Business Development    that's my new title. So  but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me  like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning. And if everybody  like all people really had access to that  it would be a very different world out there  as I know you know. So  I think all people  we need that  but especially  I look at people like me  you know like  I mean  Latinos    we're about to be the majority  in like two weeks. So  we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else. So  I'm very happy that you're  you know  doing this kind of thing  making the talks available online. That's very good. I love that. And I just    I love you guys. I love TED. And if you don't mind  privately now  in the future  I'm going to think of TED as an acronym for Technology  Entertainment and Dominicans. Thank you very much. So  that was Noraida  and just like Lorraine and everybody else you're meeting today  these are folks who are based on real people from my real life  friends  neighbors  family members. I come from a multicultural family. In fact  the older lady you just met  very  very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side. It's a long story  believe me. But on top of my family background  my parents also sent me to the United Nations school  where I encountered a plethora of new characters  including Alexandre  my French teacher  okay. Well  you know  it was beginner French  that I am taking with her  you know. And it was Madame Bousson  you know  she was very  French . It was like  you know  she was there in the class  you know  she was kind of typically French. You know  she was very chic  but she was very filled with ennui  you know. And she would be there  you know  kind of talking with the class  you know  talking about the  you know  the existential futility of life  you know. And we were only    years old  so it was not appropriate.  Laughter  But  German . Yes  I took German for three years   German   and it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class  even in the UN school. Although  you know  it was wonderful. The teacher  Herr Schtopf  he never discriminated. Never. He always  always treated each of us  you know  equally unbearably during the class. So  there were the teachers and then there were my friends  classmates from everywhere  many of whom are still dear friends to this day. And they've inspired many characters as well. For example  a friend of mine. Well  I just wanted to quickly say good evening. My name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity. Of course  TED  the reputation precedes itself all over the world. But  you know  I am originally from India  and I wanted to start by telling you that once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to TED in California  originally  I was very pleased and  frankly  relieved because  you know  I am a human rights advocate. And usually my work  it takes me to Washington D.C. And there  I must attend these meetings  mingling with some tiresome politicians  trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown.  Laughter  So  you can just imagine    right. So  but I'm thrilled to be joining all of you here. I wish we had more time together  but that's for another time. Okay  Great. And  sadly  I don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody I brought  but    I'm trying to behave myself  it's my first time here. But I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize  if you saw  Bridge and Tunnel.  Uh  well  thank you. Good evening. My name is Pauline Ning  and first I want to tell you that I'm    of course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York. But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED  I said  well  you know  first  I don't know that  you know    before two years ago  you would not find me in front of an audience of people  much less like this because I did not like to give speeches because I feel that  as an immigrant  I do not have good English skills for speaking. But then  I decided  just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger  I try anyway. My daughter    my daughter wrote that  she told me   Always start your speech with humor.  But my background    I want to tell you story only briefly. My husband and I  we brought our son and daughter here in     s to have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time. And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition  but it's very hard. You know  as immigrant  I would speak Chinese to them  and they would always answer me back in English. They love rock music  pop culture  American culture. But when they got older  when the time comes for them to start think about getting married  that's when we expect them to realize  a little bit more  their own culture. But that's where we had some problems. My son  he says he is not ready to get married. And he has a sweetheart  but she is American woman  not Chinese. It's not that it's bad  but I told him   What's wrong with a Chinese woman   But I think he will change his mind soon. So  then I decide instead  I will concentrate on my daughter. The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom. But first  she said she's not interested. She only wants to spend time with her friends. And then at college  it's like she never came home. And she doesn't want me to come and visit. So I said   What's wrong in this picture   So  I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend. But she told me   Mom  you don't have to worry about boys because I don't like them.  And I said   Yes  men can be difficult  but all women have to get used to that.  She said   No Mom. I mean  I don't like boys. I like girls. I am lesbian.  So  I always teach my kids to respect American ideas  but I told my daughter that this is one exception    that she is not gay  she is just confused by this American problem. But she told me   Mom  it's not American.  She said she is in love    in love with a nice Chinese girl. So  these are the words I am waiting to hear  but from my son  not my daughter. But at first I did not know what to do. But then  over time  I have come to understand that this is who she is. So  even though sometimes it's still hard  I will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant  usually because of places like this  because of ideas like this  and people like you  with an open mind. So I think maybe TED  you impact people's lives in the ways maybe even you don't realize. So  for my daughter's sake  I thank you for your ideas worth spreading. Thank you. Xie xie. Good evening. My name is Habbi Belahal. And I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones for putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her to be last today. I am originally from Jordan. And I teach comparative literature at Queens College. It is not Harvard. But I feel a bit like a fish out of water. But I am very proud of my students. And I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference. So you will get the extra credit I promised you. But  while I know that I may not look like the typical TED izen  as you would say  I do like to make the point that we in global society  we are never as different as the appearances may suggest. So  if you will indulge me  I will share quickly with you a bit of verse  which I memorized as a young girl at    years of age. So  back in the ancient times.  Arabic  And this roughly translates   Please  let me hold your hand. I want to hold your hand. I want to hold your hand. And when I touch you  I feel happy inside. It's such a feeling that my love  I can't hide  I can't hide  I can't hide.  Well  so okay  but please  please  but please. If it is sounding familiar  it is because I was at the same time in my life listening to the Beatles. On the radio  unclear   they were very popular. So  all of that is to say that I like to believe that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another  there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme. And I pray that this is the way that we will self invent  in time. That's all  shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Okay  Great. Thank you all very much. It was lovely. Thank you for having me. Thank you very  very much. I love you. Well  you have to let me say this. I just    thank you. I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline  and just everyone for having me here. It's been a long time coming  and I feel like I'm home. And I know I've performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere  but this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced. The whole thing is amazing  and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon. So the first question is  why do we need to even worry about a pandemic threat  What is it that we're concerned about  When I say  we   I'm at the Council on Foreign Relations. We're concerned in the national security community  and of course in the biology community and the public health community. While globalization has increased travel  it's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere  all the time  all over the world. And that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you. So a plague outbreak in Surat  India becomes not an obscure event  but a globalized event    a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation. Katrina showed us that we cannot completely depend on government to have readiness in hand  to be capable of handling things. Indeed  an outbreak would be multiple Katrinas at once. Our big concern at the moment is a virus called H N  flu    some of you call it bird flu    which first emerged in southern China  in the mid     s  but we didn't know about it until     . At the end of last Christmas only    countries had seen H N . But we're now up to    countries in the world  have had this virus emerge  in either birds  or people or both. In the bird outbreaks we now can see that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus except the Americas. And I'll get into why we've so far been spared in a moment. In domestic birds  especially chickens  it's     percent lethal. It's one of the most lethal things we've seen in circulation in the world in any recent centuries. And we've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens  and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers with the result that there's cover up. It's also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds. There has been this centralized event in a place called Lake Chenghai  China. Two years ago the migrating birds had a multiple event where thousands died because of a mutation occurring in the virus  which made the species range broaden dramatically. So that birds going to Siberia  to Europe  and to Africa carried the virus  which had not previously been possible. We're now seeing outbreaks in human populations    so far  fortunately  small events  tiny outbreaks  occasional clusters. The virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years to form two distinct families  if you will  of the H N  viral tree with branches in them  and with different attributes that are worrying. So what's concerning us  Well  first of all  at no time in history have we succeeded in making in a timely fashion  a specific vaccine for more than     million people. It's not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic. You've heard about the vaccine we're stockpiling. But nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective if we have a real outbreak. So one thought is  after       when the airports closed  our flu season was delayed by two weeks. So the thought is  hey  maybe what we should do is just immediately    we hear there is H N  spreading from human to human  the virus has mutated to be a human to human transmitter    let's shut down the airports. However  huge supercomputer analyses  done of the likely effectiveness of this  show that it won't buy us much time at all. And of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans. For example  all masks are made in China. How do you get them mobilized around the world if you've shut all the airports down  How do you get the vaccines moved around the world and the drugs moved  and whatever may or not be available that would work. So it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive. We're worried because this virus  unlike any other flu we've ever studied  can be transmitted by eating raw meat of the infected animals. We've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats  and now also domestic pet dogs. And in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets  we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu  seizures  central nervous system disorders  partial paralysis. This is not your normal garden variety flu. It mimics what we now understand about reconstructing the      flu virus  the last great pandemic  in that it also jumped directly from birds to people. We had evolution over time  and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings     percent of people who have become infected with H N  have  in fact  succumbed. And we don't have a huge number of people who got infected and never developed disease. In experimental feeding in monkeys you can see that it actually downregulates a specific immune system modulator. The result is that what kills you is not the virus directly  but your own immune system overreacting  saying   Whatever this is so foreign I'm going berserk.  The result  most of the deaths have been in people under    years of age  robustly healthy young adults. We have seen human to human transmission in at least three clusters    fortunately involving very intimate contact  still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk. Alright  so I've got you nervous. Now you probably assume  well the governments are going to do something. And we have spent a lot of money. Most of the spending in the Bush administration has actually been more related to the anthrax results and bio terrorism threat. But a lot of money has been thrown out at the local level and at the federal level to look at infectious diseases. End result  only    states have been certified to be able to do mass distribution of vaccine and drugs in a pandemic. Half the states would run out of hospital beds in the first week  maybe two weeks. And    states already have an acute nursing shortage. Add on pandemic threat  you're in big trouble. So what have people been doing with this money  Exercises  drills  all over the world. Let's pretend there's a pandemic. Let's everybody run around and play your role. Main result is that there is tremendous confusion. Most of these people don't actually know what their job will be. And the bottom line  major thing that has come through in every single drill  nobody knows who's in charge. Nobody knows the chain of command. If it were Los Angeles  is it the mayor  the governor  the President of the United States  the head of Homeland Security  In fact  the federal government says it's a guy called the Principle Federal Officer  who happens to be with TSA. The government says the federal responsibility will basically be about trying to keep the virus out  which we all know is impossible  and then to mitigate the impact primarily on our economy. The rest is up to your local community. Everything is about your town  where you live. Well how good a city council you have  how good a mayor you have    that's who's going to be in charge. Most local facilities would all be competing to try and get their hands on their piece of the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu  which may or may not be helpful    I'll get into that    of available vaccines  and any other treatments  and masks  and anything that's been stockpiled. And you'll have massive competition. Now we did purchase a vaccine  you've probably all heard about it  made by Sanofi Aventis. Unfortunately it's made against the current form of H N . We know the virus will mutate. It will be a different virus. The vaccine will probably be useless. So here's where the decisions come in. You're the mayor of your local town. Let's see  should we order that all pets be kept indoors  Germany did that when H N  appeared in Germany last year  in order to minimize the spread between households by household cats  dogs and so on. What do we do when we don't have any containment rooms with reverse air that will allow the healthcare workers to take care of patients  These are in Hong Kong  we have nothing like that here. What about quarantine  During the SARS epidemic in Beijing quarantine did seem to help. We have no uniform policies regarding quarantine across the United States. And some states have differential policies  county by county. But what about the no brainer things  Should we close all the schools  Well then what about all the workers  They won't go to work if their kids aren't in school. Encouraging telecommuting  What works  Well the British government did a model of telecommuting. Six weeks they had all people in the banking industry pretend a pandemic was underway. What they found was  the core functions    you know you still sort of had banks  but you couldn't get people to put money in the ATM machines. Nobody was processing the credit cards. Your insurance payments didn't go through. And basically the economy would be in a disaster state of affairs. And that's just office workers  bankers. We don't know how important hand washing is for flu    shocking. One assumes it's a good idea to wash your hands a lot. But actually in scientific community there is great debate about what percentage of flu transmission between people is from sneezing and coughing and what percentage is on your hands. The Institute of Medicine tried to look at the masking question. Can we figure out a way  since we know we won't have enough masks because we don't make them in America anymore  they're all made in China    do we need N    A state of the art  top of the line  must be fitted to your face mask  Or can we get away with some different kinds of masks  In the SARS epidemic  we learned in Hong Kong that most of transmission was because people were removing their masks improperly. And their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask  and then they rubbed their nose. Bingo  They got SARS. It wasn't flying microbes. If you go online right now  you'll get so much phony baloney information. You'll end up buying    this is called an N   mask. Ridiculous. We don't actually have a standard for what should be the protective gear for the first responders  the people who will actually be there on the front lines. And Tamiflu. You've probably heard of this drug  made by Hoffmann La Roche  patented drug. There is some indication that it may buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak. Should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time  well  one of the side effects is suicidal ideations. A public health survey analyzed the effect that large scale Tamiflu use would have  actually shows it counteractive to public health measures  making matters worse. And here is the other interesting thing  when a human being ingests Tamiflu  only    percent is metabolized appropriately to be an active compound in the human being. The rest turns into a stable compound  which survives filtration into the water systems  thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu and providing them a chance to breed resistant strains. And we now have seen Tamiflu resistant strains in both Vietnam in person to person transmission  and in Egypt in person to person transmission. So I personally think that our life expectancy for Tamiflu as an effective drug is very limited    very limited indeed. Nevertheless most of the governments have based their whole flu policies on building stockpiles of Tamiflu. Russia has actually stockpiled enough for    percent of all Russians. We've stockpiled enough for    percent. When I say enough  that's two weeks worth. And then you're on your own because the pandemic is going to last for    to    months. Some of the poorer countries that have had the most experience with H N  have built up stockpiles  they're already expired. They are already out of date. What do we know from       the last great pandemic  The federal government abdicated most responsibility. And so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations all over America. Every city  county  state did their own thing. And the rules and the belief systems were wildly disparate. In some cases all schools  all churches  all public venues were closed. The pandemic circulated three times in    months in the absence of commercial air travel. The second wave was the mutated  super killer wave. And in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers. But by the time the second wave hit it took such a toll among the healthcare workers that we lost most of our doctors and nurses that were on the front lines. Overall we lost         people. The virus was     percent lethal to pregnant women and we don't actually know why. Most of the death toll was    to    year olds    robustly healthy young adults. It was likened to the plague. We don't actually know how many people died. The low ball estimate is    million. This was based on European and North American data. A new study by Chris Murray at Harvard shows that if you look at the databases that were kept by the Brits in India  there was a    fold greater death rate among the Indians. So there is a strong belief that in places of poverty the death toll was far higher. And that a more likely toll is somewhere in the neighborhood of    to     million people before we had commercial air travel. So are we ready  As a nation  no we're not. And I think even those in the leadership would say that is the case  that we still have a long ways to go. So what does that mean for you  Well the first thing is  I wouldn't start building up personal stockpiles of anything    for yourself  your family  or your employees    unless you've really done your homework. What mask works  what mask doesn't work. How many masks do you need  The Institute of Medicine study felt that you could not recycle masks. Well if you think it's going to last    months  are you going to buy    months worth of masks for every single person in your family  We don't know    again with Tamiflu  the number one side effect of Tamiflu is flu like symptoms. So then how can you tell who in your family has the flu if everybody is taking Tamiflu  If you expand that out to think of a whole community  or all your employees in your company  you begin to realize how limited the Tamiflu option might be. Everybody has come up to me and said  well I'll stockpile water or  I'll stockpile food  or what have you. But really  Do you really have a place to stockpile    months worth of food  Twenty four months worth of food  Do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the     s people viewed the civil defense issue  and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu  I don't think that's rational. I think it's about having to be prepared as communities  not as individuals    being prepared as nation  being prepared as state  being prepared as town. And right now most of the preparedness is deeply flawed. And I hope I've convinced you of that  which means that the real job is go out and say to your local leaders  and your national leaders   Why haven't you solved these problems  Why are you still thinking that the lessons of Katrina do not apply to flu   And put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put. But I guess the other thing to add is  if you do have employees  and you do have a company  I think you have certain responsibilities to demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them  and you are trying to plan. At a minimum the British banking plan showed that telecommuting can be helpful. It probably does reduce exposure because people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other  or touching common objects and sharing things via their hands. But can you sustain your company that way  Well if you have a dot com  maybe you can. Otherwise you're in trouble. Happy to take your questions. Audience member  What factors determine the duration of a pandemic  Laurie Garret  What factors determine the duration of a pandemic  we don't really know. I could give you a bunch of flip  this  that  and the other. But I would say that honestly we don't know. Clearly the bottom line is the virus eventually attenuates  and ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity  and finds other hosts. But we don't really know how and why that happens. It's a very complicated ecology. Audience member  What kind of triggers are you looking for  You know way more than any of us. To say ahh  if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic  LG  The moment that you see any evidence of serious human to human to transmission. Not just intimately between family members who took care of an ailing sister or brother  but a community infected    spread within a school  spread within a dormitory  something of that nature. Then I think that there is universal agreement now  at WHO all the way down  Send out the alert. Audience member  Some research has indicated that statins can be helpful. Can you talk about that  LG  Yeah. There is some evidence that taking Lipitor and other common statins for cholesterol control may decrease your vulnerability to influenza. But we do not completely understand why. The mechanism isn't clear. And I don't know that there is any way responsibly for someone to start medicating their children with their personal supply of Lipitor or something of that nature. We have absolutely no idea what that would do. You might be causing some very dangerous outcomes in your children  doing such a thing. Audience member  How far along are we in being able to determine whether someone is actually carrying  whether somebody has this before the symptoms are full blown  LG  Right. So I have for a long time said that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic. And our Centers for Disease Control has labeled a test they developed a rapid diagnostic. It takes    hours in a very highly developed laboratory  in highly skilled hands. I'm thinking dipstick. You could do it to your own kid. It changes color. It tells you if you have H N . In terms of where we are in science with DNA identification capacities and so on  it's not that far off. But we're not there. And there hasn't been the kind of investment to get us there. Audience member  In the      flu I understand that they theorized that there was some attenuation of the virus when it made the leap into humans. Is that likely  do you think  here  I mean     percent death rate is pretty severe. LG  Um yeah. So we don't actually know what the lethality was of the      strain to wild birds before it jumped from birds to humans. It's curious that there is no evidence of mass die offs of chickens or household birds across America before the human pandemic happened. That may be because those events were occurring on the other side of the world where nobody was paying attention. But the virus clearly went through one round around the world in a mild enough form that the British army in World War I actually certified that it was not a threat and would not affect the outcome of the war. And after circulating around the world came back in a form that was tremendously lethal. What percentage of infected people were killed by it  Again we don't really know for sure. It's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with  you had a weakened immune system  you lived in poverty in India or Africa  your likelihood of dying was far greater. But we don't really know. Audience member  One of the things I've heard is that the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia  and that a pneumonia vaccine may offer you    percent better chance of survival. LG  For a long time  researchers in emerging diseases were kind of dismissive of the pandemic flu threat on the grounds that back in      they didn't have antibiotics. And that most people who die of regular flu    which in regular flu years is about         people worldwide  most of them senior citizens    and they die not of the flu but because the flu gives an assault to their immune system. And along comes pneumococcus or another bacteria  streptococcus and boom  they get a bacterial pneumonia. But it turns out that in      that was not the case at all. And so far in the H N  cases in people  similarly bacterial infection has not been an issue at all. It's this absolutely phenomenal disruption of the immune system that is the key to why people die of this virus. And I would just add we saw the same thing with SARS. So what's going on here is your body says  your immune system sends out all its sentinels and says   I don't know what the heck this is. We've never seen anything even remotely like this before.  It won't do any good to bring in the sharpshooters because those antibodies aren't here. And it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery because those T cells don't recognize it either. So we're going to have to go all out thermonuclear response  stimulate the total cytokine cascade. The whole immune system swarms into the lungs. And yes they die  drowning in their own fluids  of pneumonia. But it's not bacterial pneumonia. And it's not a pneumonia that would respond to a vaccine. And I think my time is up. I thank you all for your attention. Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC. And I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked. So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there  the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted       kilometers in circumference. Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began  up to     million times a second. It's nothing if not ambitious. This is the machine below Geneva. We take the pictures of those mini Big Bangs inside detectors. This is the one I work on. It's called the ATLAS detector       meters wide     meters in diameter. Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction so you can see the scale. On the   th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time. And this picture was taken by ATLAS. It caused immense celebration in the control room. It's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC  colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately  and showering particles into the detector. In other words  when we saw that picture on September   th we knew the machine worked  which is a great triumph. I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer  or this  when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that. It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact. About a week later we had a problem with the machine  related actually to these bits of wire here    these gold wires. Those wires carry    thousand amps when the machine is working in full power. Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say   No they don't. They're small wires.  They can do that because when they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire. So at minus     degrees  colder than the space between the stars  those wires can take that current. In one of the joints between over       magnets in LHC  there was a manufacturing defect. So the wire heated up slightly  and its        amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance. This was the result. Now that's more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over    tons  and they moved about a foot. So we damaged about    of the magnets. We had to take them out  which we did. We reconditioned them all  fixed them. They're all on their way back underground now. By the end of March the LHC will be intact again. We will switch it on  and we expect to take data in June or July  and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are. Now of course  in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refute. I think that the fact that it's so difficult  the fact that we're overreaching  is the value of things like the LHC. I will leave the final word to an English scientist  Humphrey Davy  who  I suspect  when defending his protege's useless experiments    his protege was Michael Faraday    said this   Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate  that there are no mysteries in nature  that our triumphs are complete  and that there are no new worlds to conquer.  Thank you. We look around the media  as we see on the news from Iraq  Afghanistan  Sierra Leone  and the conflict seems incomprehensible to us. And that's certainly how it seemed to me when I started this project. But as a physicist  I thought  well if you give me some data  I could maybe understand this. You know  give us a go. So as a naive New Zealander I thought  well I'll go to the Pentagon. Can you get me some information  No. So I had to think a little harder. And I was watching the news one night in Oxford. And I looked down at the chattering heads on my channel of choice. And I saw that there was information there. There was data within the streams of news that we consume. All this noise around us actually has information. So what I started thinking was  perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here. If we can get enough of these streams of information together  we can perhaps start to understand the war. So this is exactly what I did. We started bringing a team together  an interdisciplinary team of scientists  of economists  mathematicians. We brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this. We did it in three steps. The first step we did was to collect. We did     different sources of information    from NGO reports to newspapers and cable news. We brought this raw data in and we filtered it. We extracted the key bits on information to build the database. That database contained the timing of attacks  the location  the size and the weapons used. It's all in the streams of information we consume daily  we just have to know how to pull it out. And once we had this we could start doing some cool stuff. What if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks  What would that tell us  So we started doing this. And you can see here on the horizontal axis you've got the number of people killed in an attack or the size of the attack. And on the vertical axis you've got the number of attacks. So we plot data for sample on this. You see some sort of random distribution    perhaps    attacks  one person was killed  or    attacks where seven people were killed. We did this exact same thing for Iraq. And we didn't know  for Iraq what we were going to find. It turns out what we found was pretty surprising. You take all of the conflict  all of the chaos  all of the noise  and out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict. This blew our mind. Why should a conflict like Iraq have this as its fundamental signature  Why should there be order in war  We didn't really understand that. We thought maybe there is something special about Iraq. So we looked at a few more conflicts. We looked at Colombia  we looked at Afghanistan  and we looked at Senegal. And the same pattern emerged in each conflict. This wasn't supposed to happen. These are different wars  with different religious factions  different political factions  and different socioeconomic problems. And yet the fundamental patterns underlying them are the same. So we went a little wider. We looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on. From Peru to Indonesia  we studied this same pattern again. And we found that not only were the distributions these straight lines  but the slope of these lines  they clustered around this value of alpha equals  . . And we could generate an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack. What we're saying here is the probability of an attack killing X number of people in a country like Iraq is equal to a constant  times the size of that attack  raised to the power of negative alpha. And negative alpha is the slope of that line I showed you before. So what  This is data  statistics. What does it tell us about these conflicts  That was a challenge we had to face as physicists. How do we explain this  And what we really found was that alpha  if we think about it  is the organizational structure of the insurgency. Alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks  which is really the distribution of the group strength carrying out the attacks. So we look at a process of group dynamics  coalescence and fragmentation  groups coming together  groups breaking apart. And we start running the numbers on this. Can we simulate it  Can we create the kind of patterns that we're seeing in places like Iraq  Turns out we kind of do a reasonable job. We can run these simulations. We can recreate this using a process of group dynamics to explain the patterns that we see all around the conflicts around the world. So what's going on  Why should these different    seemingly different conflicts have the same patterns  Now what I believe is going on is that the insurgent forces  they evolve over time. They adapt. And it turns out there is only one solution to fight a much stronger enemy. And if you don't find that solution as an insurgent force  you don't exist. So every insurgent force that is ongoing  every conflict that is ongoing  it's going to look something like this. And that is what we think is happening. Taking it forward  how do we change it  How do we end a war like Iraq  What does it look like  Alpha is the structure. It's got a stable state at  . . This is what wars look like when they continue. We've got to change that. We can push it up  the forces become more fragmented  there is more of them  but they are weaker. Or we push it down  they're more robust  there is less groups  but perhaps you can sit and talk to them. So this graph here  I'm going to show you now. No one has seen this before. This is literally stuff that we've come through last week. And we see the evolution of Alpha through time. We see it start. And we see it grow up to the stable state the wars around the world look like. And it stays there through the invasion of Fallujah until the Samarra bombings in the Iraqi elections of '  . And the system gets perturbed. It moves upwards to a fragmented state. This is when the surge happens. And depending on who you ask  the surge was supposed to push it up even further. The opposite happened. The groups became stronger. They became more robust. And so I'm thinking  right  great  it's going to keep going down. We can talk to them. We can get a solution. The opposite happened. It's moved up again. The groups are more fragmented. And this tells me one of two things. Either we're back where we started and the surge has had no effect  or finally the groups have been fragmented to the extent that we can start to think about maybe moving out. I don't know what the answer is to that. But I know that we should be looking at the structure of the insurgency to answer that question. Thank you. What I want to do today is to spend some time talking about some stuff that's sort of giving me a little bit of existential angst  for lack of a better word  over the past couple of years  and basically  these three quotes tell what's going on.  When God made the color purple  God was just showing off   Alice Walker wrote in  The Color Purple   and Zora Neale Hurston wrote in  Dust Tracks On A Road    Research is a formalized curiosity. It's poking and prying with a purpose.  And then finally  when I think about the near future  you know  we have this attitude  well  whatever happens  happens. Right  So that goes along with the Chesire Cat saying   If you don't care much where you want to get to  it doesn't much matter which way you go.  But I think it does matter which way we go  and what road we take  because when I think about design in the near future  what I think are the most important issues  what's really crucial and vital is that we need to revitalize the arts and sciences right now in     . If we describe the near future as            years from now  that means that what we do today is going to be critically important  because in the year       and the year             the world our society is going to be building on  the basic knowledge and abstract ideas  the discoveries that we came up with today  just as all these wonderful things we're hearing about here at the TED conference that we take for granted in the world right now  were really knowledge and ideas that came up in the '  s  the '  s  and the '  s. That's the substrate that we're exploiting today  whether it's the internet  genetic engineering  laser scanners  guided missiles  fiber optics  high definition television  sensing  remote sensing from space and the wonderful remote sensing photos that we see in  D weaving  TV programs like Tracker  and Enterprise  CD rewrite drives  flatscreen  Alvin Ailey's Suite Otis  or Sarah Jones'  Your Revolution Will Not Be Between These Thighs   which by the way was banned by the FCC  or ska  all of these things without question  almost without exception  are really based on ideas and abstract and creativity from years before  so we have to ask ourselves  what are we contributing to that legacy right now  And when I think about it  I'm really worried. To be quite frank  I'm concerned. I'm skeptical that we're doing very much of anything. We're  in a sense  failing to act in the future. We're purposefully  consciously being laggards. We're lagging behind. Frantz Fanon  who was a psychiatrist from Martinique  said   Each generation must  out of relative obscurity  discover its mission  and fulfill or betray it.  What is our mission  What do we have to do  I think our mission is to reconcile  to reintegrate science and the arts  because right now there's a schism that exists in popular culture. You know  people have this idea that science and the arts are really separate. We think of them as separate and different things  and this idea was probably introduced centuries ago  but it's really becoming critical now  because we're making decisions about our society every day that  if we keep thinking that the arts are separate from the sciences  and we keep thinking it's cute to say   I don't understand anything about this one  I don't understand anything about the other one   then we're going to have problems. Now I know no one here at TED thinks this. All of us  we already know that they're very connected  but I'm going to let you know that some folks in the outside world  believe it or not  they think it's neat when they say   You know  scientists and science is not creative. Maybe scientists are ingenious  but they're not creative. And then we have this tendency  the career counselors and various people say things like   Artists are not analytical. They're ingenious  perhaps  but not analytical   and when these concepts underly our teaching and what we think about the world  then we have a problem  because we stymie support for everything. By accepting this dichotomy  whether it's tongue in cheek  when we attempt to accommodate it in our world  and we try to build our foundation for the world  we're messing up the future  because  who wants to be uncreative  Who wants to be illogical  Talent would run from either of these fields if you said you had to choose either. Then they're going to go to something where they think   Well  I can be creative and logical at the same time.  Now I grew up in the '  s and I'll admit it  actually  my childhood spanned the '  s  and I was a wannabe hippie and I always resented the fact that I wasn't really old enough to be a hippie. And I know there are people here  the younger generation who want to be hippies  but people talk about the '  s all the time  and they talk about the anarchy that was there  but when I think about the '  s  what I took away from it was that there was hope for the future. We thought everyone could participate. There were wonderful  incredible ideas that were always percolating  and so much of what's cool or hot today is really based on some of those concepts  whether it's  you know  people trying to use the prime directive from Star Trek being involved in things  or again that three dimensional weaving and fax machines that I read about in my weekly readers that the technology and engineering was just getting started. But the '  s left me with a problem. You see  I always assumed I would go into space  because I followed all of this  but I also loved the arts and sciences. You see  when I was growing up as a little girl and as a teenager  I loved designing and making dogs' clothes and wanting to be a fashion designer. I took art and ceramics. I loved dance. Lola Falana. Alvin Ailey. Jerome Robbins. And I also avidly followed the Gemini and the Apollo programs. I had science projects and tons of astronomy books. I took calculus and philosophy. I wondered about the infinity and the Big Bang theory. And when I was at Stanford  I found myself  my senior year  chemical engineering major  half the folks thought I was a political science and performing arts major  which was sort of true because I was Black Student Union President and I did major in some other things  and I found myself the last quarter juggling chemical engineering separation processes  logic classes  nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy  and also producing and choreographing a dance production  and I had to do the lighting and the design work  and I was trying to figure out  do I go to New York City to try to become a professional dancer  or do I go to medical school  Now  my mother helped me figure that one out.  Laughter  But when I went into space  when I went into space I carried a number of things up with me. I carried a poster by Alvin Ailey  which you can figure out now  I love the dance company. An Alvin Ailey poster of Judith Jamison performing the dance  Cry   dedicated to all black women everywhere. A Bundu statue  which was from the Women's Society in Sierra Leone  and a certificate for the Chicago Public School students to work to improve their science and math  and folks asked me   Why did you take up what you took up   And I had to say   Because it represents human creativity  the creativity that allowed us  that we were required to have to conceive and build and launch the space shuttle  springs from the same source as the imagination and analysis it took to carve a Bundu statue  or the ingenuity it took to design  choreograph  and stage  Cry.  Each one of them are different manifestations  incarnations  of creativity  avatars of human creativity  and that's what we have to reconcile in our minds  how these things fit together. The difference between arts and sciences is not analytical versus intuitive  right  E MC squared required an intuitive leap  and then you had to do the analysis afterwards. Einstein said  in fact   The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.  Dance requires us to express and want to express the jubilation in life  but then you have to figure out  exactly what movement do I do to make sure that it comes across correctly  The difference between arts and sciences is also not constructive versus deconstructive  right  A lot of people think of the sciences as deconstructive. You have to pull things apart. And yeah  sub atomic physics is deconstructive. You literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what's inside of them. But sculpture  from what I understand from great sculptors  is deconstructive  because you see a piece and you remove what doesn't need to be there. Biotechnology is constructive. Orchestral arranging is constructive. So in fact we use constructive and deconstructive techniques in everything. The difference between science and the arts is not that they are different sides of the same coin  even  or even different parts of the same continuum  but rather they're manifestations of the same thing. Different quantum states of an atom  Or maybe if I want to be more   st century I could say that they are different harmonic resonances of a superstring. But we'll leave that alone.  Laughter  They spring from the same source. The arts and sciences are avatars of human creativity. It's our attempt as humans to build an understanding of the universe  the world around us. It's our attempt to influence things  the universe internal to ourselves and external to us. The sciences  to me  are manifestations of our attempt to express or share our understanding  our experience  to influence the universe external to ourselves. It doesn't rely on us as individuals. It's the universe  as experienced by everyone  and the arts manifest our desire  our attempt to share or influence others through experiences that are peculiar to us as individuals. Let me say it again another way  science provides an understanding of a universal experience  and arts provides a universal understanding of a personal experience. That's what we have to think about  that they're all part of us  they're all part of a continuum. It's not just the tools  it's not just the sciences  you know  the mathematics and the numerical stuff and the statistics  because we heard  very much on this stage  people talked about music being mathematical. Right  Arts don't just use clay  aren't the only ones that use clay  light and sound and movement. They use analysis as well. So people might say  well  I still like that intuitive versus analytical thing  because everybody wants to do the right brain  left brain thing  right  We've all been accused of being right brained or left brained at some point in time  depending on who we disagreed with.  Laughter  You know  people say intuitive  you know that's like you're in touch with nature  in touch with yourself and relationships. Analytical  you put your mind to work  and I'm going to tell you a little secret. You all know this though  but sometimes people use this analysis idea  that things are outside of ourselves  to be  say  that this is what we're going to elevate as the true  most important sciences  right  And then you have artists  and you all know this is true as well  artists will say things about scientists because they say they're too concrete  they're disconnected with the world. But  we've even had that here on stage  so don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.  Laughter  We had folks talking about the Flat Earth Society and flower arrangers  so there's this whole dichotomy that we continue to carry along  even when we know better. And folks say we need to choose either or. But it would really be foolish to choose either one  right  Intuitive versus analytical  That's a foolish choice. It's foolish  just like trying to choose between being realistic or idealistic. You need both in life. Why do people do this  I'm just gonna quote a molecular biologist  Sydney Brenner  who's    years old so he can say this. He said   It's always important to distinguish between chastity and impotence.  Now...  Laughter  I want to share with you a little equation  okay  How do understanding science and the arts fit into our lives and what's going on and the things that we're talking about here at the design conference  and this is a little thing I came up with  understanding and our resources and our will cause us to have outcomes. Our understanding is our science  our arts  our religion  how we see the universe around us  our resources  our money  our labor  our minerals  those things that are out there in the world we have to work with. But more importantly  there's our will. This is our vision  our aspirations of the future  our hopes  our dreams  our struggles and our fears. Our successes and our failures influence what we do with all of those  and to me  design and engineering  craftsmanship and skilled labor  are all the things that work on this to have our outcome  which is our human quality of life. Where do we want the world to be  And guess what  Regardless of how we look at this  whether we look at arts and sciences are separate or different  they're both being influenced now and they're both having problems. I did a project called S.E.E.ing the Future  Science  Engineering and Education  and it was looking at how to shed light on most effective use of government funding. We got a bunch of scientists in all stages of their careers. They came to Dartmouth College  where I was teaching  and they talked about with theologians and financiers  what are some of the issues of public funding for science and engineering research  What's most important about it  There are some ideas that emerged that I think have really powerful parallels to the arts. The first thing they said was that the circumstances that we find ourselves in today in the sciences and engineering that made us world leaders is very different than the '  s  the '  s  and the '  s and the '  s when we emerged as world leaders  because we're no longer in competition with fascism  with Soviet style communism  and by the way that competition wasn't just military  it included social competition and political competition as well  that allowed us to look at space as one of those platforms to prove that our social system was better. Another thing they talked about was the infrastructure that supports the sciences is becoming obsolete. We look at universities and colleges  small  mid sized community colleges across the country  their laboratories are becoming obsolete  and this is where we train most of our science workers and our researchers  and our teachers  by the way  and then that there's a media that doesn't support the dissemination of any more than the most mundane and inane of information. There's pseudo science  crop circles  alien autopsy  haunted houses  or disasters. And that's what we see. And this isn't really the information you need to operate in everyday life and figure out how to participate in this democracy and determine what's going on. They also said that there's a change in the corporate mentality. Whereas government money had always been there for basic science and engineering research  we also counted on some companies to do some basic research  but what's happened now is companies put more energy into short term product development than they do in basic engineering and science research. And education is not keeping up. In K through     people are taking out wet labs. They think if we put a computer in the room it's going to take the place of actually  we're mixing the acids  we're growing the potatoes. And government funding is decreasing in spending and then they're saying  let's have corporations take over  and that's not true. Government funding should at least do things like recognize cost benefits of basic science and engineering research. We have to know that we have a responsibility as global citizens in this world. We have to look at the education of humans. We need to build our resources today to make sure that they're trained so that they understand the importance of these things  and we have to support the vitality of science  and that doesn't mean that everything has to have one thing that's going to go on  or we know exactly what's going to be the outcome of it  but that we support the vitality and the intellectual curiosity that goes along  and if you think about those parallels to the arts  the competition with the Bolshoi Ballet spurred the Joffrey and the New York City Ballet to become better. Infrastructure museums  theaters  movie houses across the country are disappearing. We have more television stations with less to watch  we have more money spent on rewrites to get old television programs in the movies. We have corporate funding now that  when it goes to some company  when it goes to support the arts  it almost requires that the product be part of the picture that the artist draws  and we have stadiums that are named over and over again by corporations. In Houston  we're trying to figure out what to do with that Enron Stadium thing. in the schools is disappearing  and we have a government that seems like it's gutting the NEA and other programs  so we have to really stop and think  what are we trying to do with the sciences and the arts  There's a need to revitalize them. We have to pay attention to it. I just want to tell you really quickly what I'm doing. I want to tell you what I've been doing a little bit since... I feel this need to sort of integrate some of the ideas that I've had and run across over time. One of the things that I found out is that there's a need to repair the dichotomy between the mind and body as well. My mother always told me  you have to be observant  know what's going on in your mind and your body  and as a dancer I had this tremendous faith in my ability to know my body  just as I knew how to sense colors. Then I went to medical school  and I was supposed to just go on what the machine said about bodies. You know  you would ask patients questions and some people would tell you   Don't  don't  don't listen to what the patients said.  We know that patients know and understand their bodies better  but these days we're trying to divorce them from that idea. We have to reconcile the patient's knowledge of their body with physician's measurements. We had someone talk about measuring emotions and getting machines to figure out what  to keep us from acting crazy. Right  No  we shouldn't measure  we shouldn't use machines to measure road rage and then do something to keep us from engaging in it. Maybe we can have machines help us to recognize that we have road rage and then we need to know how to control that without the machines. We even need to be able to recognize that without the machines. What I'm very concerned about is how do we bolster our self awareness as humans  as biological organisms  Michael Moschen spoke of having to teach and learn how to feel with my eyes  to see with my hands. We have all kinds of possibilities to use our senses by  and that's what we have to do. That's what I want to do  is to try to use bioinstrumentation  those kind of things to help our senses in what we do  and that's the work I've been doing now as a company called BioSentient Corporation. I figured I'd have to do that ad  because I'm an entrepreneur  because entrepreneur says that that's somebody who does what they want to do because they're not broke enough that they have to get a real job. with BioSentient Corporation trying to figure out how do we integrate these things  Let me finish by saying that my personal design issue for the future is really about integrating  to think about that intuitive and that analytical. The arts and sciences are not separate. High school physics lesson before you leave. High school physics teacher used to hold up a ball. She would say this ball has potential energy  but nothing will happen to it  it can't do any work until I drop it and it changes states. I like to think of ideas as potential energy. They're really wonderful  but nothing will happen until we risk putting them into action. This conference is filled with wonderful ideas. We're going to share lots of things with people  but nothing's going to happen until we risk putting those ideas into action. We need to revitalize the arts and sciences of today  we need to take responsibility for the future. We can't hide behind saying it's just for company profits  or it's just a business  or I'm an artist or an academician. Here's how you judge what you're doing. I talked about that balance between intuitive  analytical. Fran Lebowitz  my favorite cynic  she said the three questions of greatest concern  now I'm going to add on to design  is   Is it attractive   That's the intuitive.  Is it amusing   The analytical.  And does it know its place   The balance. Thank you very much. This is a sculpture I made  which is a way of  kind of  freeing a form into an object that has different degrees of freedom. So  it can balance on a point. This is a bronze ball  an aluminum arm here  and then this wooden disk. And the wooden disk was really thought about as something that you'd want to hold on to  and that would glide easily through your hands. The aluminum is because it's very light. The bronze is nice hard  durable material that could roll on the ground. Inside of the bronze ball there's a lead weight that is free swinging on an axle that's on two bearings that pass in between  across it  like this  that counterbalance this weight. So it allows it to roll. And the sphere has that balance property that it always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction. But if you put something on top of it  it disbalances it. And so it would tip over. But in this case because the interior is free swinging in relation to the sphere  it can stand up on one point. And then there was a second level to this object  which is that it    I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in  which is the diameter of the Moon and the diameter of the Earth in proportion to each other. I was exploring  really early on  wanting to make things float in the air. And I thought up a lot of ideas. This is sculpture that I made that    it's magnetically levitated. The thing is  is that it's slightly dangerous. Normally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum. But it's uh    let's see if I can manipulate it a little bit without  um    oops. So this is just floating  floating on a permanent magnetic field  which stabilizes it in all directions. Except there is a slight tether here  which keeps it from going over the top of its field. It's sort of surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave. And that's what supports the object and keeps it stable. I think we could roll the tape  admin. I have a sort of a collection of videos that I took of different installations  which I could narrate. This is a sculpture of the Sun and the Earth  in proportion. Representing that eight and a half minutes that it takes light and gravity to connect the two. So here is the Earth. It's a little less than a millimeter that was turned of solid bronze. And here is a similar sculpture. That's the Sun at that end. And then in a series of    balls  it reduces  proportionately    each ball and the spaces between them reduce proportionately  until they get down to this little Earth. This is in a sculpture park in Taejon. This one is about the Moon and then the distance to the Earth  in proportion also. This is a little stone ball  floating. As you can see the little tether  that it's also magnetically levitated. And then this is the first part of    this is     spheres  since the Sun is     times the diameter of the Earth. And so this is the size of the Sun. And then each of these little spheres is the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun. It's made up of    concentric shells. Each one has    spheres. This is in the courtyard of a twelfth century alchemist. I was thinking that the Sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist.  Laughter  So this  again  is on the subject    a slice from the equator of the Earth. And then the Moon in the center  and it's floating. And this is in France. This is in Sapporo. It's balancing on a shaft and a ball  right at the center of gravity  or just slightly above the center of gravity  which means that the lower half of the object is just a little bit more weighty. So you can see it rotating here. It weighs about a ton or over a ton. It's made of stainless steel  quite thick. But it's being balanced like that in equilibrium. It's susceptible to motion by the air currents. This is another species of work that I do. These are these arrays. These spheres are all suspended  but they have magnets horizontally in them that make them all like compasses. So all the red sides  for example  face one direction  south. And the blue side  the compliment  faces the other way. So as you turn around you're seeing different colors. This is based on the structure of a diamond. It was a diamond cell structure was the point of departure. And then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows between the atoms. And so I placed one more element of each one of them. These were white spheres. Then I had video projectors that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres. So they would catch parts of the images  and make sort of three dimensional color volumes  as you walk through it  through the object. This is something I did of a tactile communication system. It was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture  and then putting it into a communication system. This is an idea of moving a sculpture  a ball  that would be directed around the room by a computer. This is a clock I designed. It has Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Map edited here. It turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth. And then  this is like projects that are harder to build. This has a diamond bottomed lake. So it's a floating island with water  fresh water  that can fly from place to place. This would be grown  I suppose  with nanotechnology in the future sometime. In the course of doing my work I sort of have a broad range of interests. And some of it is just the idea of creating media    media as a sculpture  something that would keep the sculpture fresh and ever changing  by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of. And I had a lot of    always interested in the concept of a crystal ball. And the idea that you could see things inside of a crystal ball and predict the future    or a television set  where it's sort of like a magic box where anything can appear. I had thought about  a long time ago  in the late '  s    when I was just starting out  I was under the influence of thinking about Buckminster Fuller's grand project for an electric globe across from the United Nations    and other things that were happening  the space program at that time  and Whole Earth Catalog  things like that. I was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites. So if we could roll the next film here. This has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations. But this the current version of it  is a flying airship that is about    meters in diameter  about     feet in diameter. The whole surface of it is covered with    million diodes  red  blue  and green  that allow you to have a high resolution picture  visible in daylight. I came with a plan. I brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment to do a feasibility study  and they analyzed it  and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it. So we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen. This is the control room inside of the ship. The idea of this air genie is  it's something that can just transform and become anything. It's like a traveling show. It has speakers on it. And it has cameras over the surface of it. So it can see its environment  and then it can mimic its environment and disappear. Here the legs are retracting. The cabin is open or closed  as you like. It weighs about    tons. It has on board generators. It can generate about a million kilowatts  in order to be bright enough to be visible in daylight. The idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show. It really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting. There would be on board a crew of artists  musicians  that would allow the thing to become actually kind of a conscious object that would respond to the moment  and to interact as an entity that was aware  that could communicate. It's completely silent and nonpolluting. It has electric motors with a novel propulsion system. It could be interacted with large crowds in different ways. Primarily I would be interested in how it would interact with  say  going to a college campus  and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences  the world  the situation of the globe. The default image on the object would probably be a high resolution Earth image. But then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues  or migrations    all of the things that we're concerned with today. And then at night the idea is that it would be used as kind of a rave situation  where the people could cut loose  and the music and the lights  and everything. So it could land in a park  for example. Or this could represent a college green. And then it would have a corresponding website that would show the itinerary of this. And so interacting with the same kind of imagery. It would also be able to be an open code  so people could interact with it. It would be forum for people's ideas about what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type. So that's pretty much it. Okay. Thank you. Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap  which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower    states  has shrunk by    percent. But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice. The arctic ice cap is  in a sense  the beating heart of the global climate system. It expands in winter and contracts in summer. The next slide I show you will be a rapid fast forward of what's happened over the last    years. The permanent ice is marked in red. As you see  it expands to the dark blue    that's the annual ice in winter  and it contracts in summer. The so called permanent ice  five years old or older  you can see is almost like blood  spilling out of the body here. In    years it's gone from this  to this. This is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean  where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which  when it thaws  is turned into methane by microbes. Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere  that amount could double if we cross this tipping point. Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska  methane is actively bubbling up out of the water. Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter. Video  Whoa   Laughter  Al Gore  She's okay. The question is whether we will be. And one reason is  this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north. This is an annual melting river. But the volumes are much larger than ever. This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland. If you want to know how sea level rises from land base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea. These flows are increasing very rapidly. At the other end of the planet  Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet. Last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance. And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under sea islands  is particularly rapid in its melting. That's equal to    feet of sea level  as is Greenland. In the Himalayas  the third largest mass of ice  at the top you see new lakes  which a few years ago were glaciers.    percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow. In the Andes  this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city. The flows have increased. But when they go away  so does much of the drinking water. In California there has been a    percent decline in the Sierra snowpack. This is hitting the reservoirs. And the predictions  as you've read  are serious. This drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires. And the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate. Four times as many in the last    years as in the previous   . This is a completely unsustainable pattern. If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing. In the last five years we've added    million tons of CO  every    hours       million tons every day to the oceans. Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific  from the Americas  extending westward  and on either side of the Indian subcontinent  where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans. The biggest single cause of global warming  along with deforestation  which is    percent of it  is the burning of fossil fuels. Oil is a problem  and coal is the most serious problem. The United States is one of the two largest emitters  along with China. And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants. But we're beginning to see a sea change. Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed. However there is a political battle in our country. And the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal  which is an oxymoron. That image reminded me of something. Around Christmas  in my home in Tennessee  a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled. You probably saw it on the news. This  all over the country  is the second largest waste stream in America. This happened around Christmas. One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one. Video     Frosty the coal man is a jolly  happy soul. He's abundant here in America  and he helps our economy grow. Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday. He's affordable and adorable  and workers keep their pay. Al Gore  This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia. The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal. Video  Don Blankenship  Let me be clear about it. Al Gore  Nancy Pelosi  Harry Reid  they don't know what they're talking about. Al Gore  So the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns. This is one of them  part of one of them. Video  Actor  At COALergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business. That's why we've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal. The fact is  coal isn't dirty. We think it's clean    smells good  too. So don't worry about climate change. Leave that up to us. Video  Actor  Clean coal    you've heard a lot about it. So let's take a tour of this state of the art clean coal facility. Amazing  The machinery is kind of loud. But that's the sound of clean coal technology. And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming  the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything. Take a good long look  this is today's clean coal technology. Al Gore  Finally  the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge. Video  Narrator  America is in crisis    the economy  national security  the climate crisis. The thread that links them all  our addiction to carbon based fuels  like dirty coal and foreign oil. But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess. Repower America with     percent clean electricity within    years. A plan to put America back to work  make us more secure  and help stop global warming. Finally  a solution that's big enough to solve our problems. Repower America. Find out more. Al Gore  This is the last one. Video  Narrator  It's about repowering America. One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet. Man  Future's over here. Wind  sun  a new energy grid. Man     New investments to create high paying jobs. Narrator  Repower America. It's time to get real. Al Gore  There is an old African proverb that says   If you want to go quickly  go alone. If you want to go far  go together.  We need to go far  quickly. Thank you very much. I'm not at all a cook. So don't fear  this is not going to be a cooking demonstration. But I do want to talk to you about something that I think is dear to all of us. And that is bread    something which is as simple as our basic  most fundamental human staple. And I think few of us spend the day without eating bread in some form. Unless you're on one of these Californian low carb diets  bread is standard. Bread is not only standard in the Western diet. As I will show to you  it is actually the mainstay of modern life. So I'm going to bake bread for you. In the meantime I'm also talking to you  so my life is going to be complicated. Bear with me. First of all  a little bit of audience participation. I have two loaves of bread here. One is a supermarket standard  white bread  pre packaged  which I'm told is called a Wonderbread. I didn't know this word until I arrived. And this is more or less  a whole meal  handmade  small bakery loaf of bread. Here we go. I want to see a show of hands. Who prefers the whole meal bread  Okay let me do this differently. Is anybody preferring the Wonderbread at all  I have two tentative male hands. Okay  now the question is really  why is this so  And I think it is because we feel that this kind of bread really is about authenticity. It's about a traditional way of living. A way that is perhaps more real  more honest. This is an image from Tuscany  where we feel agriculture is still about beauty. And life is really  too. And this is about good taste  good traditions. Why do we have this image  Why do we feel that this is more true than this  Well I think it has a lot to do with our history. In the        years since agriculture evolved  most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists or they were closely related to food production. And we have this mythical image of how life was in rural areas in the past. Art has helped us to maintain that kind of image. It was a mythical past. Of course  the reality is quite different. These poor farmers working the land by hand or with their animals  had yield levels that are comparable to the poorest farmers today in West Africa. But we have  somehow  in the course of the last few centuries  or even decades  started to cultivate an image of a mythical  rural agricultural past. It was only     years ago that we had the advent of the Industrial Revolution. And while I'm starting to make some bread for you here  it's very important to understand what that revolution did to us. It brought us power. It brought us mechanization  fertilizers. And it actually drove up our yields. And even sort of horrible things  like picking beans by hand  can now be done automatically. All that is a real  great improvement  as we shall see. Of course we also  particularly in the last decade  managed to envelop the world in a dense chain of supermarkets  in a chain of global trade. And it means that you now eat products  which can come from all around the world. That is the reality of our modern life. Now you may prefer this loaf of bread. Excuse my hands but this is how it is. But actually the real relevant bread  historically  is this white Wonder loaf. And don't despise the white bread because it really  I think  symbolizes the fact that bread and food have become plentiful and affordable to all. And that is a feat that we are not really conscious of that much. But it has changed the world. This tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways and has a lot of problems has changed the world. So what is happening  Well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution with modernization of agriculture in the last few decades  since the     s  food availability  per head  in this world  has increased by    percent. And the world population in the meantime has doubled. That means that we have now more food available than ever before in human history. And that is the result  directly  of being so successful at increasing the scale and volume of our production. And this is true  as you can see  for all countries  including the so called developing countries. What happened to our bread in the meantime  As food became plentiful here  it also meant that we were able to decrease the number of people working in agriculture to something like  on average  in the high income countries  five percent or less of the population. In the U.S. only one percent of the people are actually farmers. And it frees us all up to do other things    to sit at TED meetings and not to worry about our food. That is  historically  a really unique situation. Never before has the responsibility to feed the world been in the hands of so few people. And never before have so many people been oblivious of that fact. So as food became more plentiful  bread became cheaper. And as it became cheaper  bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things. We added in more sugar. We add in raisins and oil and milk and all kinds of things to make bread  from a simple food into kind of a support for calories. And today  bread now is associated with obesity  which is very strange. It is the basic  most fundamental food that we've had in the last ten thousand years. Wheat is the most important crop    the first crop we domesticated and the most important crop we still grow today. But this is now this strange concoction of high calories. And that's not only true in this country  it is true all over the world. Bread has migrated to tropical countries  where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava. So bread has become from a main staple  a source of calories associated with obesity and also a source of modernity  of modern life. And the whiter the bread  in many countries  the better it is. So this is the story of bread as we know it now. But of course the price of mass production has been that we moved large scale. And large scale has meant destruction of many of our landscapes  destruction of biodiversity    still a lonely emu here in the Brazilian cerrado soybean fields. The costs have been tremendous    water pollution  all the things you know about  destruction of our habitats. What we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about. And this is where I have to query all of you. How many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals  How many of you actually can make a bread in this way  without starting with a bread machine or just some kind of packaged flavor  Can you actually bake bread  Do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs  We have become very removed from what our bread really is  which  again  evolutionarily speaking  is very strange. In fact not many of you know that our bread  of course  was not a European invention. It was invented by farmers in Iraq and Syria in particular. The tiny spike on the left to the center is actually the forefather of wheat. This is where it all comes from  and where these farmers who actually  ten thousand years ago  put us on the road of bread. Now it is not surprising that with this massification and large scale production  there is a counter movement that emerged    very much also here in California. The counter movement says   Let's go back to this. Let's go back to traditional farming. Let's go back to small scale  to farmers' markets  small bakeries and all that.  Wonderful. Don't we all agree  I certainly agree. I would love to go back to Tuscany to this kind of traditional setting  gastronomy  good food. But this is a fallacy. And the fallacy comes from idealizing a past that we have forgotten about. If we do this  if we want to stay with traditional small scale farming we are going  actually  to relegate these poor farmers and their husbands    among whom I have lived for many years  working without electricity and water  to try to improve their food production    we relegate them to poverty. What they want are implements to increase their production  something to fertilize the soil  something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market. We cannot just think that small scale is the solution to the world food problem. It's a luxury solution for us who can afford it  if you want to afford it. In fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this. If we say just small scale production  as is the tendency here  to go back to local food means that a poor man like Hans Rosling cannot even eat oranges anymore because in Scandinavia we don't have oranges. So local food production is out. But also we do not want to relegate to poverty in the rural areas. And we do not want to relegate the urban poor to starvation. So we must find other solutions. One of our problems is that world food production needs to increase very rapidly    doubling by about     . The main driver of that is actually meat. And meat consumption in Southeast Asia and China in particular is what drives the prices of cereals. That need for animal protein is going to continue. We can discuss alternatives in another talk  perhaps one day  but this is our driving force. So what can we do  Can we find a solution to produce more  Yes. But we need mechanization. And I'm making a real plea here. I feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer to work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice          times  just to plant a crop and weed it. You cannot ask people to work under these conditions. We need clever low key mechanization that avoids the problems of the large scale mechanization that we've had. So what can we do  We must feed three billion people in cities. We will not do that through small farmers' markets because these people have no small farmers' markets at their disposal. They have low incomes. And they benefit from cheap  affordable  safe and diverse food. That's what we must aim for in the next    to    years. But yes there are some solutions. And let me just do one simple conceptual thing  if I plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale. What you see is that we've started in the left hand corner with traditional agriculture  which was sort of small scale and low control. We've moved towards large scale and very high control. What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale    not just in terms of the scale of the fields  but in terms of the entire food network. That's where we should move. And the ultimate may be  but it doesn't apply to cereals  that we have entirely closed ecosystems    the horticultural systems right at the top left hand corner. So we need to think differently about agriculture science. Agriculture science for most people    and there are not many farmers among you here    has this name of being bad  of being about pollution  about large scale  about the destruction of the environment. That is not necessary. We need more science and not less. And we need good science. So what kind of science can we have  Well first of all I think we can do much better on the existing technologies. Use biotechnology where useful  particularly in pest and disease resistance. There are also robots  for example  who can recognize weeds with a resolution of half an inch. We have much cleverer irrigation. We do not need to spill the water if we don't want to. And we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of small scale and large scale. We need to think that land is multi functional. It has different functions. There are different ways in which we must use it    for residential  for nature  for agriculture purposes. And we also need to re examine livestock. Go regional and go to urban food systems. I want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements. I want to have horticulture and greenhouses on top of residential areas. And I want to use the energy that comes from those greenhouses and from the fermentation of crops to heat our residential areas. There are all kinds of ways we can do it. We cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture. But we can do a lot more. And the main thing that I would really ask all of you as you go back to your countries  or as you stay here  ask your government for an integrated food policy. Food is as important as energy  as security  as the environment. Everything is linked together. So we can do that. In fact in a densely populated country like the River Delta  where I live in the Netherlands  we have combined these functions. So this is not science fiction. We can combine things even in a social sense of making the rural areas more accessible to people    to house  for example  the chronically sick. There is all kinds of things we can do. But there is something you must do. It's not enough for me to say   Let's get more bold science into agriculture.  You must go back and think about your own food chain. Talk to farmers. When was the last time you went to a farm and talked to a farmer  Talk to people in restaurants. Understand where you are in the food chain  where your food comes from. Understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events. And that frees you up to do other things. And above all  to me  food is about respect. It's about understanding  when you eat  that there are also many people who are still in this situation  who are still struggling for their daily food. And the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have  to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution  is really not morally justified. We need to help to lift them out of poverty. We need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive. Never before  as I said  has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few. And never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap. And I think there is nobody else who has expressed better  to me  the idea that food  in the end  in our own tradition  is something holy. It's not about nutrients and calories. It's about sharing. It's about honesty. It's about identity. Who said this so beautifully was Mahatma Gandhi     years ago  when he spoke about bread. He did not speak about rice  in India. He said   To those who have to go without two meals a day  God can only appear as bread.  And so as I'm finishing my bread here    and I've been baking it  and I'll try not to burn my hands. Let me share with those of you here in the first row. Let me share some of the food with you. Take some of my bread. And as you eat it  and as you try it    please come and stand up. Have some of it. I want you to think that every bite connects you to the past and the future  to these anonymous farmers  that first bred the first wheat varieties  and to the farmers of today  who've been making this. And you don't even know who they are. Every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world. Everything makes us so privileged  that we can eat this food  that we don't struggle every day. And that  I think  evolutionarily speaking is unique. We've never had that before. So enjoy your bread. Eat it  and feel privileged. Thank you very much. So sometimes I get invited to give weird talks. I got invited to speak to the people who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes to perform at sporting events. Unfortunately I couldn't go. But it got me thinking about the fact that these guys  at least most of them  know what it is that they do for a living. What they do is they dress up as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events. Shortly after that I got invited to speak at the convention of the people who make balloon animals. And again  I couldn't go. But it's a fascinating group. They make balloon animals. There is a big schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals  but    they do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons. Sometimes they get in trouble  but not often. And the other thing about these guys is  they also know what they do for a living. They make balloon animals. But what do we do for a living  What exactly to the people watching this do every day  And I want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything. That we try to find a piece of the status quo    something that bothers us  something that needs to be improved  something that is itching to be changed    and we change it. We try to make big  permanent  important change. But we don't think about it that way. And we haven't spent a lot of time talking about what that process is like. And I've been studying it for a couple years. And I want to share a couple stories with you today. First  about a guy named Nathan Winograd. Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA. And what you may not know about the history of the SPCA is  it was founded to kill dogs and cats. Cities gave them a charter to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them. In a typical year four million dogs and cats were killed  most of them within    hours of being scooped off of the street. Nathan and his boss saw this  and they could not tolerate it. So they set out to make San Francisco a no kill city  create an entire city where every dog and cat  unless it was ill or dangerous  would be adopted  not killed. And everyone said it was impossible. Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance. And people from SPCAs and humane shelters around the country flew to San Francisco to testify against them    to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane. They persisted. And Nathan went directly to the community. He connected with people who cared about this  nonprofessionals  people with passion. And within just a couple years  San Francisco became the first no kill city  running no deficit  completely supported by the community. Nathan left and went to Tompkins County  New York    a place as different from San Francisco as you can be and still be in the United States. And he did it again. He went from being a glorified dogcatcher to completely transforming the community. And then he went to North Carolina and did it again. And he went to Reno and he did it again. And when I think about what Nathan did  and when I think about what people here do  I think about ideas. And I think about the idea that creating an idea  spreading an idea has a lot behind it. I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding  but what they do is  they take a light bulb and they smash it. Now there is a bunch of reasons for that  and stories about it. But one reason is because it indicates a change  from before to after. It is a moment in time. And I want to argue that we are living through and are right at the key moment of a change in the way ideas are created and spread and implemented. We started with the factory idea  that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory that could churn out change. We then went to the TV idea  that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece  if you could get on TV enough times  if you could buy enough ads  you could win. And now we're in this new model of leadership  where the way we make change is not by using money or power to lever a system  but by leading. So let me tell you about the three cycles. The first one is the factory cycle. Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea. It enables him to hire men who used to get paid    cents a day and pay them five dollars a day. Because he's got an efficient enough factory. Well with that sort of advantage you can churn out a lot of cars. You can make a lot of change. You can get roads built. You can change the fabric of an entire country. That the essence of what you're doing is you need ever cheaper labor  and ever faster machines. And the problem we've run into is  we're running out of both. Ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines. So we shift gears for a minute  and say   I know  television  advertising. Push push. Take a good idea and push it on the world. I have a better mousetrap. And if I can just get enough money to tell enough people  I'll sell enough.  And you can build an entire industry on that. If necessary you can put babies in your ads. If necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff. And if babies don't work  you can use doctors. But be careful. Because you don't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition  where you're talking about one thing instead of the other. This model requires you to act like the king  like the person in the front of the room throwing things to the peons in the back. That you are in charge  and you're going to tell people what to do next. The quick little diagram of it is  you're up here  and you are pushing it out to the world. This method    mass marketing    requires average ideas  because you're going to the masses  and plenty of ads. What we've done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea  hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause  hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate. And  unfortunately  it doesn't work so well anymore either. But there is good news around the corner    really good news. I call it the idea of tribes. What tribes are  is a very simple concept that goes back        years. It's about leading and connecting people and ideas. And it's something that people have wanted forever. Lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe  or a church tribe  having a work tribe  having a community tribe. But now  thanks to the internet  thanks to the explosion of mass media  thanks to a lot of other things that are bubbling through our society around the world  tribes are everywhere. The Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all. Instead what it's allowed is silos of interest. So you've got the red hat ladies over here. You've got the red hat triathletes over there. You've got the organized armies over here. You've got the disorganized rebels over here. You've got people in white hats making food. And people in white hats sailing boats. The point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them  because you want to be connected. That people on the fringes can find each other  connect and go somewhere. Every town that has a volunteer fire department understands this way of thinking. Now it turns out this is a legitimate non photoshopped photo. People I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon. And that what firemen do to train sometimes is they take a house that is going to be torn down  and they burn it down instead  and practice putting it out. But they always stop and take a picture. You know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one. They've got their own flag. They've got the eye patches. You can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe. And it turns out that it's tribes    not money  not factories    that can change our world  that can change politics  that can align large numbers of people. Not because you force them to do something against their will  but because they wanted to connect. That what we do for a living now  all of us  I think  is find something worth changing  and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes that spread the idea and spread the idea. And it becomes something far bigger than ourselves  it becomes a movement. So when Al Gore set out to change the world again  he didn't do it by himself. And he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads. He did it by creating a movement. Thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him  because he can't be in     or     or     cities in each night. You don't need everyone. What Kevin Kelley has taught us is you just need  I don't know  a thousand true fans    a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round. And that means that the idea you create  the product you create  the movement you create isn't for everyone  it's not a mass thing. That's not what this is about. What it's about instead is finding the true believers. It's easy to look at what I've said so far  and say   Wait a minute  I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader.  So here are two leaders. They don't have a lot in common. They're about the same age. But that's about it. What they did  though  is each in their own way  created a different way of navigating your way through technology. So some people will go out and get people to be on one team. And some people will get people to be on the other team. It also informs the decisions you make when you make products or services. You know  this is one of my favorite devices. But what a shame that it's not organized to help authors create movements. What would happen if  when you're using your Kindle  you could see the comments and quotes and notes from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment. Or from your book group. Or from your friends  or from the circle you want. What would happen if authors  or people with ideas could use version two  which comes out on Monday  and use it to organize people who want to talk about something. Now there is a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here. But let me just try a couple. The Beatles did not invent teenagers. They merely decided to lead them. That most movements  most leadership that we're doing is about finding a group that's disconnected but already has a yearning    not persuading people to want something they don't have yet. When Diane Hatz worked on  The Meatrix   her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated  she didn't invent the idea of being a vegan. She didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue. But she helped organize people  and helped turn it into a movement. Hugo Chavez did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of Venezuela. He merely led them. Bob Marley did not invent Rastafarians. He just stepped up and said   Follow me.  Derek Sivers invented CD Baby  which allowed independent musicians to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man    to have place to take the mission they already wanted to go to  and connect with each other. What all these people have in common is that they are heretics. That heretics look at the status quo and say   This will not stand. I can't abide this status quo. I am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward. I see what the status quo is  I don't like it.  That instead of looking at all the little rules and following each one of them  that instead of being what I call a sheepwalker    somebody who's half asleep  following instructions  keeping their head down  fitting in    every once in a while someone stands up and says   Not me.  Someone stands up and says   This one is important. We need to organize around it.  And not everyone will. But you don't need everyone. You just need a few people    who will look at the rules  realize they make no sense  and realize how much they want to be connected. So Tony Hsieh does not run a shoe store. Zappos isn't a shoe store. Zappos is the one  the only  the best there ever was place for people who are into shoes to find each other  to talk about their passion  to connect with people who care more about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow. It can be something as prosaic as shoes  and something as complicated as overthrowing a government. It's exactly the same behavior though. What it requires  as Geraldine Carter has discovered  is to be able to say   I can't do this by myself. But if I can get other people to join my Climb and Ride  then together we can get something that we all want. We're just waiting for someone to lead us.  Michelle Kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture. She doesn't do it by quietly building one house at a time. She does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it. By connecting a tribe of people who are desperate to be connected to each other. By leading a movement and making change. And around and around and around it goes. So three questions I'd offer you. The first one is  who exactly are you upsetting  Because if you're not upsetting anyone  you're not changing the status quo. The second question is  who are you connecting  Because for a lot of people  that's what they're in it for  the connections that are being made  one to the other. And the third one is  who are you leading  Because focusing on that part of it    not the mechanics of what you're building  but the who  and the leading part    is where change comes. So Blake  at Tom's Shoes  had a very simple idea.  What would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes I gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn't even own a pair of shoes   This is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus. It's a story of a product that tells a story. And as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes and someone says   What are those   You get to tell the story on Blake's behalf  on behalf of the people who got the shoes. And suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or     pairs of shoes. It's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes. My friend Red Maxwell has spent the last    years fighting against juvenile diabetes. Not fighting the organization that's fighting it    fighting with them  leading them  connecting them  challenging the status quo because it's important to him. And the people he surrounds himself with need the connection. They need the leadership. It makes a difference. You don't need permission from people to lead them. But in case you do  here it is  they're waiting  we're waiting for you to show us where to go next. So here is what leaders have in common. The first thing is  they challenge the status quo. They challenge what's currently there. The second thing is  they build a culture. A secret language  a seven second handshake  a way of knowing that you're in or out. They have curiosity. Curiosity about people in the tribe  curiosity about outsiders. They're asking questions. They connect people to one another. Do you know what people want more than anything  They want to be missed. They want to be missed the day they don't show up. They want to be missed when they're gone. And tribe leaders can do that. It's fascinating  because all tribe leaders have charisma  but you don't need charisma to become a leader. Being a leader gives you charisma. If you look and study the leaders who have succeeded  that's where charisma comes from    from the leading. Finally  they commit. They commit to the cause. They commit to the tribe. They commit to the people who are there. So I'd like you to do something for me. And I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out of hand. What I want you to do  it only takes    hours  is  create a movement. Something that matters. Start. Do it. We need it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. AIDS was discovered       the virus      . These Gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in      in the world  or how we estimate that it was. What we are showing here is    on this axis here  I'm showing percent of infected adults. And on this axis  I'm showing dollars per person in income. And the size of these bubbles  the size of the bubbles here  that shows how many are infected in each country  and the color is the continent. Now  you can see United States  in       had a very low percentage infected  but due to the big population  still a sizable bubble. There were quite many people infected in the United States. And  up there  you see Uganda. They had almost five percent infected  and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country  then. And they were probably the most infected country in the world. Now  what has happened  Now you have understood the graph and now  in the next    seconds  we will play the HIV epidemic in the world. But first  I have a new invention here. I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer. So  ready  steady  go  First  we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe. They went upwards like this. In Asia  the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand    they reached one to two percent. Then  Uganda started to turn back  whereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed  and some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency. Look  India got many infected  but had a low level. And almost the same happens here. See  Uganda coming down  Zimbabwe coming down  Russia went to one percent. In the last two to three years  we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world.    years it took. But  steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better  it's just that they have stopped getting worse. And it has    the steady state is  more or less  one percent of the adult world population is HIV infected. It means    to    million people  the whole of California    every person  that's more or less what we have today in the world. Now  let me make a fast replay of Botswana. Botswana    upper middle income country in southern Africa  democratic government  good economy  and this is what happened there. They started low  they skyrocketed  they peaked up there in       and now they are down. But they are falling only slowly  because in Botswana  with good economy and governance  they can manage to treat people. And if people who are infected are treated  they don't die of AIDS. These percentages won't come down because people can survive    to    years. So there's some problem with these metrics now. But the poorer countries in Africa  the low income countries down here  there the rates fall faster  of the percentage infected  because people still die. In spite of PEPFAR  the generous PEPFAR  all people are not reached by treatment  and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries  only    percent are left on treatment after two years. It's not realistic with lifelong treatment for everyone in the poorest countries. But it's very good that what is done is being done. But focus now is back on prevention. It is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it. Drugs is too costly    had we had the vaccine  or when we will get the vaccine  that's something more effective    but the drugs are very costly for the poor. Not the drug in itself  but the treatment and the care which is needed around it. So  when we look at the pattern  one thing comes out very clearly  you see the blue bubbles and people say HIV is very high in Africa. I would say  HIV is very different in Africa. You'll find the highest HIV rate in the world in African countries  and yet you'll find Senegal  down here    the same rate as United States. And you'll find Madagascar  and you'll find a lot of African countries about as low as the rest of the world. It's this terrible simplification that there's one Africa and things go on in one way in Africa. We have to stop that. It's not respectful  and it's not very clever to think that way. I had the fortune to live and work for a time in the United States. I found out that Salt Lake City and San Francisco were different. And so it is in Africa    it's a lot of difference. So  why is it so high  Is it war  No  it's not. Look here. War torn Congo is down there    two  three  four percent. And this is peaceful Zambia  neighboring country       percent. And there's good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo    they have two  three percent infected  and peaceful Zambia    much higher. There are now studies clearly showing that the wars are terrible  that rapes are terrible  but this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa. So  is it poverty  Well if you look at the macro level  it seems more money  more HIV. But that's very simplistic  so let's go down and look at Tanzania. I will split Tanzania in five income groups  from the highest income to the lowest income  and here we go. The ones with the highest income  the better off    I wouldn't say rich    they have higher HIV. The difference goes from    percent down to four percent  and it is even bigger among women. There's a lot of things that we thought  that now  good research  done by African institutions and researchers together with the international researchers  show that that's not the case. So  this is the difference within Tanzania. And  I can't avoid showing Kenya. Look here at Kenya. I've split Kenya in its provinces. Here it goes. See the difference within one African country    it goes from very low level to very high level  and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest. So  what is it then  Why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries  Well  it is more common with multiple partners  there is less condom use  and there is age disparate sex    that is  older men tend to have sex with younger women. We see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affected countries. But where are they situated  I will swap the bubbles to a map. Look  the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold    percent of the HIV infected. HIV exists all over the world. Look  you have bubbles all over the world here. Brazil has many HIV infected. Arab countries not so much  but Iran is quite high. They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran. India has many because they are many. Southeast Asia  and so on. But  there is one part of Africa    and the difficult thing is  at the same time  not to make a uniform statement about Africa  not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this  on one hand. On the other hand  try to say that this is not the case  because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now. UNAIDS have done good data available  finally  about the spread of HIV. It could be concurrency. It could be some virus types. It could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency. After all  if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex  the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in      . Don't jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on. But    and if you are in an unfavorable situation  more sexually transmitted diseases  it can be one in    . But what we think is that it could be concurrency. And what is concurrency  In Sweden  we have no concurrency. We have serial monogamy. Vodka  New Year's Eve    new partner for the spring. Vodka  Midsummer's Eve    new partner for the fall. Vodka    and it goes on like this  you know  And you collect a big number of exes. And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic    terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years. HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore  having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for HIV than others. Probably  it's a combination of this. And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this. You can get this chart  free. We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site. And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart  we will not only have the money  but we will also use the brain. Thank you very much. Let me talk about India through the evolution of ideas. Now I believe this is an interesting way of looking at it because in every society  especially an open democratic society  it's only when ideas take root that things change. Slowly ideas lead to ideology  lead to policies that lead to actions. In      this country went through a Great Depression  which led to all the ideas of the state and social security  and all the other things that happened in Roosevelt's time. In the     s we had the Reagan revolution  which lead to deregulation. And today  after the global economic crisis  there was a whole new set of rules about how the state should intervene. So ideas change states. And I looked at India and said  really there are four kinds of ideas which really make an impact on India. The first  to my mind  is what I call as  the ideas that have arrived.  These ideas have brought together something which has made India happen the way it is today. The second set of ideas I call  ideas in progress.  Those are ideas which have been accepted but not implemented yet. The third set of ideas are what I call as  ideas that we argue about     those are ideas where we have a fight  an ideological battle about how to do things. And the fourth thing  which I believe is most important  is  the ideas that we need to anticipate.  Because when you are a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having  you can actually anticipate what that did and do things very differently. Now in India's case I believe there are six ideas which are responsible for where it has come today. The first is really the notion of people. In the '  s and '  s we thought of people as a burden. We thought of people as a liability. Today we talk of people as an asset. We talk of people as human capital. And I believe this change in the mindset  of looking at people as something of a burden to human capital  has been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset. And this change in thinking of human capital is linked to the fact that India is going through a demographic dividend. As healthcare improves  as infant mortality goes down  fertility rates start dropping. And India is experiencing that. India is going to have a lot of young people with a demographic dividend for the next    years. What is unique about this demographic dividend is that India will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend. In other words  it will be the only young country in an aging world. And this is very important. At the same time if you peel away the demographic dividend in India  there are actually two demographic curves. One is in the south and in the west of India  which is already going to be fully expensed by       because in that part of the country  the fertility rate is almost equal to that of a West European country. Then there is the whole northern India  which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend. But a demographic dividend is only as good as the investment in your human capital. Only if the people have education  they have good health  they have infrastructure  they have roads to go to work  they have lights to study at night    only in those cases can you really get the benefit of a demographic dividend. In other words  if you don't really invest in the human capital  the same demographic dividend can be a demographic disaster. Therefore India is at a critical point where either it can leverage its demographic dividend or it can lead to a demographic disaster. The second thing in India has been the change in the role of entrepreneurs. When India got independence entrepreneurs were seen as a bad lot  as people who would exploit. But today  after    years  because of the rise of entrepreneurship  entrepreneurs have become role models  and they are contributing hugely to the society. This change has contributed to the vitality and the whole economy. The third big thing I believe that has changed India is our attitude towards the English language. English language was seen as a language of the imperialists. But today  with globalization  with outsourcing  English has become a language of aspiration. This has made it something that everybody wants to learn. And the fact that we have English is now becoming a huge strategic asset. The next thing is technology. Forty years back  computers were seen as something which was forbidding  something which was intimidating  something that reduced jobs. Today we live in a country which sells eight million mobile phones a month  of which    percent of those mobile phones are prepaid phones because people don't have credit history. Forty percent of those prepaid phones are recharged at less than    cents at each recharge. That is the scale at which technology has liberated and made it accessible. And therefore technology has gone from being seen as something forbidding and intimidating to something that is empowering. Twenty years back  when there was a report on bank computerization  they didn't name the report as a report on computers  they call them as  ledger posting machines.  They didn't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers. And when they wanted to have more advanced  more powerful computers they called them  advanced ledger posting machines.  So we have come a long way from those days where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment  and really has changed the way Indians think of technology. And then I think the other point is that Indians today are far more comfortable with globalization. Again  after having lived for more than     years under the East India Company and under imperial rule  Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization believing it was a form of imperialism. But today  as Indian companies go abroad  as Indians come and work all over the world  Indians have gained a lot more confidence and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in. And the fact that the demographics are in our favor  because we are the only young country in an aging world  makes globalization all the more attractive to Indians. And finally  India has had the deepening of its democracy. When democracy came to India    years back it was an elite concept. It was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy because they wanted to bring in the idea of universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth. But today democracy has become a bottom up process where everybody has realized the benefits of having a voice  the benefits of being in an open society. And therefore democracy has become embedded. I believe these six factors    the rise of the notion of population as human capital  the rise of Indian entrepreneurs  the rise of English as a language of aspiration  technology as something empowering  globalization as a positive factor  and the deepening of democracy    has contributed to why India is today growing at rates it has never seen before. But having said that  then we come to what I call as ideas in progress. Those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society  but you are not able to implement those things. And really there are four things here. One is the question of education. For some reason  whatever reason    lack of money  lack of priorities  because of religion having an older culture    primary education was never given the focus it required. But now I believe it's reached a point where it has become very important. Unfortunately the government schools don't function  so children are going to private schools today. Even in the slums of India more than    percent of urban kids are going into private schools. So there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work. But having said that  there is an enormous desire among everybody  including the poor  to educate their children. So I believe primary education is an idea which is arrived but not yet implemented. Similarly  infrastructure    for a long time  infrastructure was not a priority. Those of you who have been to India have seen that. It's certainly not like China. But today I believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement. It is reflected in the political statements.    years back the political slogan was   Roti  kapada  makaan   which meant   Food  clothing and shelter.  And today's political slogan is   Bijli  sadak  pani   which means  Electricity  water and roads.  And that is a change in the mindset where infrastructure is now accepted. So I do believe this is an idea which has arrived  but simply not implemented. The third thing is again cities. It's because Gandhi believed in villages and because the British ruled from the cities  therefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un Indian city. For a long time we have neglected our cities. And that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see. But today  finally  after economic reforms  and economic growth  I think the notion that cities are engines of economic growth  cities are engines of creativity  cities are engines of innovation  have finally been accepted. And I think now you're seeing the move towards improving our cities. Again  an idea which is arrived  but not yet implemented. The final thing is the notion of India as a single market    because when you didn't think of India as a market  you didn't really bother about a single market  because it didn't really matter. And therefore you had a situation where every state had its own market for products. Every province had its own market for agriculture. Increasingly now the policies of taxation and infrastructure and all that  are moving towards creating India as a single market. So there is a form of internal globalization which is happening  which is as important as external globalization. These four factors I believe    the ones of primary education  infrastructure  urbanization  and single market    in my view are ideas in India which have been accepted  but not implemented. Then we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict. The ideas that we argue about. These are the arguments we have which cause gridlock. What are those ideas  One is  I think  are ideological issues. Because of the historical Indian background  in the caste system  and because of the fact that there have been many people who have been left out in the cold  a lot of the politics is about how to make sure that we'll address that. And it leads to reservations and other techniques. It's also related to the way that we subsidize our people  and all the left and right arguments that we have. A lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology of caste and other things. This policy is causing gridlock. This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved. The second one is the labor policies that we have  which make it so difficult for entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies  that    percent of Indian labor is in the unorganized sector. They have no benefits  they don't have social security  they don't have pension  they don't have healthcare  none of those things. This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people into the formal workforce  you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised. Therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws  which are not as onerous as they are today. At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector  and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for. The third thing is our higher education. Indian higher education is completely regulated. It's very difficult to start a private university. It's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India. As a result of that our higher education is simply not keeping pace with India's demands. That is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address. But most important I believe are the ideas we need to anticipate. Here India can look at what is happening in the west and elsewhere  and look at what needs to be done. The first thing is  we're very fortunate that technology is at a point where it is much more advanced than when other countries had the development. So we can use technology for governance. We can use technology for direct benefits. We can use technology for transparency  and many other things. The second thing is  the health issue. India has equally horrible health problems of the higher state of cardiac issue  the higher state of diabetes  the higher state of obesity. So there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases with a set of rich country diseases. Therefore we're to rethink the whole way we look at health. We really need to put in place a strategy so that we don't go to the other extreme of health. Similarly today in the West you're seeing the problem of entitlement    the cost of social security  the cost of Medicare  the cost of Medicaid. Therefore when you are a young country  again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system so that you don't create entitlement problems as you grow old. And then again  India does not have the luxury of making its environment dirty  because it has to marry environment and development. Just to give an idea  the world has to stabilize at something like    gigatons per year. On a population of nine billion our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year. India is already at two tons per year. But if India grows at something like eight percent  income per year per person will go to    times by     . So we're saying  income growing at    times and no growth in carbon. Therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment  the way we look at energy  the way we create whole new paradigms of development. Now why does this matter to you  Why does what's happening    thousand miles away matter to all of you  Number one  this matters because this represents more than a billion people. A billion people     th of the world population. It matters because this is a democracy. And it is important to prove that growth and democracy are not incompatible  that you can have a democracy  that you can have an open society  and you can have growth. It's important because if you solve these problems  you can solve the problems of poverty in the world. It's important because you need it to solve the world's environment problems. If we really want to come to a point  we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission  we want to really lower the use of energy    it has to be solved in countries like India. You know if you look at the development in the West over     years  the average growth may have been about two percent. Here we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent. And that makes a huge difference. When India was growing at about three   .  percent and the population was growing at two percent  its per capita income was doubling every    years. When the economic growth goes to eight percent and population growth drops to  .  percent  then per capita income is doubling every nine years. In other words  you're certainly fast forwarding this whole process of a billion people going to prosperity. And you must have a clear strategy which is important for India and important for the world. That is why I think all of you should be equally concerned with it as I am. Thank you very much.   I think I'm ready to do my thing     I think I'm ready to take my chances     I've been dining out and all stressed out     Due to the circumstances.

Believe me or not  I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem  with the requisite focus on climate. And the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind  and the resulting decline of the biosphere. That culprit is business and industry  which happens to be where I have spent the last    years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in     . As an industrial engineer  cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur. After founding my company  Interface  from scratch in          years ago  to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets  and shepherding it through start up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field  I read Paul Hawken's book   The Ecology of Commerce   the summer of     . In his book  Paul charges business and industry as  one  the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere  and  two  the only institution that is large enough  and pervasive enough  and powerful enough  to really lead humankind out of this mess. And by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth. And I then challenged the people of Interface  my company  to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability  which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth  naturally and rapidly    not another fresh drop of oil    and to do no harm to the biosphere. Take nothing  do no harm. I simply said   If Hawken is right and business and industry must lead  who will lead business and industry  Unless somebody leads  nobody will.  It's axiomatic. Why not us  And thanks to the people of Interface  I have become a recovering plunderer. I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail. And that became the headline of a Fortune article. They went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO. From plunderer to recovering plunderer  to America's greenest CEO in five years    that  frankly  was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in     . Asked later in the Canadian documentary   The Corporation   what I meant by the  go to jail  remark  I offered that theft is a crime. And theft of our children's future would someday be a crime. But I realized  for that to be true    for theft of our children's future to be a crime    there must be a clear  demonstrable alternative to the take make waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization  and is the major culprit  stealing our children's future  by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator    in short  digging up the earth and converting it to pollution. According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich and a well known environmental impact equation  impact    a bad thing    is the product of population  affluence and technology. That is  impact is generated by people  what they consume in their affluence  and how it is produced. And though the equation is largely subjective  you can perhaps quantify people  and perhaps quantify affluence  but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify. So the equation is conceptual. Still it works to help us understand the problem. So we set out at Interface  in       to create an example  to transform the way we made carpet  a petroleum intensive product for materials as well as energy  and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact  rather than multiplied it. Paul and Anne Ehrlich's environmental impact equation  I is equal to P times A times T  population  affluence and technology. I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read I equals P times A divided by T. Now  the mathematically minded will see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact    a bad thing    but T in the denominator decreases impact. So I ask   What would move T  technology  from the numerator    call it T     where it increases impact  to the denominator    call it T     where it reduces impact  I thought about the characteristics of first industrial revolution  T   as we practiced it at Interface  and it had the following characteristics. Extractive  taking raw materials from the earth. Linear  take  make  waste. Powered by fossil fuel derived energy. Wasteful  abusive and focused on labor productivity. More carpet per man hour. Thinking it through  I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move T to the denominator. In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable  linear by cyclical  fossil fuel energy by renewable energy  sunlight  wasteful by waste free  and abusive by benign  and labor productivity by resource productivity. And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes  and get rid of T  altogether  we could reduce our impact to zero  including our impact on the climate. And that became the Interface plan in       and has been the plan ever since. We have measured our progress very rigorously. So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing    years. Net greenhouse gas emissions down    percent in absolute tonnage. Over the same span of time sales have increased by two thirds and profits have doubled. So an    percent absolute reduction translates into a    percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales. This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by      to avoid catastrophic climate disruption    so the scientists are telling us. Fossil fuel usage is down    percent per unit of production  due to efficiencies in renewables. The cheapest  most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies. Water usage is down    percent in our worldwide carpet tile business. Down    percent in our broadloom carpet business  which we acquired in      right here in California  City of Industry  where water is so precious. Renewable or recyclable materials are    percent of the total  and growing rapidly. Renewable energy is    percent of our total  going for     percent. We have diverted     million pounds    that's        tons    of used carpet from landfills  closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started    years ago. Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold    million square yards of climate neutral carpet since       meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain  from mine and well head clear to end of life reclamation    independent third party certified. We call it Cool Carpet. And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator  increasing sales and profits. Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home  under the brand Flor  misspelled F L O R. You can point and click today at Flor.com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days. It is practical  and pretty too. We reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal  zero impact  zero footprint. We've set      as our target year for zero  for reaching the top  the summit of Mount Sustainability. We call this Mission Zero. And this is perhaps the most important facet  we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business. A better business model  a better way to bigger profits. Here is the business case for sustainability. From real life experience  costs are down  not up  reflecting some     million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste    the first face of Mount Sustainability. This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface. And this dispels a myth too  this false choice between the environment and the economy. Our products are the best they've ever been  inspired by design for sustainability  an unexpected wellspring of innovation. Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose. You cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together. And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing. No amount of advertising  no clever marketing campaign  at any price  could have produced or created this much goodwill. Costs  products  people  marketplaces    what else is there  It is a better business model. And here is our    year record of sales and profits. There is a dip there  from      to       a dip when our sales  over a three year period  were down    percent. But the marketplace was down    percent. We literally gained market share. We might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability. If every business were pursuing Interface plans  would that solve all our problems  I don't think so. I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation  I equals P times A divided by T . That A is a capital A  suggesting that affluence is an end in itself. But what if we reframed Ehrlich further  And what if we made A a lowercase 'a ' suggesting that it is a means to an end  and that end is happiness    more happiness with less stuff. You know that would reframe civilization itself    and our whole system of economics  if not for our species  then perhaps for the one that succeeds us  the sustainable species  living on a finite earth  ethically  happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations  or        generations    that is to say  into the indefinite future. But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species  Well maybe so. But I don't think so. At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable  zero footprint industrial company fully into existence by     . We can see our way now  clear to the top of that mountain. And now the challenge is in execution. And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says   If something exists  it must be possible.  If we can actually do it  it must be possible. If we  a petro intensive company can do it  anybody can. And if anybody can  it follows that everybody can. Hawken fulfilled business and industry  leading humankind away from the abyss because  with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere  a very dear person is at risk here    frankly  an unacceptable risk. Who is that person  Not you. Not I. But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here. And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb. On a Tuesday morning in March of       I was talking to people  as I did at every opportunity back then  bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting. But about five days later back in Atlanta  I received an email from Glenn Thomas  one of my people in the California meeting. He was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together. And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life. Because it told me  by God  one person got it. Here is what Glenn wrote. And here is that person  most at risk. Please meet  Tomorrow's Child.   Without a name  an unseen face  and knowing not your time or place  Tomorrow's child  though yet unborn  I met you first last Tuesday morn. A wise friend introduced us two. And through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see  a day for you but not for me. Knowing you has changed my thinking. For I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday  somehow threaten you. Tomorrow's child  my daughter  son  I'm afraid I've just begun to think of you and of your good  though always having known I should. Begin  I will. The way the cost of what I squander  what is lost  if ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too.  Well  every day of my life since   Tomorrow's Child  has spoken to me with one simple but profound message  which I presume to share with you. We are  each and every one  a part of the web of life. The continuum of humanity  sure  but in a larger sense  the web of life itself. And we have a choice to make during our brief  brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet  to hurt it or to help it. For you  it's your call. Thank you. I'll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior. Not yours  of course    other people's. So after being at MIT for a few years  I realized that writing academic papers is not that exciting. You know  I don't know how many of those you read  but it's not fun to read and often not fun to write    even worse to write. So I decided to try and write something more fun. And I came up with an idea that I would write a cookbook. And the title for my cookbook was going to be   Dining Without Crumbs  The Art of Eating Over the Sink.  And it was going to be a look at life through the kitchen. I was quite excited about this. I was going to talk a little bit about research  a little bit about the kitchen. We do so much in the kitchen  I thought this would be interesting. I wrote a couple of chapters  and took it to MIT Press and they said   Cute  but not for us. Go and find somebody else.  I tried other people  and everybody said the same thing   Cute. Not for us.  Until somebody said   Look  if you're serious about this  you have to write about your research first  you have to publish something  then you'll get the opportunity to write something else. If you really want to do it  you have to do it.  I said   I don't want to write about my research. I do it all day long  I want to write something a bit more free  less constrained.  And this person was very forceful and said   Look  that's the only way you'll ever do it.  So I said   Okay  if I have to do it     I had a sabbatical. I said   I'll write about my research  if there's no other way. And then I'll get to do my cookbook.  So  I wrote a book on my research. And it turned out to be quite fun in two ways. First of all  I enjoyed writing. But the more interesting thing was that I started learning from people. It's a fantastic time to write  because there's so much feedback you can get from people. People write to me about their personal experience  and about their examples  and where they disagree  and their nuances. And even being here    I mean  the last few days  I've known heights of obsessive behavior I never thought about. Which I think is just fascinating. I will tell you a little bit about irrational behavior  and I want to start by giving you some examples of visual illusion as a metaphor for rationality. So think about these two tables. And you must have seen this illusion. If I asked you what's longer  the vertical line on the table on the left  or the horizontal line on the table on the right  which one seems longer  Can anybody see anything but the left one being longer  No  right  It's impossible. But the nice thing about visual illusion is we can easily demonstrate mistakes. So I can put some lines on  it doesn't help. I can animate the lines. And to the extent you believe I didn't shrink the lines  which I didn't  I've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you. Now  the interesting thing about this is when I take the lines away  it's as if you haven't learned anything in the last minute. You can't look at this and say   Now I see reality as it is.  Right  It's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer. Our intuition is really fooling us in a repeatable  predictable  consistent way. and there is almost nothing we can do about it  aside from taking a ruler and starting to measure it. Here's another one. It's one of my favorite illusions. What color is the top arrow pointing to  Audience  Brown. Dan Ariely  Brown. Thank you. The bottom one  Yellow. Turns out they're identical. Can anybody see them as identical  Very  very hard. I can cover the rest of the cube up. If I cover the rest of the cube  you can see that they are identical. If you don't believe me  you can get the slide later and do some arts and crafts and see that they're identical. But again  it's the same story  that if we take the background away  the illusion comes back. There is no way for us not to see this illusion. I guess maybe if you're colorblind  I don't think you can see that. I want you to think about illusion as a metaphor. Vision is one of the best things we do. We have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision    bigger than dedicated to anything else. We use our vision more hours of the day than anything else. We're evolutionarily designed to use vision. And if we have these predictable repeatable mistakes in vision  which we're so good at  what are the chances we won't make even more mistakes in something we're not as good at  for example  financial decision making. Something we don't have an evolutionary reason to do  we don't have a specialized part of the brain for  and we don't do that many hours of the day. The argument is in those cases  it might be that we actually make many more mistakes. And worse    not having an easy way to see them  because in visual illusions  we can easily demonstrate the mistakes  in cognitive illusion it's much  much harder to demonstrate the mistakes to people. So I want to show you some cognitive illusions  or decision making illusions  in the same way. And this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences. It's from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein. It basically shows the percentage of people who indicated they would be interested in donating their organs. These are different countries in Europe. You basically see two types of countries  countries on the right  that seem to be giving a lot  and countries on the left that seem to giving very little  or much less. The question is  why  Why do some countries give a lot and some countries give a little  When you ask people this question  they usually think that it has to be about culture. How much do you care about people  Giving organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society  how linked you are. Or maybe it's about religion. But if you look at this plot  you can see that countries that we think about as very similar  actually exhibit very different behavior. For example  Sweden is all the way on the right  and Denmark  which we think is culturally very similar  is all the way on the left. Germany is on the left  and Austria is on the right. The Netherlands is on the left  and Belgium is on the right. And finally  depending on your particular version of European similarity  you can think about the U.K. and France as either similar culturally or not  but it turns out that with organ donation  they are very different. By the way  the Netherlands is an interesting story. You see  the Netherlands is kind of the biggest of the small group. It turns out that they got to    percent after mailing every household in the country a letter  begging people to join this organ donation program. You know the expression   Begging only gets you so far.  It's    percent in organ donation. But whatever the countries on the right are doing  they're doing a much better job than begging. So what are they doing  Turns out the secret has to do with a form at the DMV. And here is the story. The countries on the left have a form at the DMV that looks something like this.  Check the box below if you want to participate in the organ donor program.  And what happens  People don't check  and they don't join. The countries on the right  the ones that give a lot  have a slightly different form. It says   Check the box below if you don't want to participate ...  Interestingly enough  when people get this  they again don't check  but now they join. Now  think about what this means. You know  we wake up in the morning and we feel we make decisions. We wake up in the morning and we open the closet  we feel that we decide what to wear. we open the refrigerator and we feel that we decide what to eat. What this is actually saying  is that many of these decisions are not residing within us. They are residing in the person who is designing that form. When you walk into the DMV  the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you'll end up doing. Now  it's also very hard to intuit these results. Think about it for yourself. How many of you believe that if you went to renew your license tomorrow  and you went to the DMV  and you encountered one of these forms  that it would actually change your own behavior  Very hard to think that it would influence us. We can say   Oh  these funny Europeans  of course it would influence them.  But when it comes to us  we have such a feeling that we're in the driver's seat  such a feeling that we're in control and we are making the decision  that it's very hard to even accept the idea that we actually have an illusion of making a decision  rather than an actual decision. Now  you might say   These are decisions we don't care about.  In fact  by definition  these are decisions about something that will happen to us after we die. How could we care about something less than about something that happens after we die  So a standard economist  somebody who believes in rationality  would say   You know what  The cost of lifting the pencil and marking a  V  is higher than the possible benefit of the decision  so that's why we get this effect.  But  in fact  it's not because it's easy. It's not because it's trivial. It's not because we don't care. It's the opposite. It's because we care. It's difficult and it's complex. And it's so complex that we don't know what to do. And because we have no idea what to do  we just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us. I'll give you one more example. This is from a paper by Redelmeier and Shafir. And they said   Would this effect also happens to experts  People who are well paid  experts in their decisions  and who make a lot of them   And they took a group of physicians. They presented to them a case study of a patient. They said   Here is a patient. He is a    year old farmer. He's been suffering from right hip pain for a while.  And then  they said to the physicians   You decided a few weeks ago that nothing is working for this patient. All these medications  nothing seems to be working. So you refer the patient for hip replacement therapy. Hip replacement. Okay   So the patient is on a path to have his hip replaced. Then they said to half of the physicians   Yesterday  you reviewed the patient's case  and you realized that you forgot to try one medication. You did not try ibuprofen. What do you do  Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen  Or do you let him go and have hip replacement   Well  the good news is that most physicians in this case decided to pull the patient and try ibuprofen. Very good for the physicians. To the other group of physicians  they said   Yesterday when you reviewed the case  you discovered there were two medications you didn't try out yet    ibuprofen and piroxicam.  You have two medications you didn't try out yet. What do you do  You let him go  or you pull him back  And if you pull him back  do you try ibuprofen or piroxicam  Which one   Now  think of it  This decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement  but pulling him back  all of the sudden it becomes more complex. There is one more decision. What happens now  The majority of the physicians now choose to let the patient go for a hip replacement. I hope this worries you  by the way    when you go to see your physician. The thing is that no physician would ever say   Piroxicam  ibuprofen  hip replacement. Let's go for hip replacement.  But the moment you set this as the default  it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing. I'll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision making. Imagine I give you a choice  Do you want to go for a weekend to Rome  all expenses paid    hotel  transportation  food  a continental breakfast  everything    or a weekend in Paris  Now  weekend in Paris  weekend in Rome    these are different things. They have different food  different culture  different art. Imagine I added a choice to the set that nobody wanted. Imagine I said   A weekend in Rome  a weekend in Paris  or having your car stolen   It's a funny idea  because why would having your car stolen  in this set  influence anything  But what if the option to have your car stolen was not exactly like this  What if it was a trip to Rome  all expenses paid  transportation  breakfast  but it doesn't include coffee in the morning  If you want coffee  you have to pay for it yourself  it's two euros   . Now in some ways  given that you can have Rome with coffee  why would you possibly want Rome without coffee  It's like having your car stolen. It's an inferior option. But guess what happened  The moment you add Rome without coffee  Rome with coffee becomes more popular  and people choose it. The fact that you have Rome without coffee makes Rome with coffee look superior  and not just to Rome without coffee    even superior to Paris. Here are two examples of this principle. This was an ad in The Economist a few years ago that gave us three choices  an online subscription for    dollars  a print subscription for     dollars  or you could get both for    . Now I looked at this  and I called up The Economist  and I tried to figure out what they were thinking. And they passed me from one person to another to another  until eventually I got to the person who was in charge of the website  and I called them up  and they went to check what was going on. The next thing I know  the ad is gone  no explanation. So I decided to do the experiment that I would have loved The Economist to do with me. I took this and I gave it to     MIT students. I said   What would you choose   These are the market shares    most people wanted the combo deal. Thankfully  nobody wanted the dominant option. That means our students can read. But now  if you have an option that nobody wants  you can take it off  right  So I printed another version of this  where I eliminated the middle option. I gave it to another     students. Here is what happened  Now the most popular option became the least popular  and the least popular became the most popular. What was happening was the option that was useless  in the middle  was useless in the sense that nobody wanted it. But it wasn't useless in the sense that it helped people figure out what they wanted. In fact  relative to the option in the middle  which was get only the print for      the print and web for     looked like a fantastic deal. And as a consequence  people chose it. The general idea here  by the way  is that we actually don't know our preferences that well. And because we don't know our preferences that well  we're susceptible to all of these influences from the external forces  the defaults  the particular options that are presented to us  and so on. One more example of this. People believe that when we deal with physical attraction  we see somebody  and we know immediately whether we like them or not  if we're attracted or not. This is why we have these four minute dates. So I decided to do this experiment with people. I'll show you images here  no real people  but the experiment was with people. I showed some people a picture of Tom  and a picture of Jerry. and I said   Who do you want to date  Tom or Jerry   But for half the people  I added an ugly version of Jerry. I took Photoshop and I made Jerry slightly less attractive. For the other people  I added an ugly version of Tom. And the question was  will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom help their respective  more attractive brothers  The answer was absolutely yes. When ugly Jerry was around  Jerry was popular. When ugly Tom was around  Tom was popular. This of course has two very clear implications for life in general. If you ever go bar hopping  who do you want to take with you  You want a slightly uglier version of yourself. Similar  but slightly uglier. The second point  or course  is that if somebody invites you to bar hop  you know what they think about you. Now you get it. What is the general point  The general point is that  when we think about economics  we have this beautiful view of human nature.  What a piece of work is a man  How noble in reason   We have this view of ourselves  of others. The behavioral economics perspective is slightly less  generous  to people  in fact  in medical terms  that's our view. But there is a silver lining. The silver lining is  I think  kind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting. Are we Superman  or are we Homer Simpson  When it comes to building the physical world  we kind of understand our limitations. We build steps. And we build these things that not everybody can use  obviously. We understand our limitations  and we build around them. But for some reason  when it comes to the mental world  when we design things like healthcare and retirement and stock markets  we somehow forget the idea that we are limited. I think that if we understood our cognitive limitations in the same way we understand our physical limitations  even though they don't stare us in the face the same way  we could design a better world  and that  I think  is the hope of this thing. Thank you very much. Alright. I'm going to show you a couple of images from a very diverting paper in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine. I'm going to go way out on a limb and say that it is the most diverting paper ever published in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine. The title is  Observations of In Utero Masturbation.  Okay. Now on the left you can see the hand    that's the big arrow    and the penis on the right. The hand hovering. And over here we have  in the words of radiologist Israel Meisner   The hand grasping the penis in a fashion resembling masturbation movements.  Bear in mind this was an ultrasound  so it would have been moving images. Orgasm is a reflex of the autonomic nervous system. Now  this is the part of the nervous system that deals with the things that we don't consciously control  like digestion  heart rate and sexual arousal. And the orgasm reflex can be triggered by a surprisingly broad range of input. Genital stimulation. Duh. But also  Kinsey interviewed a woman who could be brought to orgasm by having someone stroke her eyebrow. People with spinal cord injuries  like paraplegias  quadriplegias  will often develop a very  very sensitive area right above the level of their injury  wherever that is. There is such a thing as a knee orgasm in the literature. I think the most curious one that I came across was a case report of a woman who had an orgasm every time she brushed her teeth. Something in the complex sensory motor action of brushing her teeth was triggering orgasm. And she went to a neurologist  who was fascinated. He checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste  but no    it happened with any brand. They stimulated her gums with a toothpick  to see if that was doing it. No. It was the whole  you know  motion. And the amazing thing to me is that you would think this woman would have excellent oral hygiene. Sadly    this is what it said in the journal paper     She believed that she was possessed by demons and switched to mouthwash for her oral care.  It's so sad. When I was working on the book  I interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm. She was part of a study at Rutgers University. You've got to love that. Rutgers. So I interviewed her in Oakland  in a sushi restaurant. And I said   So  could you do it right here   And she said   Yeah  but you know I'd rather finish my meal if you don't mind.  But afterwards  she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside. It was remarkable. It took about one minute. And I said to her   Are you just doing this all the time   She said   No. Honestly  when I get home  I'm usually too tired.  She said that the last time she had done it was on the Disneyland tram. The headquarters for orgasm  along the spinal nerve  is something called the sacral nerve root  which is back here. And if you trigger  if you stimulate with an electrode  the precise spot  you will trigger an orgasm. And it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people    a certain kind of dead person  a beating heart cadaver. Now this is somebody who is brain dead  legally dead  definitely checked out  but is being kept alive on a respirator  so that their organs will be oxygenated for transplantation. Now in one of these brain dead people  if you trigger the right spot  you will see something every now and then. There is a reflex called the Lazarus reflex. And this is    I'll demonstrate as best I can  not being dead. It's like this. You trigger the spot. The dead guy  or gal  goes... like that. Very unsettling for people working in pathology labs. Now  if you can trigger the Lazarus reflex in a dead person  why not the orgasm reflex  I asked this question to a brain death expert  Stephanie Mann  who was foolish enough to return my emails. I said   So  could you conceivably trigger an orgasm in a dead person   She said   Yes  if the sacral nerve is being oxygenated  you conceivably could.  Obviously it wouldn't be as much fun for the person. But it would be an orgasm    nonetheless. There is a researcher at the University of Alabama who does orgasm research. I said to her   You should do an experiment. You know  You can get cadavers if you work at a university.  I said   You should actually do this.  She said   You get the human subjects review board approval for this one.  According to     s marriage manual author  Theodoor van De Velde  a slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman within about an hour after sexual intercourse. Theodoor van De Velde was something of a semen connoisseur. This is a guy writing a book   Ideal Marriage   you know. Very heavy hetero guy. But he wrote in this book   Ideal Marriage     he said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man  which he said had a fresh  exhilarating smell  and the semen of mature men  whose semen smelled  quote   Remarkably like that of the flowers of the Spanish chestnut. Sometimes quite freshly floral  and then again sometimes extremely pungent.  Okay. In       in the state of Israel  a man began hiccupping. And this was one of those cases that went on and on. He tried everything his friends suggested. Nothing seemed to help. Days went by. At a certain point  the man  still hiccupping  had sex with his wife. And lo and behold  the hiccups went away. He told his doctor  who published a case report in a Canadian medical journal under the title   Sexual Intercourse as a Potential Treatment for Intractable Hiccups.  I love this article because at a certain point they suggested that unattached hiccuppers could try masturbation. I love that because there is like a whole demographic  unattached hiccuppers. Married  single  unattached hiccupper. In the     s  early     s  a lot of gynecologists believed that when a woman has an orgasm  the contractions serve to suck the semen up through the cervix and sort of deliver it really quickly to the egg  thereby upping the odds of conception. It was called the  upsuck  theory. If you go all the way back to Hippocrates  physicians believed that orgasm in women was not just helpful for conception  but necessary. Doctors back then were routinely telling men the importance of pleasuring their wives. Marriage manual author and semen sniffer Theodoor van De Velde    has a line in his book. I loved this guy. I got a lot of mileage out of Theodoor van De Velde. He had this line in his book that supposedly comes from the Habsburg Monarchy  where there was an empress Maria Theresa  who was having trouble conceiving. And apparently the royal court physician said to her   I am of the opinion that the vulva of your most sacred majesty be titillated for some time prior to intercourse.  It's apparently  I don't know  on the record somewhere. Masters and Johnson  now we're moving forward to the     s. Masters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics  which is also really fun to say. They didn't buy it. And they decided  being Masters and Johnson  that they would get to the bottom of it. They brought women into the lab    I think it was five women    and outfitted them with cervical caps containing artificial semen. And in the artificial semen was a radio opaque substance  such that it would show up on an X ray. This is the     s. Anyway  these women sat in front of an X ray device. And they masturbated. And Masters and Johnson looked to see if the semen was being sucked up. Did not find any evidence of upsuck. You may be wondering   How do you make artificial semen   I have an answer for you. I have two answers. You can use flour and water  or cornstarch and water. I actually found three separate recipes in the literature. My favorite being the one that says    you know  they have the ingredients listed  and then in a recipe it will say  for example   Yield  two dozen cupcakes.  This one said   Yield  one ejaculate.  There's another way that orgasm might boost fertility. This one involves men. Sperm that sit around in the body for a week or more start to develop abnormalities that make them less effective at head banging their way into the egg. British sexologist Roy Levin has speculated that this is perhaps why men evolved to be such enthusiastic and frequent masturbators. He said   If I keep tossing myself off I get fresh sperm being made.  Which I thought was an interesting idea  theory. So now you have an evolutionary excuse. Okay. All righty. There is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom    pigs  for instance. In Denmark  the Danish National Committee for Pig Production found out that if you sexually stimulate a sow while you artificially inseminate her  you will see a six percent increase in the farrowing rate  which is the number of piglets produced. So they came up with this five point stimulation plan for the sows. There is posters they put in the barn  and they have a DVD. And I got a copy of this DVD. This is my unveiling  because I am going to show you a clip. So  okay. Now  here we go  la la la  off to work. It all looks very innocent. He's going to be doing things with his hands that the boar would use his snout  lacking hands. Okay. This is it. The boar has a very odd courtship repertoire. This is to mimic the weight of the boar. You should know  the clitoris of the pig is inside the vagina. So this may be sort of titillating for her. Here we go. And the happy result. I love this video. There is a point in this video  towards the beginning  where they zoom in for a close up of his hand with his wedding ring  as if to say   It's okay  it's just his job. He really does like women.  Okay. When I was in Denmark  my host was named Anne Marie. And I said   So why don't you just stimulate the clitoris of the pig  Why don't you have the farmers do that  That's not one of your five steps.  I have to read you what she said  because I love it. She said   It was a big hurdle just to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva. So we thought  let's not mention the clitoris right now.  Shy but ambitious pig farmers  however  can purchase a    this is true    a sow vibrator  that hangs on the sperm feeder tube to vibrate. Because  as I mentioned  the clitoris is inside the vagina. So possibly  you know  a little more arousing than it looks. And I also said to her   Now  these sows. I mean  you may have noticed there. The sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy.  And she said  you can't make that conclusion  because animals don't register pain or pleasure on their faces in the same way that we do. Pigs  for example  are more like dogs. They use the upper half of the face  the ears are very expressive. So you're not really sure what's going on with the pig. Primates  on the other hand  we use our mouths more. This is the ejaculation face of the stump tailed macaque. And  interestingly  this has been observed in female macaques  but only when mounting another female. Masters and Johnson. In the     s  they decided  okay  we're going to figure out the entire human sexual response cycle  from arousal  all the way through orgasm  in men and women    everything that happens in the human body. Okay  with women  a lot of this is happening inside. This did not stop Masters and Johnson. They developed an artificial coition machine. This is basically a penis camera on a motor. There is a phallus  clear acrylic phallus  with a camera and a light source  attached to a motor that is kind of going like this. And the woman would have sex with it. That is what they would do. Pretty amazing. Sadly  this device has been dismantled. This just kills me  not because I wanted to use it    I wanted to see it. One fine day  Alfred Kinsey decided to calculate the average distance traveled by ejaculated semen. This was not idle curiosity. Doctor Kinsey had heard    and there was a theory going around at the time  this being the     s    that the force with which semen is thrown against the cervix was a factor in fertility. Kinsey thought it was bunk  so he got to work. He got together in his lab     men  a measuring tape  and a movie camera. And in fact  he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out. It wasn't spurted or thrown or ejected under great force. However  the record holder landed just shy of the eight foot mark  which is impressive. Yes. Exactly. Sadly  he's anonymous. His name is not mentioned. In his write up of this experiment in his book  Kinsey wrote   Two sheets were laid down to protect the oriental carpets.  Which is my second favorite line in the entire oeuvre of Alfred Kinsey. My favorite being   Cheese crumbs spread before a pair of copulating rats will distract the female  but not the male.  Thank you very much. Thanks  Two years ago here at TED I reported that we had discovered at Saturn  with the Cassini Spacecraft  an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon Enceladus  seen here. This region seen here for the first time in the Cassini image taken in     . This is the south polar region  with the famous tiger stripe fractures crossing the south pole. And seen just recently in late       here is that region again  now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere is experiencing the onset of August and eventually winter. And I also reported that we'd made this mind blowing discovery    this once in a lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole  consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane. And at that time two years ago I mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers  and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface  but we weren't really sure. However  the implications of those results    of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry  and perhaps life itself    were so exciting that  in the intervening two years  we have focused more on Enceladus. We've flown the Cassini Spacecraft by this moon now several times  flying closer and deeper into these jets  into the denser regions of these jets  so that now we have come away with some very precise compositional measurements. And we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported. While they're not amino acids  we're now finding things like propane and benzene  hydrogen cyanide  and formaldehyde. And the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water  which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from pockets of liquid water  but that that liquid water is in contact with rock. And that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life. So we are very encouraged by these results. And we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon  under the south pole  an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms. Whether or not there are living organisms there  of course  is an entirely different matter. And that will have to await the arrival  back at Enceladus  of the spacecrafts  hopefully some time in the near future  specifically equipped to address that particular question. But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the Saturnine system  and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park  just because we can. Thank you. I'm here because I have a very important message  I think we have found the most important factor for success. And it was found close to here  Stanford. Psychology professor took kids that were four years old and put them in a room all by themselves. And he would tell the child  a four year old kid   Johnny  I am going to leave you here with a marshmallow for    minutes. If  after I come back  this marshmallow is here  you will get another one. So you will have two.  To tell a four year old kid to wait    minutes for something that they like  is equivalent to telling us   We'll bring you coffee in two hours.  Exact equivalent. So what happened when the professor left the room  As soon as the door closed... two out of three ate the marshmallow. Five seconds     seconds     seconds     seconds  two minutes  four minutes  eight minutes. Some lasted    and a half minutes. Couldn't do it. Could not wait. What's interesting is that one out of three would look at the marshmallow and go like this ... Would look at it. Put it back. They would walk around. They would play with their skirts and pants. That child already  at four  understood the most important principle for success  which is the ability to delay gratification. Self discipline  the most important factor for success.    years later     or    years later  follow up study. What did they find  They went to look for these kids who were now    and   . And they found that     percent of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful. They had good grades. They were doing wonderful. They were happy. They had their plans. They had good relationships with the teachers  students. They were doing fine. A great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow  they were in trouble. They did not make it to university. They had bad grades. Some of them dropped out. A few were still there with bad grades. A few had good grades. I had a question in my mind  Would Hispanic kids react the same way as the American kids  So I went to Colombia. And I reproduced the experiment. And it was very funny. I used four  five and six years old kids. And let me show you what happened. So what happened in Colombia  Hispanic kids  two out of three ate the marshmallow  one out of three did not. This little girl was interesting  she ate the inside of the marshmallow. In other words  she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it  so she would get two. But she ate it. So we know she'll be successful. But we have to watch her. She should not go into banking  for example  or work at a cash register. But she will be successful. And this applies for everything. Even in sales. The sales person that    the customer says   I want that.  And the person says   Okay  here you are.  That person ate the marshmallow. If the sales person says   Wait a second. Let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice.  Then you sell a lot more. So this has applications in all walks of life. I end with    the Koreans did this. You know what  This is so good that we want a marshmallow book for children. We did one for children. And now it is all over Korea. They are teaching these kids exactly this principle. And we need to learn that principle here in the States  because we have a big debt. We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing. Thank you so much. Let's talk about manias. Let's start with Beatlemania. Hysterical teenagers  crying  screaming  pandemonium. Sports mania  deafening crowds  all for one idea    get the ball in the net. Okay  religious mania  there's rapture  there's weeping  there's visions. Manias can be good. Manias can be alarming. Or manias can be deadly. The world has a new mania. A mania for learning English. Listen as Chinese students practice their English  by screaming it  Teacher  ... change my life  Students  I want to change my life  T  I don't want to let my parents down  S  I don't want to let my parents down  T  I don't ever want to let my country down  S  I don't ever want to let my country down  T  Most importantly... S  Most importantly... T  I don't want to let myself down  S  I don't want to let myself down  How many people are trying to learn English worldwide  Two billion of them. Students  A t shirt. A dress. Jay Walker  In Latin America  in India  in Southeast Asia  and most of all  in China. If you're a Chinese student  you start learning English in the third grade  by law. That's why this year  China will become the world's largest English speaking country. Why English  In a single word  opportunity. Opportunity for a better life  a job  to be able to pay for school  or put better food on the table. Imagine a student taking a giant test for three full days. Her score on this one test literally determines her future. She studies    hours a day for three years to prepare. Twenty five percent of her grade is based on English. It's called the gaokao  and    million high school Chinese students have already taken this grueling test. The intensity to learn English is almost unimaginable  unless you witness it. Teacher  Perfect  Students  Perfect  T  Perfect  S  Perfect  T  I want to speak perfect English  S  I want to speak perfect English  T  I want to speak ... S  I want to speak ... T  ... perfect English  S  ... perfect English  T  yelling more loudly   I want to change my life  S  yelling more loudly   I want to change my life  JW  So is English mania good or bad  Is English a tsunami  washing away other languages  Not likely. English is the world's second language. Your native language is your life. But with English you can become part of a wider conversation    a global conversation about global problems  like climate change or poverty  or hunger or disease. The world has other universal languages. Mathematics is the language of science. Music is the language of emotions. And now English is becoming the language of problem solving. Not because America is pushing it  but because the world is pulling it. So English mania is a turning point. Like the harnessing of electricity in our cities  or the fall of the Berlin Wall  English represents hope for a better future    a future where the world has a common language to solve its common problems. Thank you very much. This is my first trip  my first foreign trip as a first lady. Can you believe that  And while this is not my first visit to the U.K.  I have to say that I am glad that this is my first official visit. The special relationship between the United States and the U.K. is based not only on the relationship between governments  but the common language and the values that we share  and I'm reminded of that by watching you all today. During my visit I've been especially honored to meet some of Britain's most extraordinary women    women who are paving the way for all of you. And I'm honored to meet you  the future leaders of Great Britain and this world. And although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant  with me standing here as the First Lady of the United States of America  and you  just getting through school  I want you to know that we have very much in common. For nothing in my life's path would have predicted that I'd be standing here as the first African American First Lady of the United States of America. There is nothing in my story that would land me here. I wasn't raised with wealth or resources or any social standing to speak of. I was raised on the South Side of Chicago. That's the real part of Chicago. And I was the product of a working class community. My father was a city worker all of his life  and my mother was a stay at home mom. And she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother. Neither of them attended university. My dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the prime of his life. But even as it got harder for him to walk and get dressed in the morning    I saw him struggle more and more    my father never complained about his struggle. He was grateful for what he had. He just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder. And my brother and I were raised with all that you really need  love  strong values and a belief that with a good education and a whole lot of hard work  that there was nothing that we could not do. I am an example of what's possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nurtured by the people around them. I was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life  grandmothers  teachers  aunts  cousins  neighbors  who taught me about quiet strength and dignity. And my mother  the most important role model in my life  who lives with us at the White House and helps to care for our two little daughters  Malia and Sasha. She's an active presence in their lives  as well as mine  and is instilling in them the same values that she taught me and my brother  things like compassion  and integrity  and confidence  and perseverance    all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love that only a grandmother can give. I was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged by some strong male role models as well  including my father  my brother  uncles and grandfathers. The men in my life taught me some important things  as well. They taught me about what a respectful relationship should look like between men and women. They taught me about what a strong marriage feels like  that it's built on faith and commitment and an admiration for each other's unique gifts. They taught me about what it means to be a father and to raise a family. And not only to invest in your own home but to reach out and help raise kids in the broader community. And these were the same qualities that I looked for in my own husband  Barack Obama. And when we first met  one of the things that I remember is that he took me out on a date. And his date was to go with him to a community meeting. I know  how romantic. But when we met  Barack was a community organizer. He worked  helping people to find jobs and to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods. As he talked to the residents in that community center  he talked about two concepts. He talked about  the world as it is  and  the world as it should be.  And I talked about this throughout the entire campaign. What he said  that all too often  is that we accept the distance between those two ideas. And sometimes we settle for the world as it is  even when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations. But Barack reminded us on that day  all of us in that room  that we all know what our world should look like. We know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like. We all know. And he urged the people in that meeting  in that community  to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas  to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should be  one and the same. And I think about that today because I am reminded and convinced that all of you in this school are very important parts of closing that gap. You are the women who will build the world as it should be. You're going to write the next chapter in history. Not just for yourselves  but for your generation and generations to come. And that's why getting a good education is so important. That's why all of this that you're going through    the ups and the downs  the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't    why it's so important. Because communities and countries and ultimately the world are only as strong as the health of their women. And that's important to keep in mind. Part of that health includes an outstanding education. The difference between a struggling family and a healthy one is often the presence of an empowered woman or women at the center of that family. The difference between a broken community and a thriving one is often the healthy respect between men and women who appreciate the contributions each other makes to society. The difference between a languishing nation and one that will flourish is the recognition that we need equal access to education for both boys and girls. And this school  named after the U.K.'s first female doctor  and the surrounding buildings named for Mexican artist Frida Kahlo  Mary Seacole  the Jamaican nurse known as the  black Florence Nightingale   and the English author  Emily Bronte  honor women who fought sexism  racism and ignorance  to pursue their passions to feed their own souls. They allowed for no obstacles. As the sign said back there   without limitations.  They knew no other way to live than to follow their dreams. And having done so  these women moved many obstacles. And they opened many new doors for millions of female doctors and nurses and artists and authors  all of whom have followed them. And by getting a good education  you too can control your own destiny. Please remember that. If you want to know the reason why I'm standing here  it's because of education. I never cut class. Sorry  I don't know if anybody is cutting class. I never did it. I loved getting As. I liked being smart. I liked being on time. I liked getting my work done. I thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world. And you too  with these same values  can control your own destiny. You too can pave the way. You too can realize your dreams  and then your job is to reach back and to help someone just like you do the same thing. History proves that it doesn't matter whether you come from a council estate or a country estate. Your success will be determined by your own fortitude  your own confidence  your own individual hard work. That is true. That is the reality of the world that we live in. You now have control over your own destiny. And it won't be easy    that's for sure. But you have everything you need. Everything you need to succeed  you already have  right here. My husband works in this big office. They call it the Oval Office. In the White House  there's the desk that he sits at    it's called the Resolute desk. It was built by the timber of Her Majesty's Ship Resolute and given by Queen Victoria. It's an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations. And its name  Resolute  is a reminder of the strength of character that's required not only to lead a country  but to live a life of purpose  as well. And I hope in pursuing your dreams  you all remain resolute  that you go forward without limits  and that you use your talents    because there are many  we've seen them  it's there    that you use them to create the world as it should be. Because we are counting on you. We are counting on every single one of you to be the very best that you can be. Because the world is big. And it's full of challenges. And we need strong  smart  confident young women to stand up and take the reins. We know you can do it. We love you. Thank you so much. All human life  all life  depends on plants. Let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds. Just think for a moment. It doesn't matter whether you live in a small African village  or you live in a big city  everything comes back to plants in the end  whether it's for the food  the medicine  the fuel  the construction  the clothing  all the obvious things  or whether it's for the spiritual and recreational things that matter to us so much  or whether it's soil formation  or the effect on the atmosphere  or primary production. Damn it  even the books here are made out of plants. All these things  they come back to plants. And without them we wouldn't be here. Now plants are under threat. They're under threat because of changing climate. And they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet with people like us. And people like us want to do things that destroy plants  and their habitats. And whether that's because of food production  or because of the introduction of alien plants into places that they really oughtn't be  or because of habitats being used for other purposes    all these things are meaning that plants have to adapt  or die  or move. And plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move because there might be cities and other things in the way. So if all human life depends on plants  doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them  I think it does. And I want to tell you about a project to save plants. And the way that you save plants is by storing seeds. Because seeds  in all their diverse glory  are plants' futures. All the genetic information for future generations of plants are held in seeds. So here is the building  it looks rather unassuming  really. But it goes down below ground many stories. And it's the largest seed bank in the world. It exists not only in southern England  but distributed around the world. I'll come to that. This is a nuclear proof facility. God forbid that it should have to withstand that. So if you're going to build a seed bank  you have to decide what you're going to store in it. Right  And we decided that what we want to store first of all  are the species that are most under threat. And those are the dry land species. So first of all we did deals with    different countries. It means negotiating with heads of state  and with secretaries of state in    countries to sign treaties. We have     partner institutions all over the world  in all those countries colored orange. People come from all over the world to learn  and then they go away and plan exactly how they're going to collect these seeds. They have thousands of people all over the world tagging places where those plants are said to exist. They search for them. They find them in flower. And they go back when their seeds have arrived. And they collect the seeds. All over the world. The seeds    some of if is very untechnical. You kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off. You label them. You do some high tech things here and there  some low tech things here and there. And the main thing is that you have to dry them very carefully  at low temperature. And then you have to store them at about minus    degrees C    that's about minus four Fahrenheit  I think    with a very critically low moisture content. And these seeds will be able to germinate  we believe  with many of the species  in thousands of years  and certainly in hundreds of years. It's no good storing the seeds if you don't know they're still viable. So every    years we do germination tests on every sample of seeds that we have. And this is a distributed network. So all around the world people are doing the same thing. And that enables us to develop germination protocols. That means that we know the right combination of heat and cold and the cycles that you have to get to make the seed germinate. And that is very useful information. And then we grow these things  and we tell people  back in the countries where these seeds have come from   Look  actually we're not just storing this to get the seeds later  but we can give you this information about how to germinate these difficult plants.  And that's already happening. So where have we got to  I am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed    that's three thousand millionth seed    is now stored. Ten percent of all plant species on the planet         species are safe         species  if we get the funding  by next year. Twenty five percent of all the world's plants  by     . These are not just crop plants  as you might have seen stored in Svalbard in Norway    fantastic work there. This is at least     times bigger. We have thousands of collections that have been sent out all over the world  drought tolerant forest species sent to Pakistan and Egypt  especially photosynthetic efficient plants come here to the United States  salt tolerant pasture species sent to Australia  the list goes on and on. These seeds are used for restoration. So in habitats that have already been damaged  like the tall grass prairie here in the USA  or in mined land in various countries  restoration is already happening because of these species    and because of this collection. Some of these plants  like the ones on the bottom to the left of your screen  they are down to the last few remaining members. The one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck  that is down to about    last remaining trees. Fantastically useful plant  both for protein and for medicine. We have training going on in China  in the USA  and many other countries. How much does it cost        dollars per species is the average. I think that's cheap  at the price. And that gets you all the scientific data that goes with it. The future research is  How can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds  without having to plant them every    years   And we're almost there. Thank you very much. College presidents are not the first people who come to mind when the subject is the uses of the creative imagination. So I thought I'd start by telling you how I got here. The story begins in the late '  s. I was invited to meet with leading educators from the newly free Eastern Europe and Russia. They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities. Since education under the Soviet Union was essentially propaganda serving the purposes of a state ideology  they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women. Given this rare opportunity to start fresh  they chose liberal arts as the most compelling model because of its historic commitment to furthering its students' broadest intellectual  and deepest ethical potential. Having made that decision they came to the United States  home of liberal arts education  to talk with some of us most closely identified with that kind of education. They spoke with a passion  an urgency  an intellectual conviction that  for me  was a voice I had not heard in decades  a dream long forgotten. For  in truth  we had moved light years from the passions that animated them. But for me  unlike them  in my world  the slate was not clean  and what was written on it was not encouraging. In truth  liberal arts education no longer exists    at least genuine liberal arts education    in this country. We have professionalized liberal arts to the point where they no longer provide the breadth of application and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement that is their signature. Over the past century the expert has dethroned the educated generalist to become the sole model of intellectual accomplishment.  Applause  Expertise has for sure had its moments. But the price of its dominance is enormous. Subject matters are broken up into smaller and smaller pieces  with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure. We have even managed to make the study of literature arcane. You may think you know what is going on in that Jane Austen novel    that is  until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism. The progression of today's college student is to jettison every interest except one. And within that one  to continually narrow the focus  learning more and more about less and less  this  despite the evidence all around us of the interconnectedness of things. Lest you think I exaggerate  here are the beginnings of the A B Cs of anthropology. As one moves up the ladder  values other than technical competence are viewed with increasing suspicion. Questions such as   What kind of a world are we making  What kind of a world should we be making  What kind of a world can we be making   are treated with more and more skepticism  and move off the table. In so doing  the guardians of secular democracy in effect yield the connection between education and values to fundamentalists  who  you can be sure  have no compunctions about using education to further their values  the absolutes of a theocracy. Meanwhile  the values and voices of democracy are silent. Either we have lost touch with those values or  no better  believe they need not or cannot be taught. This aversion to social values may seem at odds with the explosion of community service programs. But despite the attention paid to these efforts  they remain emphatically extracurricular. In effect  civic mindedness is treated as outside the realm of what purports to be serious thinking and adult purposes. Simply put  when the impulse is to change the world  the academy is more likely to engender a learned helplessness than to create a sense of empowerment. This brew    oversimplification of civic engagement  idealization of the expert  fragmentation of knowledge  emphasis on technical mastery  neutrality as a condition of academic integrity    is toxic when it comes to pursuing the vital connections between education and the public good  between intellectual integrity and human freedom  which were at the heart    my European colleagues. When the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge were more than enough  I can assure you  to give one pause  what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable. Whether it was threats to the environment  inequities in the distribution of wealth  lack of a sane policy or a sustainable policy with respect to the continuing uses of energy  we were in desperate straits. And that was only the beginning. The corrupting of our political life had become a living nightmare  nothing was exempt    separation of powers  civil liberties  the rule of law  the relationship of church and state. Accompanied by a squandering of the nation's material wealth that defied credulity. A harrowing predilection for the uses of force had become commonplace  with an equal distaste for the alternative forms of influence. At the same time  all of our firepower was impotent when it came to halting or even stemming the slaughter in Rwanda  Darfur  Myanmar. Our public education  once a model for the world  has become most noteworthy for its failures. Mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy eludes vast numbers of our students. Despite having a research establishment that is the envy of the world  more than half of the American public don't believe in evolution. And don't press your luck about how much those who do believe in it actually understand it. Incredibly  this nation  with all its material  intellectual and spiritual resources  seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas. Equally startling  from my point of view  is the fact that no one was drawing any connections between what is happening to the body politic  and what is happening in our leading educational institutions. We may be at the top of the list when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth. We are not even on the list when it comes to our responsibility for the health of this democracy. We are playing with fire. You can be sure Jefferson knew what he was talking about when he said   If a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization  it expects what never was  and never will be.  On a more personal note  this betrayal of our principles  our decency  our hope  made it impossible for me to avoid the question   What will I say  years from now  when people ask  'Where were you '  As president of a leading liberal arts college  famous for its innovative history  there were no excuses. So the conversation began at Bennington. Knowing that if we were to regain the integrity of liberal education  it would take radical rethinking of basic assumptions  beginning with our priorities. Enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective. The accomplishment of civic virtue is tied to the uses of intellect and imagination at their most challenging. Our ways of approaching agency and authority turn inside out to reflect the reality that no one has the answers to the challenges facing citizens in this century  and everyone has the responsibility for trying and participating in finding them. Bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences in personal and professional objectives. But the balances redressed  our shared purposes assume an equal if not greater importance. When the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward. The idea is to make the political social challenges themselves    from health and education to the uses of force    the organizers of the curriculum. They would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines. But structures designed to connect  rather than divide mutually dependent circles  rather than isolating triangles. And the point is not to treat these topics as topics of study  but as frameworks of action. The challenge  to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant and sustainable difference. Contrary to widely held assumptions  an emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking. The importance of coming to grips with values like justice  equity  truth  becomes increasingly evident as students discover that interest alone cannot tell them what they need to know when the issue is rethinking education  our approach to health  or strategies for achieving an economics of equity. The value of the past also comes alive  it provides a lot of company. You are not the first to try to figure this out  just as you are unlikely to be the last. Even more valuable  history provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual  as well as the intended consequences of ideas. In the language of my students   Deep thought matters when you're contemplating what to do about things that matter.  A new liberal arts that can support this action oriented curriculum has begun to emerge. Rhetoric  the art of organizing the world of words to maximum effect. Design  the art of organizing the world of things. Mediation and improvisation also assume a special place in this new pantheon. Quantitative reasoning attains its proper position at the heart of what it takes to manage change where measurement is crucial. As is a capacity to discriminate systematically between what is at the core and what is at the periphery. And when making connections is of the essence  the power of technology emerges with special intensity. But so does the importance of content. The more powerful our reach  the more important the question  About what   When improvisation  resourcefulness  imagination are key  artists  at long last  take their place at the table  when strategies of action are in the process of being designed. In this dramatically expanded ideal of a liberal arts education where the continuum of thought and action is its life's blood  knowledge honed outside the academy becomes essential. Social activists  business leaders  lawyers  politicians  professionals will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good. Students  in turn  continuously move outside the classroom to engage the world directly. And of course  this new wine needs new bottles if we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism of this idea. The most important discovery we made in our focus on public action was to appreciate that the hard choices are not between good and evil  but between competing goods. This discovery is transforming. It undercuts self righteousness  radically alters the tone and character of controversy  and enriches dramatically the possibilities for finding common ground. Ideology  zealotry  unsubstantiated opinions simply won't do. This is a political education  to be sure. But it is a politics of principle  not of partisanship. So the challenge for Bennington is to do it. On the cover of Bennington's      holiday card is the architect's sketch of a building opening in      that is to be a center for the advancement of public action. The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment. Think of it as a kind of secular church. The words on the card describe what will happen inside. We intend to turn the intellectual and imaginative power  passion and boldness of our students  faculty and staff to developing strategies for acting on the critical challenges of our time. So we are doing our job. While these past weeks have been a time of national exhilaration in this country  it would be tragic if you thought this meant your job was done. The glacial silence we have experienced in the face of the shredding of the constitution  the unraveling of our public institutions  the deterioration of our infrastructure is not limited to the universities. We the people have become inured to our own irrelevance when it comes to doing anything significant about anything that matters concerning governance  beyond waiting another four years. We persist also in being sidelined by the idea of the expert as the only one capable of coming up with answers  despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The problem is there is no such thing as a viable democracy made up of experts  zealots  politicians and spectators. People will continue and should continue to learn everything there is to know about something or other. We actually do it all the time. And there will be and should be those who spend a lifetime pursuing a very highly defined area of inquiry. But this single mindedness will not yield the flexibilities of mind  the multiplicity of perspectives  the capacities for collaboration and innovation this country needs. That is where you come in. What is certain is that the individual talent exhibited in such abundance here  needs to turn its attention to that collaborative  messy  frustrating  contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy. President Obama and his team simply cannot do it alone. If the question of where to start seems overwhelming you are at the beginning  not the end of this adventure. Being overwhelmed is the first step if you are serious about trying to get at things that really matter  on a scale that makes a difference. So what do you do when you feel overwhelmed  Well  you have two things. You have a mind. And you have other people. Start with those  and change the world. Information technology grows in an exponential manner. It's not linear. And our intuition is linear. When we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago we made linear predictions where that animal would be  and that worked fine. It's hardwired in our brains. But the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies. And it's not just computation. There is a big difference between linear and exponential growth. If I take    steps linearly    one  two  three  four  five    I get to   . If I take    steps exponentially    two  four  eight        I get to a billion. It makes a huge difference. And that really describes information technology. When I was a student at MIT  we all shared one computer that took up a whole building. The computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper  a million times smaller  a thousand times more powerful. That's a billion fold increase in capability per dollar that we've actually experienced since I was a student. And we're going to do it again in the next    years. Information technology progresses through a series of S curves where each one is a different paradigm. So people say   What's going to happen when Moore's Law comes to an end   Which will happen around     . We'll then go to the next paradigm. And Moore's Law was not the first paradigm to bring exponential growth to computing. The exponential growth of computing started decades before Gordon Moore was even born. And it doesn't just apply to computation. It's really any technology where we can measure the underlying information properties. Here we have    famous computers. I put them in a logarithmic graph. The logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase  because this represents trillions fold increase since the      census. In     s they were shrinking vacuum tubes  making them smaller and smaller. They finally hit a wall  they couldn't shrink the vacuum tube any more and keep the vacuum. And that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes  but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing. We went to the fourth paradigm  transistors  and finally integrated circuits. When that comes to an end we'll go to the sixth paradigm  three dimensional self organizing molecular circuits. But what's even more amazing  really  than this fantastic scale of progress  is that    look at how predictable this is. I mean this went through thick and thin  through war and peace  through boom times and recessions. The Great Depression made not a dent in this exponential progression. We'll see the same thing in the economic recession we're having now. At least the exponential growth of information technology capability will continue unabated. And I just updated these graphs. Because I had them through      in my book   The Singularity is Near.  So we updated them  so I could present it here  to     . And I was asked   Well aren't you nervous  Maybe it kind of didn't stay on this exponential progression.  I was a little nervous because maybe the data wouldn't be right  but I've done this now for    years  and it has stayed on this exponential progression. Look at this graph here.You could buy one transistor for a dollar in     . You can buy half a billion today  and they are actually better  because they are faster. But look at how predictable this is. And I'd say this knowledge is over fitting to past data. I've been making these forward looking predictions for about    years. And the cost of a transistor cycle  which is a measure of the price performance of electronics  comes down about every year. That's a    percent deflation rate. And it's also true of other examples  like DNA data or brain data. But we more than make up for that. We actually ship more than twice as much of every form of information technology. We've had    percent growth in constant dollars in every form of information technology for the last half century  despite the fact that you can get twice as much of it each year. This is a completely different example. This is not Moore's Law. The amount of DNA data we've sequenced has doubled every year. The cost has come down by half every year. And this has been a smooth progression since the beginning of the genome project. And halfway through the project  skeptics said   Well  this is not working out. You're halfway through the genome project and you've finished one percent of the project.  But that was really right on schedule. Because if you double one percent seven more times  which is exactly what happened  you get     percent. And the project was finished on time. Communication technologies     different ways to measure this  the number of bits being moved around  the size of the Internet. But this has progressed at an exponential pace. This is deeply democratizing. I wrote  over    years ago in  The Age of Intelligent Machines   when the Soviet Union was going strong  that it would be swept away by this growth of decentralized communication. And we will have plenty of computation as we go through the   st century to do things like simulate regions of the human brain. But where will we get the software  Some critics say   Oh  well software is stuck in the mud.  But we are learning more and more about the human brain. Spatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year. The amount of data we're getting about the brain is doubling every year. And we're showing that we can actually turn this data into working models and simulations of brain regions. There is about    regions of the brain that have been modeled  simulated and tested  the auditory cortex  regions of the visual cortex  cerebellum  where we do our skill formation  slices of the cerebral cortex  where we do our rational thinking. And all of this has fueled an increase  very smooth and predictable  of productivity. We've gone from    dollars to     dollars in constant dollars in the value of an average hour of human labor  fueled by this information technology. And we're all concerned about energy and the environment. Well this is a logarithmic graph. This represents a smooth doubling  every two years  of the amount of solar energy we're creating  particularly as we're now applying nanotechnology  a form of information technology  to solar panels. And we're only eight doublings away from it meeting     percent of our energy needs. And there is    thousand times more sunlight than we need. We ultimately will merge with this technology. It's already very close to us. When I was a student it was across campus  now it's in our pockets. What used to take up a building now fits in our pockets. What now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood cell in    years. And we will begin to actually deeply influence our health and our intelligence  as we get closer and closer to this technology. Based on that we are announcing  here at TED  in true TED tradition  Singularity University. It's a new university that's founded by Peter Diamandis  who is here in the audience  and myself. It's backed by NASA and Google  and other leaders in the high tech and science community. And our goal was to assemble the leaders  both teachers and students  in these exponentially growing information technologies  and their application. But Larry Page made an impassioned speech at our organizing meeting  saying we should devote this study to actually addressing some of the major challenges facing humanity. And if we did that  then Google would back this. And so that's what we've done. The last third of the nine week intensive summer session will be devoted to a group project to address some major challenge of humanity. Like for example  applying the Internet  which is now ubiquitous  in the rural areas of China or in Africa  to bringing health information to developing areas of the world. And these projects will continue past these sessions  using collaborative interactive communication. All the intellectual property that is created and taught will be online and available  and developed online in a collaborative fashion. Here is our founding meeting. But this is being announced today. It will be permanently headquartered in Silicon Valley  at the NASA Ames research center. There are different programs for graduate students  for executives at different companies. The first six tracks here    artificial intelligence  advanced computing technologies  biotechnology  nanotechnology    are the different core areas of information technology. Then we are going to apply them to the other areas  like energy  ecology  policy law and ethics  entrepreneurship  so that people can bring these new technologies to the world. So we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten from both the intellectual leaders  the high tech leaders  particularly Google and NASA. This is an exciting new venture. And we invite you to participate. Thank you very much. I have a big impact on the planet to travel here by plane. I emitted  in the atmosphere  nine tons of CO   that is the weight of two elephants. I came here to speak about ecology  and I emitted as much CO  as a Frenchman in one year. So what do I have to do  I have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home  I have to do my carbon offset in another way  like I do every time. In fact my work is to show our impact on our planet. I'm going to show you some examples of the last pictures I've done in the last year. Alberta sand oil  a lot of pollution. You know the problem  we don't want to believe what we know. In Alberta people work nonstop     hours by seven to extract as much oil as they can. We know about the end of oil. Oil sand is not a long term solution. But we use three times more oil than we find every year. We don't want to believe what we know. Deny. Coral reef in New Caledonia.     percent of the coral may be wiped out before      because of global warming. And you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature  and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea. North Pole. I've done this picture last summer. It was impossible to do this picture    years ago. Now there is a new way open between Atlantic and Pacific. The thickness of the Arctic decreased more than    percent since     . There is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice. Sad picture. It lost    percent of its ice. According to scientists  in     years all the mountain glacier will be gone. Glaciers are very important for the life on earth. Like Al Gore told you  two billion people live on the water from the glacier of Himalaya. Return of fish men. One fifth of human kind depend on fish to live. Today now    percent of the fish stock are over exploited. According to FAO  if we don't change our system of fishing the main sea resources will be gone in     . We don't want to believe what we know. The beautiful picture  by  unclear  in Africa. One human of six have not enough to eat in the world. One billion people have not enough to eat. In Africa  corn is one of the main foods in many places. Here in America     percent of the corn cultivated is used to feed animals or to do oil. Palm tree plantation in Borneo. Every year we lose    thousand square miles in deforestation. Refugee camp in Darfur. Today we have    million refugees in the world. According to the U.N.  we speak about     million refugees in     . I always show my pictures in the street. We have done already     exhibitions in the cities. But how to understand the world without the voice of people  Landscape was not enough. It was obvious to me to do another work. I launched a project named Six Billion Others. I sent around the world six cameramen asking the same question  the same crucial question  about life. We have done five thousand interviews. I'm going to show you this. Man  The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life  It's when my dad told me   Here  I give you this girl as your fiance.  Woman  Love  Love is nice if you can have it. Second Man  Romeo and Juliet  Sassi and Panno  Dodi and Diana  Heer and Ranjha  this is love  Third Man  My greatest fear is ... Woman  You're asking me a hard question. Fourth Man  I live happily because what else should I do  Fifth Man  The first thing I remember ...  Sixth Man  That's how I learned  by my mother   Fifth Man  ... from my childhood   Sixth Man  that you should respect humans.  Fifth Man  we were having fun  biking.  Sixth Man  I will never forget those words.  Seventh Man  We invented stories  we flew around the world  while remaining in our attic. Eighth Man  I had a big laugh today. Ninth Man  You see  family is ... it's awful.   th Man  In the word life  you have the life.   th Man  Who am I  Isn't that the biggest question    th Man  If I was to go back to Iraq and speak to the people  I'd have to bow down and kiss their feet. Just as that woman tried to kiss my feet when we were taking her sons. I feel ashamed. And I feel humbled by their strength. And I will forever feel a need to make reparations to Iraq. Second Woman  Dad  Mom  I grew up. You shouldn't worry about me. Dad doesn't need to go to work. My family ... What can I say  At the moment  my family is very poor  my life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more and to let my parents stay and have something to live on. I don't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty. If someday I can achieve something  I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy. Thank you. Thank you for having fed me and raised me  and for making my life of today. Thank you.   th Man  After seven years now of being in a wheelchair  I've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair. I still surf. I sail the world. I freedive. After many people said I couldn't do that. And I think that comes from connecting with nature  connecting with the energy of life  because we're all disabled in some way on the planet    spiritually  mentally or physically. I got the easy part.   th Man  Let's say that you and me like each other. You come from elsewhere. You don't know me. I don't know you. We talk without lying. If I do like you  I give you one cow and many other things and we become friends. How can we make it all by ourselves  YAB  You can also go to the website  answer    respond to the questions also. Forty crucial questions. Now I am going to speak to you about my movie. For the last three years  I was shooting the earth for the movie. The name of the movie is  Home      Maison.  It is about the state of the planet. It's a fantastic story of life on the earth. I'm very proud to show you the teaser. Video  This Earth is four and a half billion years old. These plants  several hundred million years old. And we humans have been walking upright for only     thousand years. We've managed to adapt  and have conquered the whole planet. For generations  we've been raising our children  not unlike millions of other species living beside us. For the past    years I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers from high up in the sky. Our life is tied to the well being of our planet. We depend on water  forests  deserts  oceans. Fishing  breeding  farming are still the world's foremost human occupations. And what binds us together is far greater than what divides us. We all share the same need for the earth's gifts    the same wish to rise above ourselves  and become better. And yet we carry on raising walls to keep us apart. Today our greatest battle is to protect the natural offerings of our planet. In less than    years we've altered it more thoroughly than in the entire history of mankind. Half of the world's forests have vanished. Water resources are running low. Intensive farming is depleting soils. Our energy sources are not sustainable. The climate is changing. We are endangering ourselves. We're only trying to improve our lives. But the wealth gaps are growing wider. We haven't yet understood that we're going at a much faster pace than the planet can sustain. We know that solutions are available today. We all have the power to change this trend for the better. So what are we waiting for  YAB  Luc Besson is the producer of the movie. But it is not a normal movie. The film is going to be distributed free. This film has no copyright. On the five of June  the environment day  everybody can download the movie on Internet. The film is given for free to the distributor for TV and theater to show it the fifth of June. There is no business on this movie. It is also available for school  cities  NGOs and you. We have to believe what we know. Let me tell you something. It's too late to be pessimistic    really too late. We have all a part of the solutions. To finish  I would like to welcome the      th baby born since the beginning of this talk. Merci beaucoup. I love you.  The Better Man.  I was the better at getting and keeping. You were the better at spend and spend  I was the better at grubbing and heaping  But who was the better man in the end  Yes  who was the better man  my friend  You were the better with lords and ladies  I was the better at pillaging Troy  You were the better at kissing the babies  I was the better at search and destroy. But who was the better man  old boy  Who was the better man  I was the better at improvisation  You were the better at spinning the plates  I was the better at procrastination  You were the better at quiet debate. But who was the better man  old mate  Who was the better man  You were the better at rolling a reefer  I was the better at coke and rum  Remember that night on the beach in Ibiza  The Maori twins with the tattooed bum  But who was the better man  old chum  Who was the better man  Now we come down to it  relatives grieving. Out in the hall with their crocodile tears  Now that you're out of it  now that you're leaving  Now that they've sealed your arse and your ears  What I've been meaning to tell you for years  And years  and years  and years  old friend ... Is that you were the better man  in the end  You were the better man  My friend. I wrote this next poem for my mother. Every one of us had a mother  only one    probably the most important person in your life  if you're lucky enough to know them. My mother was certainly the most important in mine. Let me try and describe her to you. She's    years old. She's frail. White  platinum hair. Why do they do that  Why do old ladies go to those hair shops  and make those helmets  Bright as a button. All the ducks in a row. Looks like a much prettier version of Margaret Thatcher  but without any of the soft bits in Margaret's character. I wrote this poem for her. These are not my beliefs. But my mother has lived by this creed all her life.  Never Go Back.  Never go back. Never go back. Never return to the haunts of your youth. Keep to the track  to the beaten track  Memory holds all you need of the truth. Never look back. Never look back. Never succumb to the gorgon's stare. Keep to the track  to the beaten track  No one is waiting and nothing is there. Never go back. Never go back. Never surrender the future you earned. Keep to the track  to the beaten track  Never return to the bridges you've burned. Never look back. Never look back. Never retreat to the 'glorious past.' Keep to the track  to the beaten track  Treat every day of your life as your last. Never go back. Never go back. Never acknowledge the ghost on the stair. Keep to the track  to the beaten track  No one is waiting and nothing is there. Now ladies and gentlemen  I'm up on me hobbyhorse. If every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon were tied end to end along a railroad track  that would be me  stoking the train without a qualm in the world. Ladies  don't do it. Don't do it. You think we want you to do it  but we don't want you to do it. Stop it. Tell them to go to hell. You bodies are wonderful as they are. Just leave them alone.  To a Beautiful Lady of a Certain Age.  Lady lady  do not weep. What is gone is gone. Now sleep. Turn your pillow. Dry your tears. Count thy sheep and not thy years. Nothing good can come of this. Time rules all  my dearest. 'Tis but folly to be waging war On one who never lost before. Lady  this is all in vain. Youth can never come again  We have drunk the summer wine. None can make a stitch in time. Nip and tuck till crack of doom. What is foretold in the womb May not be foresworn with gold. Nor may time be bought or sold. Dearest  do I love thee less  Do I shrink from thy caress  Think you I could cease to care  Never was there one so fair  Lady lady  do not weep    What is gone is gone. Now sleep. Lean against me  calm your fears  Count thy blessings  not thy years. America  ladies and gentlemen  has done more for me financially than Britain ever has  or ever could have done. I was born in Britain  as you have probably guessed. Even when on its worst behavior  I find myself automatically defending the USA from the sneers of green eyed Europhiles playing their Greek card to Roman trumps. America is an empire. I hope you know that now. All empires  by definition  are bumbling  shambolic  bullying  bureaucratic affairs  as certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy  as they are corrupted by power in their dotage. I am no historian  ladies and gentlemen. But it seems to be that the USA's sins  compared to those of many previous empires  are of a more moderate  if more pervasive  kind. Let me put this bluntly. If Americans are so fat  stupid and ignorant  my dear friends from Birmingham  how come they rule the world   Hail to the Gods of America.  Hail to the Gods of America  Hail to the gods of the dream. Invictus E Pluribus Unum. But which of them reigns supreme  Which is America's Jupiter  The Brahmins of Capital Hill  A sorcerer's profit on Wall Street  They eye of a dollar bill  Or is it celebrity status  The worship of those we hate. Or the cult of living forever  If only we'd watch our weight. What of the titans of media  Or Hollywood's siren call  What of the temples of justice  Whose servants enslave us all  What of the Brand and the Label  What of the upstart Sport  And what of the Constitution  That bully of last resort  Hail to the God of America  Whose power the masses extol    Convenience rules America  Convenience owns our soul. Aye  that it does. And if you would like to know why I am not a father    I  who by a miracle have    godchildren    the answer is in this poem  which upsets me every time I read it.  Love Came to Visit Me.  Love came to visit me  shy as a fawn. But finding me busy  she fled  with the dawn. At    the torch of resentment was lit. My rage at injustice waxed hot as the pits. The flux of its lava cleared all in its path. Comrades and enemies fled from its wrath. Yet lovers grew wary  once novelty waned To lie with a bloody man  his terror unfeigned. At    my powers seemed mighty to me. The fruits of my rivals  I shook from the tree. By guile and by bluster  by night and by day  I battered and scattered the fools from my way. And women grew willing to sham and to bluff. Their trinkets and baubles cost little enough. From    to     grown easy and sly  I wined them and dined them  like pigs in a sty. We feasted and reveled and rutted in muck  Forgetting our peril  forgetting to duck  Forgetting times arrows are sharper than knives. Grown sick to our stomachs  and sick of our lives. Love came to visit me  shy as a fawn. But finding me busy  she fled with the dawn. Um  there are    I've got far too much money and I have far too much fun in my businesses. So poetry came as a complete shock to me  ladies and gentlemen. A complete shock. I was a little ill. Okay  I was ill. Okay  I had a life threatening illness  you know. I was in a clinic. I wasn't allowed to make telephone calls. I wasn't allowed to see any of my    you know  whatever. So  in the end I begged a pack of Post it notes off a nurse. And from another nurse  I begged a pencil  pen. And I didn't know what else to do. So I started to write poetry. That was in October of     . I'm not an evil man. But sometimes I try to put myself in an evil man's position. I'm not a glorious and fantastic looking woman  who men fall down  you know  when she walks in a room. But sometimes I try to put myself in that position. Not with much success. But it's interesting to me. I love to write historical verse. I love to think what they thought  what it was like. Because although many of the speakers and many of the people who are in the audience  although you guys can not only go to the moon  you know  you're going to totally transform everything. Cloning will transform everything. Voice navigation will transform everything. I don't know. You can do anything you want. All you guys are so clever  and women  you can do it all  But human nature doesn't change  mate. My friends  human nature is exactly the same as it was when my ancestor    probably it was my ancestor    got his hands around the neck of the last Neanderthal  and battered the bastard to death. You think we didn't do that  Oh  we did. We killed every single one of them. Inch by inch we killed them. We hunted them down wherever they were. Rivals for meat. Rivals for berries. We're still doing it  with all of the genius assembled in this room. Our natures haven't changed a single iota. And they never will. Even when we've got off this little planet  and have put some of our eggs in some other baskets. And I am as bad as you. I spent eight years running one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world. And at seven o'clock every night  I took me some more girls  already corrupted. I never did anything to anyone that wasn't. And I took crack cocaine  every single night for seven years. It was like Dante's  Inferno.  It was unbelievable. One of the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erection for about four hours. And you stay up for   . It was absolutely unbelievable. Twenty two godchildren I've got. What do I say to them  I only stopped because I thought if I got caught  what would happen to my mother. If you're a woman  remember that. The love of your son can utterly transform anything he does.  Our Lady in White.  Pale she was  listless  And soft to the touch. A generous mistress Whom many loved much. Shoulder to shoulder  Night after night  We hoarded and sold her    Our Lady in White. We breathed but to savor her crystal caress. We craved but to favor the hem of her dress. We dabbled and babbled  Denying our thirsts. But always we scrabbled to lie with her first. Absent  we missed her  grew haggard and limp. Toyed with her sister  or threatened her pimp. Came word out of Babel  the lady returns  And there on the table we took her  in turns. Sensing the power that tyranny craves  There in that hour  she made us her slaves. Many there were  to covet her kiss. My shame as a spur  I fled the abyss. But only just. I used to be a Malthusian. This was my mental model of the world  exploding population  small planet  it's going to lead to ugly things. But I'm moving past Malthus  because I think that we just might be about     years from a kind of new enlightenment. Here's why. This is the U.N.'s population data  you may have seen  for the world. And the world's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than    billion  late this century. And after that  most likely it's going to begin to decline. So what then  Most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth. So a lot of economists look at declining population and expect to see stagnation  maybe depression. But a declining population is going to have at least two very beneficial economic effects. One  fewer people on a fixed amount of land make investing in property a bad bet. In the cities  a lot of the cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value. Take away land speculation  price of land drops. And that begins to lift a heavy burden off the world's poor. Number two  a declining population means scarce labor. Scarce labor drives wages. As wages increase that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class. Now I'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the Black Death. But look what happened in Europe after the plague  rising wages  land reform  technological innovation  birth of the middle class  and after that  forward looking social movements like the Renaissance  and later the Enlightenment. Most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward  romanticizing the past. All of the Western religions begin with the notion of Eden  and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future. So human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide from the good old days. But I think we're in for another change  about two generations after the top of that curve  once the effects of a declining population start to settle in. At that point  we'll start romanticizing the future again  instead of the nasty  brutish past. So why does this matter  Why talk about social economic movements that may be more than a century away  Because transitions are dangerous times. When land owners start to lose money  and labor demands more pay  there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future. Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions. If we have a positive view about the future then we may be able to accelerate through that turn  instead of careening off a cliff. If we can make it through the next     years  I think that your great great grandchildren will forget all about Malthus. And instead  they'll be planning for the future and starting to build the   nd Century Enlightenment. Thank you. What's happening to the climate  It is unbelievably bad. This is  obviously  that famous view now of the Arctic  which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years. Very  very  very scary. So we all look at what we can do. And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO      percent are tied to buildings. Only nine percent is passenger cars  interestingly enough. So we ran off to a sushi bar. And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea. And it was something called EcoRock. And we said we could redesign the     year old gypsum drywall process that generates    billion pounds of CO  a year. So it was a big idea. We wanted to reduce that by    percent  which is exactly what we've done. We started R D in     . Decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing. There is the inside of our lab. We haven't shown this before. But our people had to do some       different mixes to get this right  to hit our targets. And they worked absolutely very  very  very hard. So then we went forward and built our production line in China. We don't build this production equipment any longer in the U.S.  unfortunately. We did the line install over the summer. We started right there  with absolutely nothing. You're seeing for the first time  a brand new drywall production line  not made using gypsum at all. That's the finished production line there. We got our first panel out on December third. That is the slurry being poured onto paper  basically. That's the line running. The exciting thing is  look at the faces of the people. These are people who worked this project for two to three years. And they are so excited. That's the first board off the line. Our Vice President of Operation kissing the board. Obviously very  very excited. But this has a huge  huge impact on the environment. We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that  had a great signing ceremony  leading to people hopefully using these products across the world. And we've got Cradle to Cradle Gold on this thing. We happened to win  just recently  the Green Product of the Year for  The Re Invention of Drywall   from Popular Science. Thank you. Thank you. So here is what we learned        gallons of gas equivalent to build one house. You probably had no idea. It's like driving around the world six times. We must change everything. Look around the room  chairs  wood  everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem. Don't listen to the people who say you can't do this  because anyone can. And these job losses  we can fix them with green collar jobs. We've got four plants. We're building this stuff around the country. We're going as fast as we can. Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum  you know  CO  generated. Right  So what will you do  I'll tell you what I did and why I did it. And I know my time's up. Those are my kids  Natalie and David. When they have their kids        they'd better look back at Grandpa and say   Hey  you gave it a good shot. You did the best you could with the team that you had.  So my hope is that when you leave TED  you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it. And if you don't know how  please find me    I will help you. Last but not least  Bill Gates  I know you invented Windows. Wait till you see  maybe next year  what kind of windows we've invented. Thank you so much. This is a world changing invention. The smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives  worldwide. But smoke alarms don't prevent fires. Every year in the USA  over        are killed or injured with         home fires. And one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity. What if we could prevent electrical fires before they start  Well  a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this. So how does electricity ignite residential fires  Well it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring. Our invention had to address all of these issues. So what about circuit breakers  Well  Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in     . This is     year old technology  and this is a problem  because over    percent of all home electrical fires start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers. Hmmm ... So we considered all of this. And we realized that electrical appliances must be able to communicate directly with the power receptacle itself. Any electrical device    an appliance  an extension cord  whatever    must be able to tell the power outlet   Hey  power outlet  I'm drawing too much current. Shut me off now  before I start a fire.  And the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it. So here is what we did. We put a    cent digital transponder  a data tag  in the appliance plug. And we put an inexpensive  wireless data reader inside the receptacle so they could communicate. Now  every home electrical system becomes an intelligent network. The appliance's safe operating parameters are embedded into its plug. If too much current is flowing  the intelligent receptacle turns itself off  and prevents another fire from starting. We call this technology EFCI  Electrical Fault Circuit Interrupter. Okay  two more points. Every year in the USA  roughly       children are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries related to electrical receptacles. And this is crazy. An intelligent receptacle prevents injuries because the power is always off  until an intelligent plug is detected. Simple. Now  besides saving lives  perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power is in its energy savings. This invention will reduce global energy consumption by allowing remote control and automation of every outlet in every home and business. Now you can choose to reduce your home energy bill by automatically cycling heavy loads like air conditioners and heaters. Hotels and businesses can shut down unused rooms from a central location  or even a cell phone. There are    billion electrical outlets in North America alone. The potential energy savings is very  very significant. So far we've applied for     patent claims. Of those      have been granted      are in process. And I'm pleased to announce that just three weeks ago we received our first international recognition  the      CES Innovation Award. So  to conclude  intelligent power can  globally  save thousands of lives  prevent tens of thousands of injuries  and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage every single year  while significantly reducing global energy consumption. In the spirit of this year's TED Conference  we think this is a powerful  world changing invention. And I'd like to thank Chris for this opportunity to unveil our technology with you  and soon the world. Thank you. This is called Hooked on a Feeling  The Pursuit of Happiness and Human Design. I put up a somewhat dour Darwin  but a very happy chimp up there. My first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory. Man wishes to be happy  only wishes to be happy  and cannot wish not to be so. We are wired to pursue happiness  not only to enjoy it  but to want more and more of it. So given that that's true  how good are we at increasing our happiness  Well  we certainly try. If you look on the Amazon site  there are over       titles with advice on the seven habits  the nine choices  the    secrets  the        thoughts that are supposed to bring happiness. Now another way we try to increase our happiness is we medicate ourselves. And so there's over     million prescriptions out there for antidepressants. Prozac was really the first absolute blockbuster drug. It was clean  efficient  there was no high  there was really no danger  it had no street value. In       illegal drugs were a      billion business  representing eight percent of world trade  roughly the same as gas and oil. These routes to happiness haven't really increased happiness very much. One problem that's happening now is  although the rates of happiness are about as flat as the surface of the moon  depression and anxiety are rising. Some people say this is because we have better diagnosis  and more people are being found out. It isn't just that. We're seeing it all over the world. In the United States right now there are more suicides than homicides. There is a rash of suicide in China. And the World Health Organization predicts by the year      that depression will be the second largest cause of disability. Now the good news here is that if you take surveys from around the world  we see that about three quarters of people will say they are at least pretty happy. But this does not follow any of the usual trends. For example  these two show great growth in income  absolutely flat happiness curves. My field  the field of psychology  hasn't done a whole lot to help us move forward in understanding human happiness. In part  we have the legacy of Freud  who was a pessimist  who said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest  is propelled by infantile aspects of the individual that can never be met in reality. He said   One feels inclined to say that the intention that man should be happy is not included in the plan of creation.  So the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy was really what Freud called ordinary misery. And Freud in part reflects the anatomy of the human emotion system    which is that we have both a positive and a negative system  and our negative system is extremely sensitive. So for example  we're born loving the taste of something sweet and reacting aversively to the taste of something bitter. We also find that people are more averse to losing than they are happy to gain. The formula for a happy marriage is five positive remarks  or interactions  for every one negative. And that's how powerful the one negative is. Especially expressions of contempt or disgust  well you really need a lot of positives to upset that. I also put in here the stress response. We're wired for dangers that are immediate  that are physical  that are imminent  and so our body goes into an incredible reaction where endogenous opioids come in. We have a system that is really ancient  and really there for physical danger. And so over time  this becomes a stress response  which has enormous effects on the body. Cortisol floods the brain  it destroys hippocampal cells and memory  and can lead to all kinds of health problems. But unfortunately  we need this system in part. If we were only governed by pleasure we would not survive. We really have two command posts. Emotions are short lived intense responses to challenge and to opportunity. And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves that tune in  turn on  drop out thoughts  perceptions  feelings and memories. We tend to think of emotions as just feelings. But in fact  emotions are an all systems alert that change what we remember  what kind of decisions we make  and how we perceive things. So let me go forward to the new science of happiness. We've come away from the Freudian gloom  and people are now actively studying this. And one of the key points in the science of happiness is that happiness and unhappiness are not endpoints of a single continuum. The Freudian model is really one continuum that  as you get less miserable  you get happier. And that isn't true    when you get less miserable  you get less miserable. And that happiness is a whole other end of the equation. And it's been missing. It's been missing from psychotherapy. So when people's symptoms go away  they tend to recur  because there isn't a sense of the other half    of what pleasure  happiness  compassion  gratitude  what are the positive emotions. And of course we know this intuitively  that happiness is not just the absence of misery. But somehow it was not put forward until very recently  seeing these as two parallel systems. So that the body can both look for opportunity and also protect itself from danger  at the same time. And they're sort of two reciprocal and dynamically interacting systems. People have also wanted to deconstruct. We use this word  happy   and it's this very large umbrella of a term. And then three emotions for which there are no English words  fiero  which is the pride in accomplishment of a challenge  schadenfreude  which is happiness in another's misfortune  a malicious pleasure  and naches  which is a pride and joy in one's children. Absent from this list  and absent from any discussions of happiness  are happiness in another's happiness. We don't seem to have a word for that. We are very sensitive to the negative  but it is in part offset by the fact that we have a positivity. We're also born pleasure seekers. Babies love the taste of sweet and hate the taste of bitter. They love to touch smooth surfaces rather than rough ones. They like to look at beautiful faces rather than plain faces. They like to listen to consonant melodies instead of dissonant melodies. Babies really are born with a lot of innate pleasures. There was once a statement made by a psychologist that said that    percent of the pursuit of happiness is really just about the genes  and it's as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller. That's nonsense. There is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes    about    percent    but there is still that    percent that is unaccounted for. Let's just go into the brain for a moment  and see where does happiness arise from in evolution. We have basically at least two systems here  and they both are very ancient. One is the reward system  and that's fed by the chemical dopamine. And it starts in the ventral tegmental area. It goes to the nucleus accumbens  all the way up to the prefrontal cortex  orbital frontal cortex  where decisions are made  high level. This was originally seen as a system that was the pleasure system of the brain. In the     s  Olds and Milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat. And the rat would just keep pressing that bar thousands and thousands and thousands of times. It wouldn't eat. It wouldn't sleep. It wouldn't have sex. It wouldn't do anything but press this bar. So they assumed this must be  you know  the brain's orgasmatron. It turned out that it wasn't  that it really is a system of motivation  a system of wanting. It gives objects what's called incentive salience. It makes something look so attractive that you just have to go after it. That's something different from the system that is the pleasure system  which simply says   I like this.  The pleasure system  as you see  which is the internal opiates  there is a hormone oxytocin  is widely spread throughout the brain. Dopamine system  the wanting system  is much more centralized. The other thing about positive emotions is that they have a universal signal. And we see here the smile. And the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips to the zygomatic major. It's also crinkling the outer corner of the eye  the orbicularis oculi. So you see  even    month old babies  when they see their mother  will show this particular kind of smile. Extroverts use it more than introverts. People who are relieved of depression show it more after than before. So if you want to unmask a true look of happiness  you will look for this expression. Our pleasures are really ancient. And we learn  of course  many  many pleasures  but many of them are base. And one of them  of course  is biophilia    that we have a response to the natural world that's very profound. Very interesting studies done on people recovering from surgery  who found that people who faced a brick wall versus people who looked out on trees and nature  the people who looked out on the brick wall were in the hospital longer  needed more medication  and had more medical complications. There is something very restorative about nature  and it's part of how we are tuned. Humans  particularly so  we're very imitative creatures. And we imitate from almost the second we are born. Here is a three week old baby. And if you stick your tongue out at this baby  the baby will do the same. We are social beings from the beginning. And even studies of cooperation show that cooperation between individuals lights up reward centers of the brain. One problem that psychology has had is instead of looking at this intersubjectivity    or the importance of the social brain to humans who come into the world helpless and need each other tremendously    is that they focus instead on the self and self esteem  and not self other. It's sort of  me   not  we.  And I think this has been a really tremendous problem that goes against our biology and nature  and hasn't made us any happier at all. Because when you think about it  people are happiest when in flow  when they're absorbed in something out in the world  when they're with other people  when they're active  engaged in sports  focusing on a loved one  learning  having sex  whatever. They're not sitting in front of the mirror trying to figure themselves out  or thinking about themselves. These are not the periods when you feel happiest. The other thing is  that a piece of evidence is  is if you look at computerized text analysis of people who commit suicide  what you find there  and it's quite interesting  is use of the first person singular     I    me    my   not  we  and  us     and the letters are less hopeless than they are really alone. And being alone is very unnatural to the human. There is a profound need to belong. But there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up. Because  for example  the genes don't care whether we're happy  they care that we replicate  that we pass our genes on. So for example we have three systems that underlie reproduction  because it's so important. There's lust  which is just wanting to have sex. And that's really mediated by the sex hormones. Romantic attraction  that gets into the desire system. And that's dopamine fed. And that's   I must have this one person.  There's attachment  which is oxytocin  and the opiates  which says   This is a long term bond.  See the problem is that  as humans  these three can separate. So a person can be in a long term attachment  become romantically infatuated with someone else  and want to have sex with a third person. The other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray is in social status. We are very acutely aware of our social status and always seek to further and increase it. Now in the animal world  there is only one way to increase status  and that's dominance. I seize command by physical prowess  and I keep it by beating my chest  and you make submissive gestures. Now  the human has a whole other way to rise to the top  and that is a prestige route  which is freely conferred. Someone has expertise and knowledge  and knows how to do things  and we give that person status. And that's clearly the way for us to create many more niches of status so that people don't have to be lower on the status hierarchy as they are in the animal world. The data isn't terribly supportive of money buying happiness. But it's not irrelevant. So if you look at questions like this  life satisfaction  you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income. You see mental distress going up with lower income. So clearly there is some effect. But the effect is relatively small. And one of the problems with money is materialism. What happens when people pursue money too avidly  is they forget about the real basic pleasures of life. So we have here  this couple.  Do you think the less fortunate are having better sex   And then this kid over here is saying   Leave me alone with my toys.  So one of the things is that it really takes over. That whole dopamine wanting system takes over and derails from any of the pleasure system. Maslow had this idea back in the     s that as people rise above their biological needs  as the world becomes safer and we don't have to worry about basic needs being met    our biological system  whatever motivates us  is being satisfied    we can rise above them  to think beyond ourselves toward self actualization or transcendence  and rise above the materialist. So to just quickly conclude with some brief data that suggests this might be so. One is people who underwent what is called a quantum change  they felt their life and their whole values had changed. And sure enough  if you look at the kinds of values that come in  you see wealth  adventure  achievement  pleasure  fun  be respected  before the change  and much more post materialist values after. Women had a whole different set of value shifts. But very similarly  the only one that survived there was happiness. They went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self control to generosity and forgiveness. I end with a few quotes.  There is only one question  How to love this world   And Rilke   If your daily life seems poor  do not blame it  blame yourself. Tell yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches.   First  say to yourself what you would be. Then do what you have to do.  Thank you. Let me share with you today an original discovery. But I want to tell it to you the way it really happened    not the way I present it in a scientific meeting  or the way you'd read it in a scientific paper. It's a story about beyond biomimetics  to something I'm calling biomutualism. I define that as an association between biology and another discipline  where each discipline reciprocally advances the other  but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field. Now  in terms of biomimetics  as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature  nature becomes a much more useful teacher. Engineering can be inspired by biology by using its principles and analogies when they're advantageous  but then integrating that with the best human engineering  ultimately to make something actually better than nature. Now  being a biologist  I was very curious about this. These are gecko toes. And we wondered how they use these bizarre toes to climb up a wall so quickly. We discovered it. And what we found was that they have leaf like structures on their toes  with millions of tiny hairs that look like a rug  and each of those hairs has the worst case of split ends possible  about     to      split ends that are nano size. And the individual has   billion of these nano size split ends. They don't stick by Velcro or suction or glue. They actually stick by intermolecular forces alone  van der Waals forces. And I'm really pleased to report to you today that the first synthetic self cleaning  dry adhesive has been made. From the simplest version in nature  one branch  my engineering collaborator  Ron Fearing  at Berkeley  had made the first synthetic version. And so has my other incredible collaborator  Mark Cutkosky  at Stanford    he made much larger hairs than the gecko  but used the same general principles. And here is its first test. That's Kellar Autumn  my former Ph.D. student  professor now at Lewis and Clark  literally giving his first born child up for this test. More recently  this happened. Man  This the first time someone has actually climbed with it. Narrator  Lynn Verinsky  a professional climber  who appeared to be brimming with confidence. Lynn Verinsky  Honestly  it's going to be perfectly safe. It will be perfectly safe. Man  How do you know  Lynn Verinsky  Because of liability insurance.  Laughter  Narrator  With a mattress below and attached to a safety rope  Lynn began her    foot ascent. Lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing of Hollywood and science. Man  So you're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko. Lynn Verinsky  Ha  Wow. And what a privilege that has been. Robert Full  That's what she did on rough surfaces. But she actually used these on smooth surfaces    two of them    to climb up  and pull herself up. And you can try this in the lobby  and look at the gecko inspired material. Now the problem with the robots doing this is that they can't get unstuck  with the material. This is the gecko's solution. They actually peel their toes away from the surface  at high rates  as they run up the wall. Well I'm really excited today to show you the newest version of a robot  Stickybot  using a new hierarchical dry adhesive. Here is the actual robot. And here is what it does. And if you look  you can see that it uses the toe peeling  just like the gecko does. If we can show some of the video  you can see it climbing up the wall. There it is. And now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive that the Stanford group was able to do in designing this incredible robot. Oh. One thing I want to point out is  look at Stickybot. You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko. It has a tail. And just when you think you've figured out nature  this kind of thing happens. The engineers told us  for the climbing robots  that  if they don't have a tail  they fall off the wall. So what they did was they asked us an important question. They said   Well  it kind of looks like a tail.  Even though we put a passive bar there.  Do animals use their tails when they climb up walls   What they were doing was returning the favor  by giving us a hypothesis to test  in biology  that we wouldn't have thought of. So of course  in reality  we were then panicked  being the biologists  and we should know this already. We said   Well  what do tails do   Well we know that tails store fat  for example. We know that you can grab onto things with them. And perhaps it is most well known that they provide static balance. It can also act as a counterbalance. So watch this kangaroo. See that tail  That's incredible  Marc Raibert built a Uniroo hopping robot. And it was unstable without its tail. Now mostly tails limit maneuverability  like this human inside this dinosaur suit. My colleagues actually went on to test this limitation  by increasing the moment of inertia of a student  so they had a tail  and running them through and obstacle course  and found a decrement in performance  like you'd predict. But of course  this is a passive tail. And you can also have active tails. And when I went back to research this  I realized that one of the great TED moments in the past  from Nathan  we've talked about an active tail. Video  Myhrvold thinks tail cracking dinosaurs were interested in love  not war. Robert Full  He talked about the tail being a whip for communication. It can also be used in defense. Pretty powerful. So we then went back and looked at the animal. And we ran it up a surface. But this time what we did is we put a slippery patch that you see in yellow there. And watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail when it slips. This is slowed down    times. So here is normal speed. And watch it now slip  and see what it does with its tail. It has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg  and it contributes to stability. If you make it slip a huge amount  this is what we discovered. This is incredible. The engineers had a really good idea. And then of course we wondered  okay  they have an active tail  but let's picture them. They're climbing up a wall  or a tree. And they get to the top and let's say there's some leaves there. And what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf  and there was some wind  or we shook it  And we did that experiment  that you see here. And this is what we discovered. Now that's real time. You can't see anything. But there it is slowed down. What we discovered was the world's fastest air righting response. For those of you who remember your physics  that's a zero angular momentum righting response. But it's like a cat. You know  cats falling. Cats do this. They twist their bodies. But geckos do it better. And they do it with their tail. So they do it with this active tail as they swing around. And then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture. Okay  now we wondered  if we were right  we should be able to test this in a physical model  in a robot. So for TED we actually built a robot  over there  a prototype  with the tail. And we're going to attempt the first air righting response in a tail  with a robot. If we could have the lights on it. Okay  there it goes. And show the video. There it is. And it works just like it does in the animal. So all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself. Now  of course  we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations  so we thought   Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel. We'll blow the air up  we'll give it a landing target  a tree trunk  just outside the plexi glass enclosure  and see what it does. So we did. And here is what it does. So the wind is coming from the bottom. This is slowed down    times. It does an equilibrium glide. Highly controlled. This is sort of incredible. But actually it's quite beautiful  when you take a picture of it. And it's better than that  it    just in the slide    maneuvers in mid air. And the way it does it  is it takes its tail and it swings it one way to yaw left  and it swings its other way to yaw right. So we can maneuver this way. And then    we had to film this several times to believe this    it also does this. Watch this. It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin. It can actually swim through the air. But watch its front legs. Can you see what they are doing  What does that mean for the origin of flapping flight  Maybe it's evolved from coming down from trees  and trying to control a glide. Stay tuned for that. So then we wondered   Can they actually maneuver with this   So there is the landing target. Could they steer towards it with these capabilities  Here it is in the wind tunnel. And it certainly looks like it. You can see it even better from down on top. Watch the animal. Definitely moving towards the landing target. Watch the whip of its tail as it does it. Look at that. It's unbelievable. So now we were really confused  because there are no reports of it gliding. So we went   Oh my god  we have to go to the field  and see if it actually does this.  Completely opposite of the way you'd see it on a nature film  of course. We wondered   Do they actually glide in nature   Well we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia. And the next video you see is the first time we've showed this. This is the actual video    not staged  a real research video    of animal gliding down. There is a red trajectory line. Look at the end to see the animal. But then as it gets closer to the tree  look at the close up. And see if you can see it land. So there it comes down. There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line. You see it there  There  Watch it come down. Now watch up there and you can see the landing. Did you see it hit  It actually uses its tail too  just like we saw in the lab. So now we can continue this mutualism by suggesting that they can make an active tail. And here is the first active tail  in the robot  made by Boston Dynamics. So to conclude  I think we need to build biomutualisms  like I showed  that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application. To do this though  we need to redesign education in a major way  to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication  and explicitly train people how to contribute to  and benefit from other disciplines. And of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it. That is  whether you care about security  search and rescue or health  we must preserve nature's designs  otherwise these secrets will be lost forever. And from what I heard from our new president  I'm very optimistic. Thank you. Why do so many people reach success and then fail  One of the big reasons is  we think success is a one way street. So we do everything that leads up to success  but then we get there. We figure we've made it  we sit back in our comfort zone  and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful. And it doesn't take long to go downhill. And I can tell you this happens  because it happened to me. Reaching success  I worked hard  I pushed myself. But then I stopped  because I figured   Oh  you know  I made it. I can just sit back and relax.  Reaching success  I always tried to improve and do good work. But then I stopped because I figured   Hey  I'm good enough. I don't need to improve any more.  Reaching success  I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas. Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas. But then I stopped  because I figured I was this hot shot guy and I shouldn't have to work at ideas  they should just come like magic. And the only thing that came was creative block. I couldn't come up with any ideas. Reaching success  I always focused on clients and projects  and ignored the money. Then all this money started pouring in. And I got distracted by it. And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent  when I should have been talking to my clients. And reaching success  I always did what I loved. But then I got into stuff that I didn't love  like management. I am the world's worst manager  but I figured I should be doing it  because I was  after all  the president of the company. Well  soon a black cloud formed over my head and here I was  outwardly very successful  but inwardly very depressed. But I'm a guy  I knew how to fix it. I bought a fast car. It didn't help. I was faster but just as depressed. So I went to my doctor. I said   Doc  I can buy anything I want. But I'm not happy. I'm depressed. It's true what they say  and I didn't believe it until it happened to me. But money can't buy happiness.  He said   No. But it can buy Prozac.  And he put me on anti depressants. And yeah  the black cloud faded a little bit  but so did all the work  because I was just floating along. I couldn't care less if clients ever called. And clients didn't call. Because they could see I was no longer serving them  I was only serving myself. So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better. Well  it didn't take long for business to drop like a rock. My partner and I  Thom  we had to let all our employees go. It was down to just the two of us  and we were about to go under. And that was great. Because with no employees  there was nobody for me to manage. So I went back to doing the projects I loved. I had fun again  I worked harder and  to cut a long story short  did all the things that took me back up to success. But it wasn't a quick trip. It took seven years. But in the end  business grew bigger than ever. And when I went back to following these eight principles  the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether. And I woke up one day and I said   I don't need Prozac anymore.  And I threw it away and haven't needed it since. I learned that success isn't a one way street. It doesn't look like this  it really looks more like this. It's a continuous journey. And if we want to avoid  success to failure syndrome   we just keep following these eight principles  because that is not only how we achieve success  it's how we sustain it. So here is to your continued success. Thank you very much. I have had the distinct pleasure of living inside two biospheres. Of course we all here in this room live in Biosphere  . I've also lived in Biosphere  . And the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare biospheres. And hopefully from that I get to learn something. So what did I learn  Well  here I am inside Biosphere    making a pizza. So I am harvesting the wheat  in order to make the dough. And then of course I have to milk the goats and feed the goats in order to make the cheese. It took me four months in Biosphere   to make a pizza. Here in Biosphere    well it takes me about two minutes  because I pick up the phone and I call and say   Hey  can you deliver the pizza   So Biosphere   was essentially a three acre  entirely sealed  miniature world that I lived in for two years and    minutes. Over the top it was sealed with steel and glass  underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel    essentially entirely sealed. So we had our own miniature rainforest  a private beach with a coral reef. We had a savanna  a marsh  a desert. We had our own half acre farm that we had to grow everything. And of course we had our human habitat  where we lived. Back in the mid '  s when we were designing Biosphere    we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions. I mean  what is a biosphere  Back then  yes  I guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth  right  Well  you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one. And so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed    that is  nothing goes in or out at all  no material    and energetically open  which is essentially what planet Earth is. This is a chamber that was      th the size of Biosphere   that we called our Test Module. And the very first day that this fellow  John Allen  walked in  to spend a couple of days in there with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we'd put in there to hopefully keep him alive  the doctors were incredibly concerned that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin  or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something  fungus. But of course none of that happened. And over the ensuing few years  there were great sagas about designing Biosphere  . But by      we finally had this thing built. And it was time for us to go in and give it a go. We needed to know  is life this malleable  Can you take this biosphere  that has evolved on a planetary scale  and jam it into a little bottle  and will it survive  Big questions. And we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe    if we were going to go to Mars  for instance  would we take a biosphere with us  to live in it  We also wanted to know so we can understand more about the Earth that we all live in. Well  in      it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby. Let's take it on a maiden voyage. Will it work  Or will something happen that we can't understand and we can't fix  thereby negating the concept of man made biospheres  So eight of us went in  four men and four women. More on that later. And this is the world that we lived in. So  on the top  we had these beautiful rainforests and an ocean  and underneath we had all this technosphere  we called it  which is where all the pumps and the valves and the water tanks and the air handlers  and all of that. One of the Biospherians called it  garden of Eden on top of an aircraft carrier.  And then also we had the human habitat of course  with the laboratories  and all of that. This is the agriculture. It was essentially an organic farm. The day I walked into Biosphere    I was  for the first time  breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world  except seven other people. At that moment I became part of that biosphere. And I don't mean that in an abstract sense  I mean it rather literally. When I breathed out  my CO  fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing. And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes. And those sweet potatoes became part of me. In fact  we ate so many sweet potatoes I became orange with sweet potato. I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again. I was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way. When it came to our atmosphere  however  it wasn't that much of a joke over the long term  because it turned out that we were losing oxygen  quite a lot of oxygen. And we knew that we were losing CO . And so we were working to sequester carbon. Good lord    we know that term now. We were growing plants like crazy. We were taking their biomass  storing them in the basement  growing plants  going around  around  around  trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere. We were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere. We stopped irrigating our soil  as much as we could. We stopped tilling  so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air. But our oxygen was going down faster than our CO  was going up  which was quite unexpected  because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module. And it was like playing atomic hide and seek. We had lost seven tons of oxygen. And we had no clue where it was. And I tell you  when you lose a lot of oxygen    and our oxygen went down quite far  it went from    percent down to   .  percent    my goodness  do you feel dreadful. I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere. And we had sleep apnea at night. So you'd wake up gasping with breath  because your blood chemistry has changed. And that you literally do that. You stop breathing and then you     Gasps     take a breath and it wakes you up. And it's very irritating. And everybody outside thought we were dying. I mean  the media was making it sound like were were dying. And I had to call up my mother every other day saying   No  Mum  it's fine  fine. We're not dead. We're fine. We're fine.  And the doctor was  in fact  checking us to make sure we were  in fact  fine. But in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen. And one day he couldn't add up a line of figures. And it was time for us to put oxygen in. And you might think  well   Boy  your life support system was failing you. Wasn't that dreadful   Yes. In a sense it was terrifying. Except that I knew I could walk out the airlock door at any time  if it really got bad  though who was going to say   I can't take it anymore    Not me  that was for sure. But on the other hand  it was the scientific gold of the project  because we could really crank this baby up  as a scientific tool  and see if we could  in fact  find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone. And we did indeed find it. And we found it in the concrete. Essentially it had done something very simple. We had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost. It broke down  it took oxygen out of the air  it put CO  into the air  and it went into the concrete. Pretty straightforward really. So at the end of the two years when we came out  we were elated  because  in fact  although you might say we had discovered something that was quite  uhh   when your oxygen is going down  stopped working  essentially  in your life support system  that's a very bad failure. Except that we knew what it was. And we knew how to fix it. And nothing else emerged that really was as serious as that. And we proved the concept  more or less. People  on the other hand  was a different subject. We were    yeah I don't know that we were fixable. We all went quite nuts  I will say. And the day I came out of Biosphere    I was thrilled I was going to see all my family and my friends. For two years I'd been seeing people through the glass. And everybody ran up to me. And I recoiled. They stank  People stink  We stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant  and all kinds of stuff. Now we had stuff inside Biosphere to keep ourselves clean  but nothing with perfume. And boy do we stink out here. Not only that  but I lost touch of where my food came from. I had been growing all my own food. I had no idea what was in my food  where it came from. I didn't even recognize half the names in most of the food that I was eating. In fact  I would stand for hours in the aisles of shops  reading all the names on all of the things. People must have thought I was nuts. It was really quite astonishing. And I slowly lost track of where I was in this big biosphere  in this big biosphere that we all live in. In Biosphere   I totally understood that I had a huge impact on my biosphere  everyday  and it had an impact on me  very viscerally  very literally. So I went about my business  Paragon Space Development Corporation  a little firm I started with people while I was in the Biosphere  because I had nothing else to do. And one of the things we did was try to figure out  how small can you make these biospheres  and what can you do with them  And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station. We had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station  for    months  where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete multiple life cycles in space    really pushing the envelope of understanding how malleable our life systems are. And I'm also proud to announce that you're getting a sneak preview    on Friday we're going to announce that we're actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the Moon  which is going to be pretty fun. And the legacy of that is a system that we were designing  an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars. And part of that is that we had to model very rapid circulation of CO  and oxygen and water through this plant system. As a result of that modeling I ended up in all places  in Eritrea  in the Horn of Africa. Eritrea  formerly part of Ethiopia  is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful  incredibly stark  and I have no understanding of how people eke out a living there. It is so dry. This is what I saw. But this is also what I saw. I saw a company that had taken seawater and sand  and they were growing a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it. And it will produce a food crop. In this case it was oilseed. It was astonishing. They were also producing mangroves in a plantation. And the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals  so that they could produce milk and whatnot  like we had in the Biosphere. And all of it was coming from this  shrimp farms. Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth  frankly  from an environmental point of view. They pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean. They also pollute their next door neighbors. So they're all shitting each other's ponds  quite literally. And what this project was doing was taking the effluent of these  and turning them into all of this food. They were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people. They had created an industrial ecosystem  of a sense. I was there because I was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program  under the U.N. Kyoto Protocol system. And as I was modeling this mangrove swamp  I was thinking to myself   How do you put a box around this   When I'm modeling a plant in a box  literally  I know where to draw the boundary. In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea. Well  of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth. And understand its interactions with the entire Earth. And put your project in that context. Around the world today we're seeing an incredible transformation  from what I would call a biocidal species  one that    whether we intentionally or unintentionally    have designed our systems to kill life  a lot of the time. This is in fact  this beautiful photograph  is in fact over the Amazon. And here the light green are areas of massive deforestation. And those beautiful wispy clouds are  in fact  fires  human made fires. We're in the process of transforming from this  to what I would call a biophilic society  one where we learn to nurture society. Now it may not seem like it  but we are. It is happening all across the world  in every kind of walk of life  and every kind of career and industry that you can think of. And I think often times people get lost in that. They go   But how can I possibly find my way in that  It's such a huge subject.  And I would say that the small stuff counts. It really does. This is the story of a rake in my backyard. This was my backyard  very early on  when I bought my property. And in Arizona  of course  everybody puts gravel down. And they like to keep everything beautifully raked. And they keep all the leaves away. And on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out  and I want to throttle them. It's a certain type of aesthetic. We're very uncomfortable with untidiness. And I threw away my rake. And I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property. And over time  essentially what have I been doing  I've been building topsoil. And so now all the birds come in. And I have hawks. And I have an oasis. This is what happens every spring. For six weeks  six to eight weeks  I have this flush of green oasis. This is actually in a riparian area. And all of Tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake. The small stuff counts. The Industrial Revolution    and Prometheus    has given us this  the ability to light up the world. It has also given us this  the ability to look at the world from the outside. Now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to  and compare it to this biosphere. But we can look at the world  and try to understand where we are in its context  and how we choose to interact with it. And if you lose where you are in your biosphere  or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting with where you are in the biosphere  I would say to you  take a deep breath. The yogis had it right. Breath does  in fact  connect us all in a very literal way. Take a breath now. And as you breathe  think about what is in your breath. There perhaps is the CO  from the person sitting next door to you. Maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here. It also connects us in time. There may be some carbon in your breath from the dinosaurs. There could also be carbon that you are exhaling now that will be in the breath of your great great great grandchildren. Thank you.  Applause  I want to talk about the transformed media landscape  and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world. And I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation. I'll start here. Last November there was a presidential election. You probably read something about it in the papers. And there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression. And so a plan came up to video the vote. And the idea was that individual citizens with phones capable of taking photos or making video would document their polling places  on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques  and would upload this to a central place. And that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation    that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes  but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall. So this is a pattern that assumes we're all in this together. What matters here isn't technical capital  it's social capital. These tools don't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring. It isn't when the shiny new tools show up that their uses start permeating society. It's when everybody is able to take them for granted. Because now that media is increasingly social  innovation can happen anywhere that people can take for granted the idea that we're all in this together. And so we're starting to see a media landscape in which innovation is happening everywhere  and moving from one spot to another. That is a huge transformation. Not to put too fine a point on it  the moment we're living through    the moment our historical generation is living through    is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history. Now that's a big claim. I'm going to try to back it up. There are only four periods in the last     years where media has changed enough to qualify for the label  revolution.  The first one is the famous one  the printing press  movable type  oil based inks  that whole complex of innovations that made printing possible and turned Europe upside down  starting in the middle of the     s. Then  a couple of hundred years ago  there was innovation in two way communication  conversational media  first the telegraph  then the telephone. Slow  text based conversations  then real time voice based conversations. Then  about     years ago  there was a revolution in recorded media other than print  first photos  then recorded sound  then movies  all encoded onto physical objects. And finally  about     years ago  the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum to send sound and images through the air    radio and television. This is the media landscape as we knew it in the   th century. This is what those of us of a certain age grew up with  and are used to. But there is a curious asymmetry here. The media that is good at creating conversations is no good at creating groups. And the media that's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations. If you want to have a conversation in this world  you have it with one other person. If you want to address a group  you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group  whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press. That was the media landscape as we had it in the twentieth century. And this is what changed. This thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen is Bill Cheswick's map of the Internet. He traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes them. The Internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time. Whereas the phone gave us the one to one pattern  and television  radio  magazines  books  gave us the one to many pattern  the Internet gives us the many to many pattern. For the first time  media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations. That's one of the big changes. The second big change is that  as all media gets digitized  the Internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media  meaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet  magazines migrate to the Internet  movies migrate to the Internet. And that means that every medium is right next door to every other medium. Put another way  media is increasingly less just a source of information  and it is increasingly more a site of coordination  because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well. And the third big change is that members of the former audience  as Dan Gilmore calls them  can now also be producers and not consumers. Every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well  because the same equipment    phones  computers    let you consume and produce. It's as if  when you bought a book  they threw in the printing press for free  it's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right buttons. That is a huge change in the media landscape we're used to. And it's not just Internet or no Internet. We've had the Internet in its public form for almost    years now  and it's still changing as the media becomes more social. It's still changing patterns even among groups who know how to deal with the Internet well. Second story. Last May  China in the Sichuan province had a terrible earthquake   .  magnitude  massive destruction in a wide area  as the Richter Scale has it. And the earthquake was reported as it was happening. People were texting from their phones. They were taking photos of buildings. They were taking videos of buildings shaking. They were uploading it to QQ  China's largest Internet service. They were Twittering it. And so as the quake was happening the news was reported. And because of the social connections  Chinese students coming elsewhere  and going to school  or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China    there were people listening all over the world  hearing this news. The BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter. Twitter announced the existence of the quake several minutes before the US Geological Survey had anything up online for anybody to read. The last time China had a quake of that magnitude it took them three months to admit that it had happened. Now they might have liked to have done that here  rather than seeing these pictures go up online. But they weren't given that choice  because their own citizens beat them to the punch. Even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens  rather than from the Xinhua News Agency. And this stuff rippled like wildfire. For a while there the top    most clicked links on Twitter  the global short messaging service    nine of the top    links were about the quake. People collating information  pointing people to news sources  pointing people to the US geological survey. The   th one was kittens on a treadmill  but that's the Internet for you. But nine of the    in those first hours. And within half a day donation sites were up  and donations were pouring in from all around the world. This was an incredible  coordinated global response. And the Chinese then  in one of their periods of media openness  decided that they were going to let it go  that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly. And then this happened. People began to figure out  in the Sichuan Provence  that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed    because tragically the earthquake happened during a school day    the reason so many school buildings collapsed is that corrupt officials had taken bribes to allow those building to be built to less than code. And so they started  the citizen journalists started reporting that as well. And there was an incredible picture. You may have seen in on the front page of the New York Times. A local official literally prostrated himself in the street  in front of these protesters  in order to get them to go away. Essentially to say   We will do anything to placate you  just please stop protesting in public.  But these are people who have been radicalized  because  thanks to the one child policy  they have lost everyone in their next generation. Someone who has seen the death of a single child now has nothing to lose. And so the protest kept going. And finally the Chinese cracked down. That was enough of citizen media. And so they began to arrest the protesters. They began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on. China is probably the most successful manager of Internet censorship in the world  using something that is widely described as the Great Firewall of China. And the Great Firewall of China is a set of observation points that assume that media is produced by professionals  it mostly comes in from the outside world  it comes in relatively sparse chunks  and it comes in relatively slowly. And because of those four characteristics they are able to filter it as it comes into the country. But like the Maginot Line  the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge  because not one of those four things was true in this environment. The media was produced locally. It was produced by amateurs. It was produced quickly. And it was produced at such an incredible abundance that there was no way to filter it as it appeared. And so now the Chinese government  who for a dozen years  has quite successfully filtered the web  is now in the position of having to decide whether to allow or shut down entire services  because the transformation to amateur media is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other way. And in fact that is happening this week. On the   th anniversary of Tiananmen they just  two days ago  announced that they were simply shutting down access to Twitter  because there was no way to filter it other than that. They had to turn the spigot entirely off. Now these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages. They also affect people who want to send messages  because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole  not just a particular strategy. The classic media problem  from the   th century is  how does an organization have a message that they want to get out to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network. And here is the twentieth century answer. Bundle up the message. Send the same message to everybody. National message. Targeted individuals. Relatively sparse number of producers. Very expensive to do  so there is not a lot of competition. This is how you reach people. All of that is over. We are increasingly in a landscape where media is global  social  ubiquitous and cheap. Now most organizations that are trying to send messages to the outside world  to the distributed collection of the audience  are now used to this change. The audience can talk back. And that's a little freaky. But you can get used to it after a while  as people do. But that's not the really crazy change that we're living in the middle of. The really crazy change is here  it's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other  the fact that former consumers are now producers  the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another  because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals  and because the size of the network  the complexity of the network is actually the square of the number of participants  meaning that the network  when it grows large  grows very  very large. As recently at last decade  most of the media that was available for public consumption was produced by professionals. Those days are over  never to return. It is the green lines now  that are the source of the free content  which brings me to my last story. We saw some of the most imaginative use of social media during the Obama campaign. And I don't mean most imaginative use in politics    I mean most imaginative use ever. And one of the things Obama did  was they famously  the Obama campaign did  was they famously put up MyBarackObama.com  myBO.com And millions of citizens rushed in to participate  and to try and figure out how to help. An incredible conversation sprung up there. And then  this time last year  Obama announced that he was going to change his vote on FISA  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. He had said  in January  that he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on American persons. By the summer  in the middle of the general campaign  He said   I've thought about the issue more. I've changed my mind. I'm going to vote for this bill.  And many of his own supporters on his own site went very publicly berserk. It was Senator Obama when they created it. They changed the name later.  Please get FISA right.  Within days of this group being created it was the fastest growing group on myBO.com  within weeks of its being created it was the largest group. Obama had to issue a press release. He had to issue a reply. And he said essentially   I have considered the issue. I understand where you are coming from. But having considered it all  I'm still going to vote the way I'm going to vote. But I wanted to reach out to you and say  I understand that you disagree with me  and I'm going to take my lumps on this one.  This didn't please anybody. But then a funny thing happened in the conversation. People in that group realized that Obama had never shut them down. Nobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join  to deny its existence  to delete it  to take to off the site. They had understood that their role with myBO.com was to convene their supporters but not to control their supporters. And that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media. Media  the media landscape that we knew  as familiar as it was  as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs  is increasingly slipping away. In a world where media is global  social  ubiquitous and cheap  in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants  in that world  media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals. It is more and more often a way of creating an environment for convening and supporting groups. And the choice we face  I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world  isn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in. That's the media environment we've got. The question we all face now is   How can we make best use of this media  Even though it means changing the way we've always done it.  Thank you very much. My journey to coming here today started in     . That's me with the funny gloves. I was    and going on a peace walk. What I didn't know though  was most of those people  standing there with me  were Moonies. And within a week I had come to believe that the second coming of Christ had occurred  that it was Sun Myung Moon  and that I had been specially chosen and prepared by God to be his disciple. Now as cool as that sounds  my family was not that thrilled with this. And they tried everything they could to get me out of there. There was an underground railroad of sorts that was going on during those years. Maybe some of you remember it. They were called deprogrammers. And after about five long years my family had me deprogrammed. And I then became a deprogrammer. I started going out on cases. And after about five years of doing this  I was arrested for kidnapping. Most of the cases I went out on were called involuntary. What happened was that the family had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow. And so they took them to some safe place. And we would come in and talk to them  usually for about a week. And so after this happened  I decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work. And about    years went by. There was a burning question though that would not leave me. And that was   How did this happen to me   And in fact  what did happen to my brain  Because something did. And so I decided to write a book  a memoir  about this decade of my life. And toward the end of writing that book there was a documentary that came out. It was on Jonestown. And it had a chilling effect on me. These are the dead in Jonestown. About     people died that day  most of them taking their own lives. Women gave poison to their babies  and watched foam come from their mouths as they died. The top picture is a group of Moonies that have been blessed by their messiah. Their mates were chosen for them. The bottom picture is Hitler youth. This is the leg of a suicide bomber. The thing I had to admit to myself  with great repulsion  was that I get it. I understand how this could happen. I understand how someone's brain  how someone's mind can come to the place where it makes sense    in fact it would be wrong  when your brain is working like that    not to try to save the world through genocide. And so what is this  How does this work  And how I've come to view what happened to me is a viral  memetic infection. For those of you who aren't familiar with memetics  a meme has been defined as an idea that replicates in the human brain and moves from brain to brain like a virus  much like a virus. The way a virus works is    it can infect and do the most damage to someone who has a compromised immune system. In       I was young  I was naive  and I was pretty lost in my world. I was really idealistic. These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable. What happens is that circular logic takes over.  Moon is one with God. God is going to fix all the problems in the world. All I have to do is humbly follow. Because God is going to stop war and hunger    all these things I wanted to do    all I have to do is humbly follow. Because after all  God is  working through  the messiah. He's going to fix all this.  It becomes impenetrable. And the most dangerous part of this is that is creates  us  and  them    right  and  wrong    good  and  evil.  And it makes anything possible  makes anything rationalizable. And the thing is  though  if you looked at my brain during those years in the Moonies    neuroscience is expanding exponentially  as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. Science is expanding. We're beginning to look inside the brain. And so if you looked at my brain  or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this  and compared it to anyone in this room  or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis  I am convinced it would look very  very different. And that  strange as it may sound  gives me hope. And the reason that gives me hope is that the first thing is to admit that we have a problem. But it's a human problem. It's a scientific problem  if you will. It happens in the human brain. There is no evil force out there to get us. And so this is something that  through research and education  I believe that we can solve. And so the first step is to realize that we can do this together  and that there is no  us  and  them.  Thank you very much.  Applause  A talk about surgical robots is also a talk about surgery. And while I've tried to make my images not too graphic  keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do  because  after all  what a surgeon does to a patient  if it were done without consent  would be a felony. Surgeons are the tailors  the plumbers  the carpenters    some would say the butchers    of the medical world  cutting  reshaping  reforming  bypassing  fixing. But you need to talk about surgical instruments and the evolution of surgical technology together. So in order to give you some kind of a perspective of where we are right now with surgical robots  and where we're going to be going in the future  I want to give you a little bit of perspective of how we got to this point  how we even came to believe that surgery was OK  that this was something that was possible to do  that this kind of cutting and reforming was OK. So  a little bit of perspective    about        years of perspective. This is a trephinated skull. And trephination is simply just cutting a hole in the skull. And many  many hundreds of skulls like this have been found in archaeological sites all over the world  dating back five to    thousand years. Five to    thousand years  Now imagine this. You are a healer in a Stone Age village. And you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him    Oliver Sacks is going to be born way in the future. He's got some seizure disorder. And you don't understand this. But you think to yourself   I'm not quite sure what's wrong with this guy. But maybe if I cut a hole in his head I can fix it.  Now that is surgical thinking. Now we've got the dawn of interventional surgery here. What is astonishing about this is  even though we don't know really how much of this was intended to be religious  or how much of it was intended to be therapeutic  what we can tell is that these patients lived  Judging by the healing on the borders of these holes  they lived days  months  years following trephination. And so what we are seeing is evidence of a refined technique that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years  all over the world. This arose independently at sites everywhere that had no communication to one another. We really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery. Now we can fast forward many thousands of years into the Bronze Age and beyond. And we see new refined tools coming out. But surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold  trephinating ancestors. These guys confined their surgery to fairly superficial injuries. And surgeons were tradesmen  rather than physicians. This persisted all the way into and through the Renaissance. That may have saved the writers  but it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much. They were still a mistrusted lot. Surgeons still had a bit of a PR problem  because the landscape was dominated by the itinerant barber surgeon. These were folks that traveled from village to village  town to town  doing surgery sort of as a form of performance art. Because we were in the age before anesthesia  the agony of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the surgery itself. One of the most famous of these guys  Frere Jacques  shown here doing a lithotomy    which is the removal of the bladder stone  one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time    had to take less than two minutes. You had to have quite a flair for the dramatic  and be really  really quick. And so here you see him doing a lithotomy. And he is credited with doing over       of these public surgeries  wandering around in Europe  which is an astonishing number  when you think that surgery must have been a last resort. I mean who would put themselves through that  Until anesthesia  the absence of sensation. With the demonstration of the Morton Ether Inhaler at the Mass. General in       a whole new era of surgery was ushered in. Anesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate. Anesthesia gave them the freedom to experiment  to start to delve deeper into the body. This was truly a revolution in surgery. But there was a pretty big problem with this. After these very long  painstaking operations  attempting to cure things they'd never been able to touch before  the patients died. They died of massive infection. Surgery didn't hurt anymore  but it killed you pretty quickly. And infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients until the next big revolution in surgery  which was aseptic technique. Joseph Lister was aepsis's  or sterility's  biggest advocate  to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons. But eventually they did come around. The Mayo brothers came out to visit Lister in Europe. And they came back to their American clinic and they said they had learned it was as important to wash your hands before doing surgery as it was to wash up afterwards.  Laughter  Something so simple. And yet  operative mortality dropped profoundly. These surgeries were actually now being effective. With the patient insensitive to pain  and a sterile operating field all bets were off  the sky was the limit. You could now start doing surgery everywhere  on the gut  on the liver  on the heart  on the brain. Transplantation  you could take an organ out of one person  you could put it in another person  and it would work. Surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore  they had become gods. The era of the  big surgeon  big incision  had arrived  but at quite a cost  because they are saving lives  but not necessarily quality of life  because healthy people don't usually need surgery  and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that. The question had to be asked   Well  can we do these same surgeries but through little incisions   Laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery  surgery with long instruments through small incisions. And it really changed the landscape of surgery. Some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years  but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique until the     s  when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that  that allowed this to be done for real operations. So what you see    this is now the first surgical image    as we're coming down the tube  this is a new entry into the body. It looks very different from what you're expecting surgery to look like. We bring instruments in  from two separate cuts in the side  and then you can start manipulating tissue. Within    years of the first gallbladder surgeries being done laparoscopically  a majority of gallbladder surgeries were being done laparoscopically    truly a pretty big revolution. But there were casualties of this revolution. These techniques were a lot harder to learn than people had anticipated. The learning curve was very long. And during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher. Surgeons had to give up their  D vision. They had to give up their wrists. They had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments. This surgeon has over       hours of laparoscopic experience. Now this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle. But this is hard. And one of the reasons why it is so hard is because the external ergonomics are terrible. You've got these long instruments  and you're working off your centerline. And the instruments are essentially working backwards. So what you need to do  to take the capability of your hand  and put it on the other side of that small incision  is you need to put a wrist on that instrument. And so    I get to talk about robots    the da Vinci robot put just that wrist on the other side of that incision. And so here you're seeing the operation of this wrist. And now  in contrast to the laparoscopy  you can precisely place the needle in your instruments  and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory. And the reason why this becomes so much easier is    you can see on the bottom    the hands are making the motions  and the instruments are following those motions exactly. Now  what you put between those instruments and those hands  is a large  fairly complicated robot. The surgeon is sitting at a console  and controlling the robot with these controllers. And the robot is moving these instruments around  and powering them  down inside the body. You have a  D camera  so you get a  D view. And since this was introduced in       a lot of these robots have been out and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy  which is a prostate deep in the pelvis  and it requires fine dissection and delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical outcome. You can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart without cracking the chest. This is all done in between the ribs. And you can go inside the heart itself and repair the valves from the inside. You've got these technologies    thank you    And so you might say   Wow this is really cool  So  smartypants  why isn't all surgery being done this way   And there are some reasons  some good reasons. And cost is one of them. I talked about the large  complicated robot. With all its bells and whistles  one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon. More useful than a solid gold surgeon  but  still  it's a fairly big capital investment. But once you've got it  your procedure costs do come down. But there are other barriers. So something like a prostatectomy    the prostate is small  and it's in one spot  and you can set your robot up very precisely to work in that one spot. And so it's perfect for something like that. And in fact if you  or anyone you know  had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years  chances are it was done with one of these systems. But if you need to reach more places than just one  you need to move the robot. And you need to put some new incisions in there. And you need to re set it up. And then you need to add some more ports  and more. And the problem is it gets time consuming  and cumbersome. And for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren't being done with the da Vinci. So we had to ask the question   Well how do we fix that   What if we could change it so that we didn't have to re set up each time we wanted to move somewhere different  What if we could bring all the instruments in together in one place  How would that change the capabilities of the surgeon  And how would that change the experience for the patient  Now  to do that  we need to be able to bring a camera and instruments in together through one small tube  like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video. Or  not so coincidentally  like a tube like this. So what's going to come out of that tube is the debut of this new technology  this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere. Ready  So here it comes. This is the camera  and three instruments. And as you see it come out  in order to actually be able to do anything useful  it can't all stay clustered up like this. It has to be able to come off of the centerline and then be able to work back toward that centerline. He's a cheeky little devil. But what this lets you do is gives you that all important traction  and counter traction  so that you can dissect  so that you can sew  so that you can do all the things that you need to do  all the surgical tasks. But it's all coming in through one incision. It's not so simple. But it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we're going around. For the patient  however  it's transparent. This is all they're going to see. It's very exciting to think where we get to go with this. We get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery. As we take these capabilities  and we get to go to the next places  we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be. And I think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution  we need to not just take our hands in in new ways  we also need to take our eyes in in new ways. We need to see beyond the surface. We need to be able to guide what we're cutting in a much better way. This is a cancer surgery. One of the problems with this  even for surgeons who've been looking at this a lot  is you can't see the cancer  especially when it's hidden below the surface. And so what we're starting to do is we're starting to inject specially designed markers into the bloodstream that will target the cancer. It will go  bind to the cancer. And we can make those markers glow. And we can take special cameras  and we can look at it. Now we know where we need to cut  even when it's below the surface. We can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site. And we can follow where they flow out from that tumor site  so we can see the first places where that cancer might travel. We can inject these dyes into the bloodstream  so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart  we can see if we actually made the connection  before we close that patient back up again    something that we haven't been able to do without radiation before. We can light up tumors like this kidney tumor  so that you can exactly see where the boundary is between the kidney tumor and the kidney you want to leave behind  or the liver tumor and the liver you want to leave behind. And we don't even need to confine ourselves to this macro vision. We have flexible microscopic probes that we can bring down into the body. And we can look at cells directly. I'm looking at nerves here. So these are nerves you see  down on the bottom  and the microscope probe that's being held by the robotic hand  up at the top. So this is all very prototypey at this point. But you care about nerves  if you are a surgical patient. Because they let you keep continence  bladder control  and sexual function after surgery  all of which is generally fairly important to the patient. So  with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all  and we can see it all. We can heal the disease. And we can leave the patient whole and intact and functional afterwards. Now  I've talked about the patient as if the patient is  somehow  someone abstract outside this room. And that is not the case. Many of you  all of you maybe  will at some point  or have already  faced a diagnosis of cancer  or heart disease  or some organ dysfunction that's going to buy you a date with a surgeon. And when you get to that point    I mean  these maladies don't care how many books you've written  how many companies you've started  that Nobel Prize you have yet to win  how much time you planned to spend with your children. These maladies come for us all. And the prospect I'm offering you  of an easier surgery ... is that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying  I'm not sure I really even want it to. Because facing your own mortality causes a re evaluation of priorities  and a realignment of what your goals are in life  unlike anything else. And I would never want to deprive you of that epiphany. What I want instead  is for you to be whole  intact  and functional enough to go out and save the world  after you've decided you need to do it. And that is my vision for your future. Thank you. I want to share with you some ideas about the secret power of time  in a very short time. Video  All right  start the clock please.    seconds studio. Keep it quiet please. Settle down. It's about time. End sequence. Take one.    seconds studio.     nine  eight  seven  six  five  four  three  two ... Philip Zimbardo  Let's tune into the conversation of the principals in Adam's temptation.  Come on Adam  don't be so wishy washy. Take a bite.   I did.   One bite  Adam. Don't abandon Eve.   I don't know  guys. I don't want to get in trouble.   Okay. One bite. What the hell   Life is temptation. It's all about yielding  resisting  yes  no  now  later  impulsive  reflective  present focus and future focus. Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment. Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage    thank you George Bush    the majority     percent  yielded to sexual temptations within one year. And most of them did so without using birth control. So much for promises. Now lets tempt four year olds  giving them a treat. They can have one marshmallow now. But if they wait until the experimenter comes back  they can have two. Of course it pays  if you like marshmallows  to wait. What happens is two thirds of the kids give in to temptation. They cannot wait. The others  of course  wait. They resist the temptation. They delay the now for later. Walter Mischel  my colleague at Stanford  went back    years later  to try to discover what was different about those kids. There were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded  in many ways. The kids who resisted scored     points higher on the SAT. That's enormous. That's like a whole set of different IQ points. They didn't get in as much trouble. They were better students. They were self confident and determined. And the key for me today  the key for you  is  they were future focused rather than present focused. So what is time perspective  That's what I'm going to talk about today. Time perspective is the study of how individuals  all of us  divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories. And you do it automatically and non consciously. They vary between cultures  between nations  between individuals  between social classes  between education levels. And the problem is that they can become biased  because you learn to over use some of them and under use the others. What determines any decision you make  You make a decision on which you're going to base an action. For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation  what other people are doing and what you're feeling. And those people  when they make their decisions in that format    we're going to call them  present oriented   because their focus is what is now. For others  the present is irrelevant. It's always about  What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past   So that their decisions are based on past memories. And we're going to call those people  past oriented   because they focus on what was. For others it's not the past  it's not the present  it's only about the future. Their focus is always about anticipated consequences. Cost benefit analysis. We're going to call them  future oriented.  Their focus is on what will be. So  time paradox  I want to argue  the paradox of time perspective  is something that influences every decision you make  you're totally unaware of. Namely  the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives. Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present oriented. There is two ways to be past oriented  two ways to be future. You can focus on past positive  or past negative. You can be present hedonistic  namely you focus on the joys of life  or present fatalist    it doesn't matter  your life is controlled. You can be future oriented  setting goals. Or you can be transcendental future  namely  life begins after death. Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation  that's what you've got to learn to do. So  very quickly  what is the optimal time profile  High on past positive. Moderately high on future. And moderate on present hedonism. And always low on past negative and present fatalism. So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past    past positive gives you roots. You connect your family  identity and your self. What you get from the future is wings to soar to new destinations  new challenges. What you get from the present hedonism is the energy  the energy to explore yourself  places  people  sensuality. Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives. What do futures sacrifice for success  They sacrifice family time. They sacrifice friend time. They sacrifice fun time. They sacrifice personal indulgence. They sacrifice hobbies. And they sacrifice sleep. So it affects their health. And they live for work  achievement and control. I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters. And it resonated for me. I grew up as a poor kid in the South Bronx ghetto  a Sicilian family    everyone lived in the past and present. I'm here as a future oriented person who went over the top  who did all these sacrifices because teachers intervened  and made me future oriented. Told me don't eat that marshmallow  because if you wait you're going to get two of them  until I learned to balance out. I've added present hedonism  I've added a focus on the past positive  so  at    years old  I am more energetic than ever  more productive  and I'm happier than I have ever been. I just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems  changing the drop out rates of school kids  combating addictions  enhancing teen health  curing vets' PTSD with time metaphors    getting miracle cures    promoting sustainability and conservation  reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a    percent drop out rate  altering appeals to suicidal terrorists  and modifying family conflicts as time zone clashes. So I want to end by saying  many of life's puzzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others. And the idea is so simple  so obvious  but I think the consequences are really profound. Thank you so much. I'm going to talk about post conflict recovery and how we might do post conflict recovery better. The record on post conflict recovery is not very impressive.    percent of all post conflict situations  historically  have reverted back to conflict within a decade. In fact  they've accounted for half of all civil wars. Why has the record been so poor  Well  the conventional approach to post conflict situations has rested on  on kind of  three principles. The first principle is  it's the politics that matters. So  the first thing that is prioritized is politics. Try and build a political settlement first. And then the second step is to say   The situation is admittedly dangerous  but only for a short time.  So get peacekeepers there  but get them home as soon as possible. So  short term peacekeepers. And thirdly  what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers  It's an election. That will produce a legitimate and accountable government. So that's the conventional approach. I think that approach denies reality. We see that there is no quick fix. There's certainly no quick security fix. I've tried to look at the risks of reversion to conflict  during our post conflict decade. And the risks stay high throughout the decade. And they stay high regardless of the political innovations. Does an election produce an accountable and legitimate government  What an election produces is a winner and a loser. And the loser is unreconciled. The reality is that we need to reverse the sequence. It's not the politics first  it's actually the politics last. The politics become easier as the decade progresses if you're building on a foundation of security and economic development    the rebuilding of prosperity. Why does the politics get easier  And why is it so difficult initially  Because after years of stagnation and decline  the mentality of politics is that it's a zero sum game. If the reality is stagnation  I can only go up if you go down. And that doesn't produce a productive politics. And so the mentality has to shift from zero sum to positive sum before you can get a productive politics. You can only get positive  that mental shift  if the reality is that prosperity is being built. And in order to build prosperity  we need security in place. So that is what you get when you face reality. But the objective of facing reality is to change reality. And so now let me suggest two complimentary approaches to changing the reality of the situations. The first is to recognize the interdependence of three key actors  who are different actors  and at the moment are uncoordinated. The first actor is the Security Council. The Security Council typically has the responsibility for providing the peacekeepers who build the security. And that needs to be recognized  first of all  that peacekeeping works. It is a cost effective approach. It does increase security. But it needs to be done long term. It needs to be a decade long approach  rather than just a couple of years. That's one actor  the Security Council. The second actor  different cast of guys  is the donors. The donors provide post conflict aid. Typically in the past  the donors have been interested in the first couple of years  and then they got bored. They moved on to some other situation. Post conflict economic recovery is a slow process. There are no quick processes in economics except decline. You can do that quite fast. So the donors have to stick with this situation for at least a decade. And then the third key actor is the post conflict government. And there are two key things it's got to do. One is it's got to do economic reform  not fuss about the political constitution. It's got to reform economic policy. Why  Because during conflict economic policy typically deteriorates. Governments snatch short term opportunities and  by the end of the conflict  the chickens have come home to roost. So this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy. So there is a reform agenda  and there is an inclusion agenda. The inclusion agenda doesn't come from elections. Elections produce a loser  who is then excluded. So the inclusion agenda means genuinely bringing people inside the tent. So those three actors. And they are interdependent over a long term. If the Security Council doesn't commit to security over the course of a decade  you don't get the reassurance which produces private investment. If you don't get the policy reform and the aid  you don't get the economic recovery  which is the true exit strategy for the peacekeepers. So we should recognize that interdependence  by formal  mutual commitments. The United Nations actually has a language for these mutual commitments  the recognition of mutual commitments  it's called the language of compact. And so we need a post conflict compact. The United Nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts  it's called the Peace Building Commission. It would be ideal to have a standard set of norms where  when we got to a post conflict situation  there was an expectation of these mutual commitments from the three parties. So that's idea one  recognize interdependence. And now let me turn to the second approach  which is complimentary. And that is to focus on a few critical objectives. Typical post conflict situation is a zoo of different actors with different priorities. And indeed  unfortunately  if you navigate by needs you get a very unfocused agenda  because in these situations  needs are everywhere  but the capacity to implement change is very limited. So we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical. And I want to suggest that in the typical post conflict situation three things are critical. One is jobs. One is improvements in basic services    especially health  which is a disaster during conflict. So jobs  health  and clean government. Those are the three critical priorities. So I'm going to talk a little about each of them. Jobs. What is a distinctive approach to generating jobs in post conflict situations  And why are jobs so important  Jobs for whom  Especially jobs for young men. In post conflict situations  the reason that they so often revert to conflict  is not because elderly women get upset. It's because young men get upset. And why are they upset  Because they have nothing to do. And so we need a process of generating jobs  for ordinary young men  fast. Now  that is difficult. Governments in post conflict situation often respond by puffing up the civil service. That is not a good idea. It's not sustainable. In fact  you're building a long term liability by inflating civil service. But getting the private sector to expand is also difficult  because any activity which is open to international trade is basically going to be uncompetitive in a post conflict situation. These are not environments where you can build export manufacturing. There's one sector which isn't exposed to international trade  and which can generate a lot of jobs  and which is  in any case  a sensible sector to expand  post conflict  and that is the construction sector. The construction sector has a vital role  obviously  in reconstruction. But typically that sector has withered away during conflict. During conflict people are doing destruction. There isn't any construction going on. And so the sector shrivels away. And then when you try and expand it  because it's shriveled away  you encounter a lot of bottlenecks. Basically  prices soar and crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector  but it doesn't generate any jobs. And so the policy priority is to break the bottlenecks in expanding the construction sector. What might the bottlenecks be  Just think what you have to do successfully to build a structure  using a lot of labor. First you need access to land. Often the legal system is broken down so you can't even get access to land. Secondly you need skills  the mundane skills of the construction sector. In post conflict situations we don't just need Doctors Without Borders  we need Bricklayers Without Borders  to rebuild the skill set. We need firms. The firms have gone away. So we need to encourage the growth of local firms. If we do that  we not only get the jobs  we get the improvements in public infrastructure  the restoration of public infrastructure. Let me turn from jobs to the second objective  which is improving basic social services. And to date  there has been a sort of a schizophrenia in the donor community  as to how to build basic services in post conflict sectors. On the one hand it pays lip service to the idea of rebuild an effective state in the image of Scandinavia in the     s. Lets develop line ministries of this  that  and the other  that deliver these services. And it's schizophrenic because in their hearts donors know that's not a realistic agenda  and so what they also do is the total bypass  just fund NGOs. Neither of those approaches is sensible. And so what I'd suggest is what I call Independent Service Authorities. It's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three. The planning function and policy function stays with the ministry  the delivery of services on the ground  you should use whatever works    churches  NGOs  local communities  whatever works. And in between  there should be a public agency  the Independent Service Authority  which channels public money  and especially donor money  to the retail providers. So the NGOs become part of a public government system  rather than independent of it. One advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently. Another is  you can make NGOs accountable. You can use yardstick competition  so they have to compete against each other for the resources. The good NGOs  like Oxfam  are very keen on this idea. They want to have the discipline and accountability. So that's a way to get basic services scaled up. And because the government would be funding it  it would be co branding these services. So they wouldn't be provided thanks to the United States government and some NGO. They would be co branded as being done by the post conflict government  in the country. So  jobs  basic services  finally  clean government. Clean means follow their money. The typical post conflict government is so short of money that it needs our money just to be on a life support system. You can't get the basic functions of the state done unless we put money into the core budget of these countries. But  if we put money into the core budget  we know that there aren't the budget systems with integrity that mean that money will be well spent. And if all we do is put money in and close our eyes it's not just that the money is wasted    that's the least of the problems    it's that the money is captured. It's captured by the crooks who are at the heart of the political problem. And so inadvertently we empower the people who are the problem. So building clean government means  yes  provide money to the budget  but also provide a lot of scrutiny  which means a lot of technical assistance that follows the money. Paddy Ashdown  who was the grand high nabob of Bosnia to the United Nations  in his book about his experience  he said   I realize what I needed was accountants without borders  to follow that money.  So that's the    let me wrap up  this is the package. What's the goal  If we follow this  what would we hope to achieve  That after    years  the focus on the construction sector would have produced both jobs and  hence  security    because young people would have jobs    and it would have reconstructed the infrastructure. So that's the focus on the construction sector. The focus on the basic service delivery through these independent service authorities would have rescued basic services from their catastrophic levels  and it would have given ordinary people the sense that the government was doing something useful. The emphasis on clean government would have gradually squeezed out the political crooks  because there wouldn't be any money in taking part in the politics. And so gradually the selection  the composition of politicians  would shift from the crooked to the honest. Where would that leave us  Gradually it would shift from a politics of plunder to a politics of hope. Thank you. I want to help you re perceive what philanthropy is  what it could be  and what your relationship to it is. And in doing that  I want to offer you a vision  an imagined future  if you will  of how  as the poet Seamus Heaney has put it   Once in a lifetime the longed for tidal wave of justice can rise up  and hope and history rhyme.  I want to start with these word pairs here. We all know which side of these we'd like to be on. When philanthropy was reinvented a century ago  when the foundation form was actually invented  they didn't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either. In fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways  as slow to respond to new challenges  as small and risk averse. And in fact they weren't. They were reinventing charity in those times  what Rockefeller called  the business of benevolence.  But by the end of the   th century  a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way. The thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about    and that's exactly what is happening    is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions  for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected  in service of the long term. This entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters. And it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders  like many of the people here  by new tools  like the ones we've seen here  and by new pressures. I've been following this change for quite a while now  and participating in it. This report is our main public report. What it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as     years ago. What I want to do is share some of the coolest things that are going on with you. And as I do that  I'm not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about    the Gates or the Soros or the Google. Instead  what I want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us  the democratization of philanthropy. This is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time. What I'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments  each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy. The first is mass collaboration  represented here by Wikipedia. Now  this may surprise you. But remember  philanthropy is about giving of time and talent  not just money. Clay Shirky  that great chronicler of everything networked  has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way. He said   We have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money. Now we have Wikipedia. Suddenly big things can be done for love.  Watch  this spring  for Paul Hawken's new book    Author and entrepreneur many of you may know about. The book is called  Blessed Unrest.  And when it comes out  a series of wiki sites under the label WISER  are going to launch at the same time. WISER stands for World Index for Social and Environmental Responsibility. WISER sets out to document  link and empower what Paul calls the largest movement  and fastest growing movement in human history  humanity's collective immune response to today's threats. Now  all of these big things for love    experiments    aren't going to take off. But the ones that do are going to be the biggest  the most open  the fastest  the most connected form of philanthropy in human history. Second category is online philanthropy marketplaces. This is  of course  to philanthropy what eBay and Amazon are to commerce. Think of it as peer to peer philanthropy. And this challenges yet another assumption  which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy. Take a look  if you haven't  at DonorsChoose. Omidyar Network has made a big investment in DonorsChoose. It's one of the best known of these new marketplaces where a donor can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need. Take a look at Changing the Present  started by a TEDster  next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present. GiveIndia is for a whole country. And it goes on and on. The third category is represented by Warren Buffet  which I call aggregated giving. It's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer. It's that he challenged another assumption  that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation. There are now  today  so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing  bringing together people around a common goal  to think bigger. One of the best known is Acumen Fund  led by Jacqueline Novogratz  a TEDster who got a big boost here at TED. But there are many others  New Profit in Cambridge  New School's Venture Fund in Silicon Valley  Venture Philanthropy Partners in Washington  Global Fund for Women in San Francisco. Take a look at these. These funds are to philanthropy what venture capital  private equity  and eventually mutual funds are to investing  but with a twist    because often a community forms around these funds  as it has at Acumen and other places. Now  imagine for a second these first three types of experiments  mass collaboration  online marketplaces  aggregated giving. And understand how they help us re perceive what organized philanthropy is. It's not about foundations necessarily  it's about the rest of us. And imagine the mash up  if you will  of these things  in the future  when these things come together in the experiments of the future    imagine that somebody puts up  say      million dollars for an inspiring goal    there were    gifts of     million dollars or more in the US last year  not out of the question    but only puts it up if it's matched by millions of small gifts from around the globe  thereby engaging lots of people  and building visibility and engaging people in the goal that's stated. I'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories  which are innovation  competitions and social investing. They're betting a visible competition  a prize  can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues  and thereby speed the solution. This tackles yet another assumption  that the giver and the organization is at the center  as opposed to putting the problem at the center. You can look to these innovators to help us especially with things that require technological or scientific solution. That leaves the final category  social investing  which is really  anyway  the biggest of them all  represented here by Xigi.net. And this  of course  tackles the biggest assumption of all  that business is business  and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world. Xigi is a new community site that's built by the community  linking and mapping this new social capital market. It lists already       entities that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise. So we can look to these innovators to help us remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that seeks a return  the good that can be driven could be astonishing. Now  what's really interesting here is that we're not thinking our way into a new way of acting  we're acting our way into a new way of thinking. Philanthropy is reorganizing itself before our very eyes. And even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers don't yet fulfill this aspiration  I think this is the new zeitgeist  open  big  fast  connected  and  let us also hope  long. We have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things. If we don't develop the stamina to stick with things    whatever it is you pick  stick with it    all of this stuff is just going to be  you know  a fad. But I'm really hopeful. And I'm hopeful because it's not only philanthropy that's reorganizing itself  it's also whole other portions of the social sector  and of business  that are busy challenging  business as usual.  And everywhere I go  including here at TED  I feel that there is a new moral hunger that is growing. What we're seeing is people really wrestling to describe what is this new thing that's happening. Words like  philanthrocapitalism   and  natural capitalism   and  philanthroentrepreneur   and  venture philanthropy.  We don't have a language for it yet. Whatever we call it  it's new  it's beginning  and I think it's gong to quite significant. And that's where my imagined future comes in  which I am going to call the social singularity. Many of you will realize that I'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer Vernor Vinge's notion of a technological singularity  where a number of trends accelerate and converge and come together to create  really  a shockingly new reality. It may be that the social singularity ahead is the one that we fear the most  a convergence of catastrophes  of environmental degradation  of weapons of mass destruction  of pandemics  of poverty. That's because our ability to confront the problems that we face has not kept pace with our ability to create them. And as we've heard here  it is no exaggeration to say that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands as never before. The question is  is there a positive social singularity  Is there a frontier for us of how we live together  Our future doesn't have to be imagined. We can create a future where hope and history rhyme. But we have a problem. Our experience to date  both individually and collectively  hasn't prepared us for what we're going to need to do  or who we're going to need to be. We are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible. That's why I have one last thing I want to show you. This is a photograph taken about     years ago of my grandfather and great grandfather. This is a newspaper publisher and a banker. And they were great community leaders. And  yes  they were great philanthropists. I keep this photograph close by to me    it's in my office    because I've always felt a mystical connection to these two men  both of whom I never knew. And so  in their honor  I want to offer you this blank slide. And I want you to imagine that this a photograph of you. And I want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating. Whatever that means to you. And I want you to imagine that it's     years from now  and your grandchild  or great grandchild  or niece or nephew or god child  is looking at this photograph of you. What is the story you most want for them to tell  Thank you very much. A month ago today I stood there     degrees south  the top of the bottom of the world  the Geographic South Pole. And I stood there beside two very good friends of mine  Richard Weber and Kevin Vallely. Together we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the South Pole. It took us    days     hours and    minutes to get there. We shaved five days off the previous best time. And in the process  I became the first person in history to make the entire     mile journey  from Hercules Inlet to South Pole  solely on feet  without skis. Now  many of you are probably saying   Wait a sec  is this tough to do   Imagine  if you will  dragging a sled  as you just saw in that video clip  with     pounds of gear  in it everything you need to survive on your Antarctic trek. It's going to be    below  every single day. You'll be in a massive headwind. And at some point you're going to have to cross these cracks in the ice  these crevasses. Some of them have a very precarious thin footbridge underneath them that could give way at a moment's notice  taking your sled  you  into the abyss  never to be seen again. The punchline to your journey  Look at the horizon. Yes  it's uphill the entire way  because the South Pole is at        feet  and you're starting at sea level. Our journey did not  in fact  begin at Hercules Inlet  where frozen ocean meets the land of Antarctica. It began a little less than two years ago. A couple of buddies of mine and I had finished a     day run across the entire Sahara desert. And while we were there we learned the seriousness of the water crisis in Northern Africa. We also learned that many of the issues facing the people of Northern Africa affected young people the most. I came home to my wife after     days of running in the sand  and I said   You know  there's no doubt if this bozo can get across the desert  we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to.  But if I'm going to continue doing these adventures  there has to be a reason for me to do them beyond just getting there. Around that time I met an extraordinary human being  Peter Thum  who inspired me with his actions. He's trying to find and solve water issues  the crisis around the world. His dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition  a run to the South Pole where  with an interactive website  I will be able to bring young people  students and teachers from around the world on board the expedition with me  as active members. So we would have a live website  that every single day of the    days  we would be blogging  telling stories of  you know  depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces  or we will burn. Crossing miles and miles of sastrugi    frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip deep. I'm telling you  crossing these things with     pound sled  that sled may as well have weighed       pounds  because that's what it felt like. We were blogging to this live website daily to these students that were tracking us as well  about    hour trekking days     hour trekking days  sometimes    hours of trekking daily to meet our goal. We'd catch cat naps at    below on our sled  incidentally. In turn  students  people from around the world  would ask us questions. Young people would ask the most amazing questions. One of my favorite  It's    below  you've got to go to the bathroom  where are you going to go and how are you going to do it  I'm not going to answer that. But I will answer some of the more popular questions. Where do you sleep  We slept in a tent that was very low to the ground  because the winds on Antarctica were so extreme  it would blow anything else away. What do you eat  One of my favorite dishes on expedition  butter and bacon. It's about a million calories. We were burning about       a day  so we needed it. How many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have  Virtually none. All of our equipment  including film equipment  was charged by the sun. And do you get along  I certainly hope so  because at some point or another on this expedition  one of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle  and put it in an infected blister  and drain it for you. But seriously  seriously  we did get along  because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people. They were our teammates  They were inspiring us. The stories we were hearing got us to the South Pole. The website worked brilliantly as a two way street of communication. Young people in northern Canada  kids in an elementary school  dragging sleds across the school yard  pretending they were Richard  Ray and Kevin. Amazing. We arrived at the South Pole. We huddled into that tent     below that day  I'll never forget it. We looked at each other with these looks of disbelief at what we had just completed. And I remember looking at the guys thinking   What do I take from this journey   You know  Seriously. That I'm this uber endurance guy  As I stand here today talking to you guys  I've been running for the grand sum of five years. And a year before that I was a pack a day smoker  living a very sedentary lifestyle. What I take from this journey  from my journeys  is that  in fact  within every fiber of my belief standing here  I know that we can make the impossible possible. I'm learning this at   . Can you imagine  Seriously  can you imagine  I'm learning this at    years of age. Imagine being    years old  hearing those words  and believing it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Now  if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics  then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country. And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive. The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra. And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject. And at top of that pyramid  it's calculus. And I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ... that the correct summit    that all of our students  every high school graduate should know    should be statistics  probability and statistics. I mean  don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject. It's one of the great products of the human mind. The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus. And every student who studies math  science  engineering  economics  they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college. But I'm here to say  as a professor of mathematics  that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious  meaningful way  in their day to day lives. On the other hand  statistics    that's a subject that you could  and should  use on daily basis. Right  It's risk. It's reward. It's randomness. It's understanding data. I think if our students  if our high school students    if all of the American citizens    knew about probability and statistics  we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today.  Laughter   Applause  Not only    thank you    not only that ... but if it's taught properly  it can be a lot of fun. I mean  probability and statistics  it's the mathematics of games and gambling. It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future. Look  the world has changed from analog to digital. And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital  from the more classical  continuous mathematics  to the more modern  discrete mathematics    the mathematics of uncertainty  of randomness  of data    that being probability and statistics. In summary  instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus  I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means. And I mean it. Thank you very much. This is the exact moment that I started creating something called Tinkering School. Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects  and be trusted. Trusted not to hurt themselves  and trusted not to hurt others. Tinkering School doesn't follow a set curriculum  and there are no tests. We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing. When the kids arrive they're confronted with lots of stuff  wood and nails and rope and wheels  and lots of tools  real tools. It's a six day immersive experience for the kids. And within that context  we can offer the kids time    something that seems in short supply in their over scheduled lives. Our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived  and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around. Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever. And the kids soon learn that all projects go awry    and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success  or gleeful calamity. We start from doodles and sketches. And sometimes we make real plans. And sometimes we just start building. Building is at the heart of the experience  hands on  deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand. Robin and I  acting as collaborators  keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion. Success is in the doing  and failures are celebrated and analyzed. Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear. When faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities  a really interesting behavior emerges  decoration. Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation. From these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before. All materials are available for use. Even those mundane  hateful  plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined. And the things that they build amaze even themselves. Video  Three  two  one  go  Gever Tulley  A rollercoaster built by seven year olds. Video  Yay  GT  Thank you. It's been a great pleasure. I'll start with my favorite muse  Emily Dickinson  who said that wonder is not knowledge  neither is it ignorance. It's something which is suspended between what we believe we can be  and a tradition we may have forgotten. And I think  when I listen to these incredible people here  I've been so inspired    so many incredible ideas  so many visions. And yet  when I look at the environment outside  you see how resistant architecture is to change. You see how resistant it is to those very ideas. We can think them out. We can create incredible things. And yet  at the end  it's so hard to change a wall. We applaud the well mannered box. But to create a space that never existed is what interests me  to create something that has never been  a space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits. And I think that's really what architecture is based on. Architecture is not based on concrete and steel and the elements of the soil. It's based on wonder. And that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities  the greatest spaces that we have had. And I think that is indeed what architecture is. It is a story. By the way  it is a story that is told through its hard materials. But it is a story of effort and struggle against improbabilities. If you think of the great buildings  of the cathedrals  of the temples  of the pyramids  of pagodas  of cities in India and beyond  you think of how incredible this is that that was realized not by some abstract idea  but by people. So  anything that has been made can be unmade. Anything that has been made can be made better. There it is  the things that I really believe are of important architecture. These are the dimensions that I like to work with. It's something very personal. It's not  perhaps  the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners. But I think these are the necessary oxygen for us to live in buildings  to live in cities  to connect ourselves in a social space. And I therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward. It's the only profession where you have to believe in the future. You can be a general  a politician  an economist who is depressed  a musician in a minor key  a painter in dark colors. But architecture is that complete ecstasy that the future can be better. And it is that belief that I think drives society. And today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us. And yet it is in times like this that I think architecture can thrive with big ideas  ideas that are not small. Think of the great cities. Think of the Empire State Building  the Rockefeller Center. They were built in times that were not really the best of times in a certain way. And yet that energy and power of architecture has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy. So again  I am a believer in the expressive. I have never been a fan of the neutral. I don't like neutrality in life  in anything. I think expression. And it's like espresso coffee  you know  you take the essence of the coffee. That's what expression is. It's been missing in much of the architecture  because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered  the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion  that has no value. And yet  I believe it is the expression    expression of the city  expression of our own space    that gives meaning to architecture. And  of course  expressive spaces are not mute. Expressive spaces are not spaces that simply confirm what we already know. Expressive spaces may disturb us. And I think that's also part of life. Life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile  but to reach out across the abyss of history  to places we have never been  and would have perhaps been  had we not been so lucky. So again  radical versus conservative. Radical  what does it mean  It's something which is rooted  and something which is rooted deep in a tradition. And I think that is what architecture is  it's radical. It's not just a conservation in formaldehyde of dead forms. It is actually a living connection to the cosmic event that we are part of  and a story that is certainly ongoing. It's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending. It's actually a story in which our acts themselves are pushing the story in a particular way. So again I am a believer in the radical architecture. You know the Soviet architecture of that building is the conservation. It's like the old Las Vegas used to be. It's about conserving emotions  conserving the traditions that have obstructed the mind in moving forward and of course what is radical is to confront them. And I think our architecture is a confrontation with our own senses. Therefore I believe it should not be cool. There is a lot of appreciation for the kind of cool architecture. I've always been an opponent of it. I think emotion is needed. Life without emotion would really not be life. Even the mind is emotional. There is no reason which does not take a position in the ethical sphere  in the philosophical mystery of what we are. So I think emotion is a dimension that is important to introduce into city space  into city life. And of course  we are all about the struggle of emotions. And I think that is what makes the world a wondrous place. And of course  the confrontation of the cool  the unemotional with emotion  is a conversation that I think cities themselves have fostered. I think that is the progress of cities. It's not only the forms of cities  but the fact that they incarnate emotions  not just of those who build them  but of those who live there as well. Inexplicable versus understood. You know  too often we want to understand everything. But architecture is not the language of words. It's a language. But it is not a language that can be reduced to a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write. Too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal tell you a story  but the story is very short  which says   We have no story to tell you.  So the important thing actually  is to introduce the actual architectural dimensions  which might be totally inexplicable in words  because they operate in proportions  in materials  in light. They connect themselves into various sources  into a kind of complex vector matrix that isn't really frontal but is really embedded in the lives  and in the history of a city  and of a people. So again  the notion that a building should just be explicit I think is a false notion  which has reduced architecture into banality. Hand versus the computer. Of course  what would we be without computers  Our whole practice depends on computing. But the computer should not just be the glove of the hand  the hand should really be the driver of the computing power. Because I believe that the hand in all its primitive  in all its physiological obscurity  has a source  though the source is unknown  though we don't have to be mystical about it. We realize that the hand has been given us by forces that are beyond our own autonomy. And I think when I draw drawings which may imitate the computer  but are not computer drawings    drawings that can come from sources that are completely not known  not normal  not seen  yet the hand    and that's what I really  to all of you who are working    how can we make the computer respond to our hand rather than the hand responding to the computer. I think that's part of what the complexity of architecture is. Because certainly we have gotten used to the propaganda that the simple is the good. But I don't believe it. Listening to all of you  the complexity of thought  the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming. And I think we shouldn't shy away in architecture  You know  brain surgery  atomic theory  genetics  economics are complex complex fields. There is no reason that architecture should shy away and present this illusory world of the simple. It is complex. Space is complex. Space is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds. And as wondrous as it is  it cannot be reduced to a kind of simplification that we have often come to be admired. And yet  our lives are complex. Our emotions are complex. Our intellectual desires are complex. So I do believe that architecture as I see it needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have  in every intimacy that we possess. Of course that means that architecture is political. The political is not an enemy of architecture. The politeama is the city. It's all of us together. And I've always believed that the act of architecture  even a private house  when somebody else will see it  is a political act  because it will be visible to others. And we live in a world which is connecting us more and more. So again  the evasion of that sphere  which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture  the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object has never appealed to me. And I do believe that this interaction with the history  with history that is often very difficult  to grapple with it  to create a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique. Because architecture is also the asking of questions. It's not only the giving of answers. It's also  just like life  the asking of questions. Therefore it is important that it be real. You know we can simulate almost anything. But the one thing that can be ever simulated is the human heart  the human soul. And architecture is so closely intertwined with it because we are born somewhere and we die somewhere. So the reality of architecture is visceral. It's not intellectual. It's not something that comes to us from books and theories. It's the real that we touch    the door  the window  the threshold  the bed    such prosaic objects. And yet  I try  in every building  to take that virtual world  which is so enigmatic and so rich  and create something in the real world. Create a space for an office  a space of sustainability that really works between that virtuality and yet can be realized as something real. Unexpected versus habitual. What is a habit  It's just a shackle for ourselves. It's a self induced poison. So the unexpected is always unexpected. You know  it's true  the cathedrals  as unexpected  will always be unexpected. You know Frank Gehry's buildings  they will continue to be unexpected in the future. So not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability  but an architecture that is full of tension  an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart  and that breaks out of the shackles of habits. And of course habits are enforced by architecture. When we see the same kind of architecture we become immured in that world of those angles  of those lights  of those materials. We think the world really looks like our buildings. And yet our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wonders that have been part of them. So again  the unexpected which is also the raw. And I often think of the raw and the refined. What is raw  The raw  I would say is the naked experience  untouched by luxury  untouched by expensive materials  untouched by the kind of refinement that we associate with high culture. So the rawness  I think  in space  the fact that sustainability can actually  in the future translate into a raw space  a space that isn't decorated  a space that is not mannered in any source  but a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature  might be refractive to our desires. A space that doesn't always follow us like a dog that has been trained to follow us  but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating other possibilities  other experiences  that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture. And of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to me because it creates a kind of a spark of new energy. And so I do like something which is pointed  not blunt  something which is focused on reality  something that has the power  through its leverage  to transform even a very small space. So architecture maybe is not so big  like science  but through its focal point it can leverage in an Archimedian way what we think the world is really about. And often it takes just a building to change our experience of what could be done  what has been done  how the world has remained both in between stability and instability. And of course buildings have their shapes. Those shapes are difficult to change. And yet  I do believe that in every social space  in every public space  there is a desire to communicate more than just that blunt thought  that blunt technique  but something that pinpoints  and can point in various directions forward  backward  sideways and around. So that is indeed what is memory. So I believe that my main interest is to memory. Without memory we would be amnesiacs. We would not know which way we were going  and why we are going where we're going. So I've been never interested in the forgettable reuse  rehashing of the same things over and over again  which  of course  get accolades of critics. Critics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way. But I rather play something completely unheard of  and even with flaws  than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed by its meaninglessness. So again  memory is the city  memory is the world. Without the memory there would be no story to tell. There would be nowhere to turn. The memorable  I think  is really our world  what we think the world is. And it's not only our memory  but those who remember us  which means that architecture is not mute. It's an art of communication. It tells a story. The story can reach into obscure desires. It can reach into sources that are not explicitly available. It can reach into millennia that have been buried  and return them in a just and unexpected equity. So again  I think the notion that the best architecture is silent has never appealed to me. Silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city. Cities should be full of vibrations  full of sound  full of music. And that indeed is the architectural mission that I believe is important  is to create spaces that are vibrant  that are pluralistic  that can transform the most prosaic activities  and raise them to a completely different expectation. Create a shopping center  a swimming place that is more like a museum than like entertainment. And these are our dreams. And of course risk. I think architecture should be risky. You know it costs a lot of money and so on  but yes  it should not play it safe. It should not play it safe  because if it plays it safe it's not moving us in a direction that we want to be. And I think  of course  risk is what underlies the world. World without risk would not be worth living. So yes  I do believe that the risk we take in every building. Risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent. Risks of spaces that have never been so dizzying  as they should be  for a pioneering city. Risks that really move architecture even with all its flaws  into a space which is much better that the ever again repeated hollowness of a ready made thing. And of course that is finally what I believe architecture to be. It's about space. It's not about fashion. It's not about decoration. It's about creating with minimal means something which can not be repeated  cannot be simulated in any other sphere. And there of course is the space that we need to breathe  is the space we need to dream. These are the spaces that are not just luxurious spaces for some of us  but are important for everybody in this world. So again  it's not about the changing fashions  changing theories. It's about carving out a space for trees. It's carving out a space where nature can enter the domestic world of a city. A space where something which has never seen a light of day can enter into the inner workings of a density. And I think that is really the nature of architecture. Now I am a believer in democracy. I don't like beautiful buildings built for totalitarian regimes. Where people cannot speak  cannot vote  cannot do anything. We too often admire those buildings. We think they are beautiful. And yet when I think of the poverty of society which doesn't give freedom to its people  I don't admire those buildings. So democracy  as difficult as it is  I believe in it. And of course  at Ground Zero what else  It's such a complex project. It's emotional. There is so many interests. It's political. There is so many parties to this project. There is so many interests. There's money. There's political power. There are emotions of the victims. And yet  in all its messiness  in all its difficulties  I would not have liked somebody to say   This is the tabula rasa  mister architect    do whatever you want.  I think nothing good will come out of that. I think architecture is about consensus. And it is about the dirty word  compromise.  Compromise is not bad. Compromise  if it's artistic  if it is able to cope with its strategies    and there is my first sketch and the last rendering    it's not that far away. And yet  compromise  consensus  that is what I believe in. And Ground Zero  despite all its difficulties  it's moving forward. It's difficult.           . Freedom Tower  the memorial. And that is where I end. I was inspired when I came here as an immigrant on a ship like millions of others  looking at America from that point of view. This is America. This is liberty. This is what we dream about. Its individuality  demonstrated in the skyline. It's resilience. And finally  it's the freedom that America represents  not just to me  as an immigrant  but to everyone in the world. Thank you. Chris Anderson  I've got a question. So have you come to peace with the process that happened at Ground Zero and the loss of the original  incredible design that you came up with  Daniel Libeskind  Look. We have to cure ourselves of the notion that we are authoritarian  that we can determine everything that happens. We have to rely on others  and shape the process in the best way possible. I came from the Bronx. I was taught not to be a loser  not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight. You have to fight for what you believe. You don't always win everything you want to win. But you can steer the process. And I believe that what will be built at Ground Zero will be meaningful  will be inspiring  will tell other generations of the sacrifices  of the meaning of this event. Not just for New York  but for the world. Chris Anderson  Thank you so much  Daniel Libeskind. Charles and Ray were a team. They were husband and wife. Despite the New York Times' and Vanity Fair's best efforts recently  they're not brothers.  Laughter  And they were a lot of fun. You know  Ray was the one who wore the ampersands in the family. We are going to focus on Charles today  because it is Charles'    th birthday. But when I speak of him  I'm really speaking of both of them as a team. Here's Charles when he was three. So he would be     this June. We have a lot of cool celebrations that we're going to do. The thing about their work is that most people come to the door of furniture    I suspect you probably recognize this chair and some of the others I'm going to show you. But we're going to first enter through the door of the Big Top. The whole thing about this  though  is that  you know  why am I showing it  Is it because Charles and Ray made this film  This is actually a training film for a clown college that they had. They also practiced a clown act when the future of furniture was not nearly as auspicious as it turned out to be. There is a picture of Charles. So let's watch the next clip. The film that we're about to see is a film they made for the Moscow World's Fair. Video  This is the land. It has many contrasts. It is rough and it is flat. In places it is cold. In some it is hot. Too much rain falls on some areas  and not enough on others. But people live on this land. And  as in Russia  they are drawn together into towns and cities. Here is something of the way they live. Eames Demetrios  Now  this is a film that was hardly ever seen in the United States. It was on seven screens and it was     feet across. And it was at the height of the Cold War. The Nixon Khrushchev Kitchen Debate happened about    feet from where this was shown. And yet  how did it start  You know  commonality  the first line in Charles' narration was   The same stars that shine down on Russia shine down on the United States. From the sky  our cities look much the same.  It was that human connection that Charles and Ray always found in everything. And you can imagine  and the thing about it is  that they believed that the human mind could handle this number of images because the important thing was to get the gestalt of what the images were about. So that was just a little snip. But the thing about Charles and Ray is that they were always modeling stuff. They were always trying things out. I think one of the things I am passionate about  my grandparents work  I'm passionate about my work  but on top of all that I'm passionate about a holistic vision of design  where design is a life skill  not a professional skill. And you know  those of us with kids often want our kids to take music. I'm no exception. But it's not about them becoming Bono or Tracy Chapman. It's about getting that music thing going through their heads and their thinking. Design is the same way. Design has to become that same way. And this is a model that they did of that seven screen presentation. And Charles just checking it out there. So now we're going to go through that door of furniture. This is an unusual installation of airport seating. So what we're going to see is some of the icons of Eames furniture. And the thing about their furniture is that they said the role of the designer was essentially that of a good host  anticipating the needs of the guest. So those are cool images. But these are ones I think are really cool. These are all the prototypes. These are the mistakes  although I don't think mistakes is the right word in design. It's just the things you try out to kind of make it work better. And you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs. Some of them are kind of cool looking. It's like  Hey  why didn't they try that   It was that hands on iterative process which is so much like vernacular design and folk design in traditional cultures. And I think that's one of the commonalities between modernism and traditional design. I think it may be a real common ground as we kind of figure out what on earth to do in the next    or    years. The other thing that's kind of cool is that you look at this and in the media when people say design  they actually mean style. And I'm really here to talk about design. But you know the object is just a pivot. It's a pivot between a process and a system. And this is a little film I made about the making of the Eames lounge chair. The design process for Charles and Ray never ended in manufacturing. It continued. They were always trying to make thing better and better. Because it's like as Bill Clinton was saying about Rwandan health clinics. It's not enough to create one. You've got to create a system that will work better and better. So I've always liked this prototype picture. Because it just kind of  you know  doesn't get any more basic than that. You try things out. This is a relatively famous chair. Its early version had an  X  base. That's what the collectors like. Charles and Ray liked this one because it was better. It worked better   H  base  much more practical. This is something called a splint. And I was very touched by Dean Kamen's work for the military  or for the soldiers  because Charles and Ray designed a molded plywood splint. This is it. And they'd been working on furniture before. But doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process  which was incredibly important to them. I'm trying to show you too much  because I want you to really get a broth of ideas and images. This is a house that Charles and Ray designed. My sister is chasing someone else. It's not me. Although I endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary  it's not me. And then this is a film  on the lower left  that Charles and Ray made. Now look at that plastic chair. The house is     . The chair is done in     . Charles and Ray  they didn't obsess about style for it's own sake. They didn't say   Our style is curves. Let's make the house curvy.  They didn't say   Our style is grids. Let's make the chair griddy.  They focused on the need. They tried to solve the design problem. Charles used to say   The extent to which you have a design style is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem.  It's kind of a brutal quote. This is the earlier design of that house. And again  they managed to figure out a way to make a prototype of a house    architecture  very expensive medium. Here's a film we've been hearing things about. The  Powers of Ten  is a film they made. If we watch the next clip  you're going to see the first version of  Powers of Ten   upper left. The familiar one on the lower right. The Eames' film Tops  lower left. And a lamp that Charles designed for a church. Video  Which in turn belongs to a local group of galaxies. These form part of a grouping system much as the stars do. They are so many and so varied that from this distance they appear like the stars from Earth. ED  You've seen that film  and what's so great about this whole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale. Everybody here is coming at it from a different way. I want to give you one example. E.O. Wilson once told me that when he looked at ants    he loved them  of course  and he wanted to learn more about them    he consciously looked at them from the standpoint of scale. So here is the tiny creature. And yet simply by changing the frame of reference it reveals so much  including what ended up being the TED Prize. Modeling  they tried modeling all the time. They were always modeling things. And I think part of that is that they never delegated understanding. And I think in our family we were very lucky  because we learned about design backwards. Design was not something other. It was part of the business of life in general. It was part of the quality of life. And here is some family pictures. And you can see why I'm down on style  with a haircut like that. But anyway   Laughter  I remember the cut grapefruit that we would have at the Eames house when I was a kid. So we're going to watch another film. This is a film  the one called Toys. You can see me  I have the same haircut  in the upper right corner. Upper left is a film they did on toy trains. Lower right is a solar do nothing toy. Lower left is Day of the Dead toys. Charles used to say that toys are not as innocent as they appear. They are often the precursor to bigger things. And these ideas    that train up there  being about the honest use of materials  is totally the same as the honest use of materials in the plywood. And now I'm going to test you. This is a letter that my grandfather sent to my mom when she was five years old. So can you read it  Lucia angel  okay  eye. Audience  Saw many trains. ED  Awl  also  good that the leather crafter's guild is here. Also  what is he doing  Row  rowed. Sun  No. Well is there another name for a sunrise  Dawn  very good. Also rode on one. I ... Audience  You had  I hope you had    ED  Now you've been to the website Dogs of Saint Louis in the late  in the mid     's  then you'd know that was a Great Dane. So  I hope you had a Audience  Nice time  time    ED  Time at. Citizen Kane  rose    Audience  Rosebud. ED  No  bud.  D 's right. At Buddy's    Audience  Party. Love. ED  Okay  good. So   I saw many trains and also rode on one. I hope you had a nice time at Buddy's party.  So you guys did pretty good  cool. So my mom and Charles had this great relationship where they'd send those sorts of things back and forth to one another. And it's all part of the  you know  they used to say   Take your pleasure seriously.  These are some images from a project of mine that's called Kymaerica. It's sort of an alternative universe. It's kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape. Those plaques are plaques we've been installing around North America. We're about to do six in the U.K. next week. And they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world. So  of course  since it's bronze it has to be true. Video  Kymaerica with waterfalls  tumbling through our    ED  This is one of the traditional Kymaerican songs. And so we had spelling bees in Paris  Illinois. Video  Your word is N. Carolina. Girl  Y I N D I A N A. ED  And then Embassy Row is actually a historical site  because in the Kymaerican story this is where the Parisian Diaspora started  where there embassy was. So you can actually visit and have this three dimensional fictional experience there. And the town has really embraced it. We had the spelling bee in conjunction with the Gwomeus Club. But what is really cool is that we take our visual environment as inevitable. And it's not. Other things could have happened. The Japanese could have discovered Monterey. And we could have been born         years ago. And there are a lot of fun things. This is the Museum of the Bench. They have trading cards and all sorts of cool things. And you're kind of trapped in the texture of Kymaerica. The Tahatchabe  the great road building culture. A guy named Nobu Naga  the so called Japanese Columbus. But now I'm going to return you to the real world. And this is Cranbrook. I've got a real treat for you  which is the first film that Charles ever made. So let's watch that. Nobody's ever seen it. Cranbrook is very generous to let us show it for the first time here. It's a film about Maya Gretel  a famous ceramicist  and a teacher at Cranbrook. And he made it for the      faculty exhibition. Silent. We don't have a track for it yet. Very simple. It's just a start. But it's that learn by doing thing. You want to learn how to make films  Go make a movie. And you try something out. But here is what's really great. See that chair there  The orange one  That's the organic chair.     . At the same time that Charles was doing that chair  he was doing this film. So my point is that this scope of vision  this holistic vision of design  was with them from the beginning. It wasn't like  Oh  we made some chairs and got successful. Now we're going to do some movies.  It was always part of how they looked at the world. And that's what's really powerful. And I think that all of us in this room  as you move design forward  it's not about just doing one thing. It's about how you approach problems. And there is this huge  beautiful commonality between design  business and the world. So we're going to do the last clip. And I've shown you some of the images. I just want to focus on sound now. So this is Charles' voice. Charles Eames  In India  those without  and the lowest in caste  eat very often  particularly in southern India  they eat off of a banana leaf. And those a little bit up the scale eat off of a sort of a low fired ceramic dish. And a little bit higher  why they have a glaze on a thing they call a thali. If you're up the scale a little bit more  why  a brass thali. And then things get to be a little questionable. There are things like silver plated thalis. And there is solid silver thalis. And I suppose some nut has had a gold thali that he's eaten off of. But you can go beyond that. And the guys that have not only means  but a certain amount of knowledge and understanding  go to the next step  and they eat off a banana leaf. And I think that in these times when we fall back and regroup  that somehow or other  the banana leaf parable sort of got to get working there  because I'm not prepared to say that the banana leaf that one eats off of is the same as the other eats off of. But it is that process that has happened within the man that changes the banana leaf. ED  I've been looking forward to sharing that quote with you. Because that's part of where we've got to get to. And I also want to share this one.  Beyond the age of information is the age of choices.  And I really think that's where we are. And it's kind of cool for me to be part of a family and a tradition where he was talking about that in     . And part of why this stuff is important and all the things that we do are important  is that these are the ideas we need. And I think that this is all part of surrendering to the design journey. That's what we all need to do. Design is not just for designers anymore. It's a process. It's not style. All that great thinking needs to really get about solving pretty key problems. I really thank you for your time. Last year at TED we aimed to try to clarify the overwhelming complexity and richness that we experience at the conference in a project called Big Viz. And the Big Viz is a collection of     sketches that were made by two visual artists. David Sibbet from The Grove  and Kevin Richards  from Autodesk  made     sketches that strive to capture the essence of each presenter's ideas. And the consensus was  it really worked. These sketches brought to life the key ideas  the portraits  the magic moments that we all experienced last year. This year we were thinking   Why does it work   What is it about animation  graphics  illustrations  that create meaning  And this is an important question to ask and answer because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning  the better we can communicate  and  I also think  the better we can think and collaborate together. So this year we're going to visualize how the brain visualizes. Cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain doesn't actually see the world as it is  but instead  creates a series of mental models through a collection of  Ah ha moments   or moments of discovery  through various processes. The processing  of course  begins with the eyes. Light enters  hits the back of the retina  and is circulated  most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain  at the primary visual cortex. And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry  just the simplest of shapes. But it also acts like a kind of relay station that re radiates and redirects information to many other parts of the brain. As many as    other parts that selectively make more sense  create more meaning through the kind of  Ah ha  experiences. We're only going to talk about three of them. So the first one is called the ventral stream. It's on this side of the brain. And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is. It's the  what  detector. Look at a hand. Look at a remote control. Chair. Book. So that's the part of the brain that is activated when you give a word to something. A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream. And what it does is locates the object in physical body space. So if you look around the stage here you'll create a kind of mental map of the stage. And if you closed your eyes you'd be able to mentally navigate it. You'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that. The third part that I'd like to talk about is the limbic system. And this is deep inside of the brain. It's very old  evolutionarily. And it's the part that feels. It's the kind of gut center  where you see an image and you go   Oh  I have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever I'm seeing.  So the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways. So what can we learn about this  How can we apply this insight  Well  again  the schematic view is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at. The brain processes this in parallel  the figments of information asking a whole bunch of questions to create a unified mental model. So  for example  when you look at this image a good graphic invites the eye to dart around  to selectively create a visual logic. So the act of engaging  and looking at the image creates the meaning. It's the selective logic. Now we've augmented this and spatialized this information. Many of you may remember the magic wall that we built in conjunction with Perceptive Pixel where we quite literally create an infinite wall. And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas. So the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery enriches meaning. It activates a different part of the brain. And then the limbic system is activated when we see motion  when we see color  and there are primary shapes and pattern detectors that we've heard about before. So the point of this is what  We make meaning by seeing  by an act of visual interrogation. The lessons for us are three fold. First  use images to clarify what we're trying to communicate. Secondly make those images interactive so that we engage much more fully. And the third is to augment memory by creating a visual persistence. These are techniques that can be used to be    that can be applied in a wide range of problem solving. So the low tech version looks like this. And  by the way  this is the way in which we develop and formulate strategy within Autodesk  in some of our organizations and some of our divisions. What we literally do is have the teams draw out the entire strategic plan on one giant wall. And it's very powerful because everyone gets to see everything else. There's always a room  always a place to be able to make sense of all of the components in the strategic plan. This is a time lapse view of it. You can ask the question   Who's the boss   You'll be able to figure that out.  Laughter  So the act of collectively and collaboratively building the image transforms the collaboration. No Powerpoint is used in two days. But instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on. And this can be enhanced and augmented with some emerging digital technology. And this is our great unveiling for today. And this is an emerging set of technologies that use large screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible. Here what we can do is look at sustainability  quite literally. So a team can actually look at all the key components that heat the structure and make choices and then see the end result that is visualized on this screen. So making images meaningful has three components. The first again  is making ideas clear by visualizing them. Secondly  making them interactive. And then thirdly  making them persistent. And I believe that these three principles can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems that we face in the world today. Thanks so much. I normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war. But today I've got a personal story to share with you. This is a picture of my family  my four siblings    my mom and I    taken in     . And we're actually Cambodians. And this picture is taken in Vietnam. So how did a Cambodian family end up in Vietnam in       Well to explain that  I've got a short video clip to explain the Khmer Rouge regime during      and     . Video  April   th      . The communist Khmer Rouge enters Phnom Penh to liberate their people from the encroaching conflict in Vietnam  and American bombing campaigns. Led by peasant born Pol Pot  the Khmer Rouge evacuates people to the countryside in order to create a rural communist utopia  much like Mao Tse tung's Cultural Revolution in China. The Khmer Rouge closes the doors to the outside world. But after four years the grim truth seeps out. In a country of only seven million people  one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders  their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields. Sophal Ear  So  notwithstanding the     s narration  on April   th      we lived in Phnom Penh. And my parents were told by the Khmer Rouge to evacuate the city because of impending American bombing for three days. And here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge. They were young soldiers  typically child soldiers. And this is very normal now  of modern day conflict  because they're easy to bring into wars. The reason that they gave about American bombing wasn't all that far off. I mean  from      to      there were more munitions that fell on Cambodia than in all of World War II Japan  including the two nuclear bombs of August     . The Khmer Rouge didn't believe in money. So the equivalent of the Federal Reserve Bank in Cambodia was bombed. But not just that  they actually banned money. I think it's the only precedent in which money has ever been stopped from being used. And we know money is the root of all evil  but it didn't actually stop evil from happening in Cambodia  in fact. My family was moved from Phnom Penh to Pursat province. This is a picture of what Pursat looks like. It's actually a very pretty area of Cambodia  where rice growing takes place. And in fact they were forced to work the fields. So my father and mother ended up in a sort of concentration camp  labor camp. And it was at that time that my mother got word from the commune chief that the Vietnamese were actually asking for their citizens to go back to Vietnam. And she spoke some Vietnamese  as a child having grown up with Vietnamese friends. And she decided  despite the advice of her neighbors  that she would take the chance and claim to be Vietnamese so that we could have a chance to survive  because at this point they're forcing everybody to work. And they're giving about    in a modern day  caloric restriction diet  I guess    they're giving porridge  with a few grains of rice. And at about this time actually my father got very sick. And he didn't speak Vietnamese. So he died actually  in January     . And it made it possible  in fact  for us to take on this plan. So the Khmer Rouge took us from a place called Pursat to Kaoh Tiev  which is across from the border from Vietnam. And there they had a detention camp where alleged Vietnamese would be tested  language tested. And my mother's Vietnamese was so bad that to make our story more credible  she'd given all the boys and girls new Vietnamese names. But she'd given the boys girls' names  and the girls boys' names. And it wasn't until she met a Vietnamese lady who told her this  and then tutored her for two days intensively  that she was able to go into her exam and    you know  this was a moment of truth. If she fails  we're all headed to the gallows  if she passes  we can leave to Vietnam. And she actually  of course    I'm here  she passes. And we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side. And then onwards to Chau Doc. And this is a picture of Hong Ngu  Vietnam today. A pretty idyllic place on the Mekong Delta. But for us it meant freedom. And freedom from persecution from the Khmer Rouge. Last year  the Khmer Rouge Tribunal  which the U.N. is helping Cambodia take on  started  and I decided that as a matter of record I should file a Civil Complaint with the Tribunal about my father's passing away. And I got word last month that the complaint was officially accepted by the Khmer Rouge Tribunal. And it's for me a matter of justice for history  and accountability for the future  because Cambodia remains a pretty lawless place  at times. Five years ago my mother and I went back to Chau Doc. And she was able to return to a place that for her meant freedom  but also fear  because we had just come out of Cambodia. I'm happy  actually  today  to present her. She's here today with us in the audience. Thank you mother. So it was about four years ago  five years ago  I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia  I think it was  with a bag similar to this. And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag. And I was saying  you don't know this molecule really well  but your body knows it extremely well. And I was thinking that your body hated it  at the time  because we are very immune to this. This is called alpha gal epitope. And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily. Actually our body doesn't hate these. Our body loves these. It eats them. I mean  the cells in our immune system are always hungry. And if an antibody is stuck to one of these things on the cell  it means  that's food.  Now  I was thinking about that and I said  you know  we've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don't make  and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff. But I said we can't get rid of it  because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can't get rid of that immunity. And I said  why don't you use that  What if I could stick this molecule  slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me  that had just invaded my lungs  I mean I could immediately tap into an immune response that was already there  where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it    it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on. It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you  like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A.  and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car  and then charges you for possession of marijuana. It's like this very fast  very efficient way to get people off the street. So you can take a bacteria that really doesn't make these things at all  and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street. And for certain bacteria we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore. Our antibiotics are running out. And  I mean  the world apparently is running out too. So probably it doesn't matter    years from now    streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant    because we won't be here. But if we are    we're going to need something to do with the bacteria. So I started working with this thing  with a bunch of collaborators. And trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones  bacteria that we don't like. And I feel now like George Bush. It's like  mission accomplished.  So I might be doing something dumb  just like he was doing at the time. But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work. And it's killing bacteria. It's eating them. This thing can be stuck  like that little green triangle up there  sort of symbolizing this right now. You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer. And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it. So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like  like Staphylococcus    I don't like it in particular  because it killed a professor friend of mine last year. It doesn't respond to antibiotics. So I don't like it. And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it. That will know how to find Staph when it's in your body  and will alert your immune system to go after it. Here's what happened. See that line on the very top with the little dots  That's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in Texas  at Brooks Air Base  with anthrax. And they had also been treated with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular  and direct your immune system to it. You'll notice they all lived  the ones on the top line    that's a     percent survival rate. And they actually lived another    days  or    when we finally killed them  and took them apart and figured out what went wrong. Why did they not die  And they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore. So we did it. Okay  Mission accomplished  Because of what I'm about to say  I really should establish my green credentials. When I was a small boy  I took my pledge as an American  to save and faithfully defend from waste the natural resources of my country  its air  soil and minerals  its forests  waters and wildlife. And I've stuck to that. Stanford  I majored in ecology and evolution.       I put out the Whole Earth Catalog. Was  mister natural  for a while. And then worked for the Jerry Brown administration. The Brown administration  and a bunch of my friends  basically leveled the energy efficiency of California  so it's the same now     years later  even though our economy has gone up    percent  per capita. And we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state. California is basically the equivalent of Europe  in this. This year  Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I'll preview today  called Whole Earth Discipline. The dominant demographic event of our time is this screamingly rapid urbanization that we have going on. By mid century we'll be about    percent urban  and that's mostly in the developing world  where that's happening. It's interesting  because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities. The developing world now has all of the biggest cities  and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries  and nine times bigger. It's qualitatively different. They are the drivers of history  as we see by looking at history.       years ago this is what the world looked like. Well we now have a distribution of urban power similar to what we had       years ago. In other words  the rise of the West  dramatic as it was  is over. The aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming   .  million people a week coming to town  decade after decade. What's really going on  Well  what's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out. Subsistence farming is drying up basically. People are following opportunity into town. And this is why. I used to have a very romantic idea about villages  and it's because I never lived in one. Because in town    this is the bustling squatter city of Kibera  near Nairobi    they see action. They see opportunity. They see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in back in the subsistence farm. As you go around these places there's plenty of aesthetics. There is plenty going on. They are poor  but they are intensely urban. And they are intensely creative. The aggregate numbers now are that basically squatters  all one billion of them  are building the urban world  which means they're building the world    personally  one by one  family by family  clan by clan  neighborhood by neighborhood. They start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by. They even build their own infrastructure. Well  steal their own infrastructure  at first. Cable TV  water  the whole gamut  all gets stolen. And then gradually gentrifies. It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity  not the working slums  they help create prosperity. So in a town like Mumbai  which is half slums  it's    th of the GDP of India. Social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense. These people are valuable as a group. And that's how they work. There is a lot of people who think about all these poor people   Oh there's terrible things. We've got to fix their housing.  It used to be   Oh we've got to get them phone service.  Now they're showing us how they do their phone service. Famine mostly is a rural event now. There are things they care about. And this is where we can help. And the nations they're in can help. And they are helping each other solve these issues. And you go to a nice dense place like this slum in Mumbai. You look at that lane on the right. And you can ask   Okay what's going on there   The answer is   Everything.  This is better than a mall. It's much denser. It's much more interactive. And the scale is terrific. The main event is  these are not people crushed by poverty. These are people busy getting out of poverty just as fast as they can. They're helping each other do it. They're doing it through an outlaw thing  the informal economy. The informal economy  it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics  it's not supposed to be there  but it's huge. We don't understand how it works yet  but we have to. Furthermore  people in the informal economy  the gray economy    as time goes by  crime is happening around them. And they can join the criminal world  or they can join the legitimate world. We should be able to make that choice easier for them to get toward the legitimate world  because if we don't  they will go toward the criminal world. There's all kinds of activity. In Dharavi the slum performs not only a lot of services for itself  but it performs services for the city at large. And one of the main events are these ad hoc schools. Parents pool their money to hire some local teachers to a private  tiny  unofficial school. Education is more possible in the cities  and that changes the world. So you see some interesting  typical  urban things. So one thing slammed up against another  such as in Sao Paulo here. That's what cities do. That's how they create value  is by slamming things together. In this case  supply right next to demand. So the maids and the gardeners and the guards that live in this lively part of town on the left walk to work  in the boring  rich neighborhood. Proximity is amazing. We are learning about how dense proximity can be. Connectivity between the city and the country is what's going to keep the country good  because the city has interesting ways of doing things. This is what makes cities    this is what makes cities so green in the developing world. Because people leave the poverty trap  an ecological disaster of subsistence farms  and head to town. And when they're gone the natural environment starts to come back very rapidly. And those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops to send food to the new growing markets in town. So if you want to save a village  you do it with a good road  or with a good cell phone connection  and ideally some grid electrical power. So the event is  we're a city planet. That just happened. More than half. The numbers are considerable. A billion live in the squatter cities now. Another billion is expected. That's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way. And that will determine a lot of how we function. Now  for us environmentalists  maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb. People get into town. The immediately have fewer children. They don't even have to get rich yet. Just the opportunity of coming up in the world means they will have fewer  higher quality kids  and the birthrate goes down radically. Very interesting side effect here  here's a slide from Phillip Longman. Shows what is happening. As we have more and more old people  like me  and fewer and fewer babies. And they are regionally separated. What you're getting is a world which is old folks  and old cities  going around doing things the old way  in the north. And young people in brand new cities they're inventing  doing new things  in the south. Where do you think the action is going to be  Shift of subject. Quickly drop by climate. The climate news  I'm sorry to say  is going to keep getting worse than we think  faster than we think. Climate is a profoundly complex  nonlinear system  full of runaway positive feedbacks  hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points. Here's just a few samples. We're going to keep being surprised. And almost all the surprises are going to be bad ones. From your standpoint this means a great increase in climate refugees over the coming decades  and what goes along with that  which is resource wars and chaos wars  as we're seeing in Darfur. That's what drought does. It brings carrying capacity down  and there's not enough carrying capacity to support the people. And then you're in trouble. Shift to the power situation. Baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city  or a city planet. So far there is only three sources of baseload electricity  coal  some gas  nuclear and hydro. Of those  only nuclear and hydro are green. Coal is what is causing the climate problems. And everyone will keep burning it because it's so cheap  until governments make it expensive. Wind and solar can't help  because so far we don't have a way to store that energy. So with hydro maxed out  coal and lose the climate  or nuclear  which is the current operating low carbon source  and maybe save the climate. And if we can eventually get good solar in space  that also could help. Because remember  this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world in the villages and in the cities. So  between coal and nuclear  compare their waste products. If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear  the amount of waste that would be added up would fit in a Coke can. Whereas a coal burning plant  a normal one gigawatt coal plant  burns    rail cars of coal a day  each car having     tons. And it puts    thousand tons of carbon dioxide in the air. So and then when you compare the lifetime emissions of these various energy forms  nuclear is about even with solar and wind  and ahead of solar    oh  I'm sorry    with hydro and wind  and ahead of solar. And does nuclear really compete with coal  Just ask the coal miners in Australia. That's where you see some of the source  not from my fellow environmentalists  but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power. Well the good news is that the developing world  but frankly  the whole world  is busy building  and starting to build  nuclear reactors. This is good for the atmosphere. It's good for their prosperity. I want to point out one interesting thing  which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower. It's supposed to be  I don't know  local solar and wind and cogeneration  and good things like that. But frankly micro reactors which are just now coming on  might serve even better. The Russians  who started this  are building floating reactors  for their new passage  where the ice is melting  north of Russia. And they're selling these floating reactors  only    megawatts  to developing countries. Here's the design of an early one from Toshiba. It's interesting  say  to take a    megawatt     million watts  and you compare it to the standard big iron of an ordinary Westinghouse or Ariva  which is  .    .  billion watts. These things are way smaller. They're much more adaptable. Here's an American design from Lawrence Livermore Lab. Here's another American design that came out of Los Alamos  and is now commercial. Almost all of these are not only small  they are proliferation proof. They're typically buried in the ground. And the innovation is moving very rapidly. So I think microreactors is going to be important for the future. In terms of proliferation  nuclear energy has done more to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity. And that's why    percent of the electricity in this room     percent of electricity in this room is probably nuclear. Half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia  soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads. And so I would like to see the GNEP program  that was developed in the Bush administration  go forward aggressively. And I was glad to see that president Obama supported the nuclear fuel bank strategy when he spoke in Prague the other week. One more subject. Genetically engineered food crops  in my view  as a biologist  have no reason to be controversial. My fellow environmentalists  on this subject  have been irrational  anti scientific  and very harmful. Despite their best efforts  genetically engineered crops are the most rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history. They're good for the environment because they enable no till farming  which leaves the soil in place  getting healthier from year to year    slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil into the atmosphere. They reduce pesticide use. And they increase yield  which allows you to have your agricultural area be smaller  and therefore more wild area is freed up. By the way  this map from      is out of date because it shows Africa still under the thumb of Greenpeace  and Friends of the Earth from Europe  and they're finally getting out from under that. And biotech is moving rapidly in Africa  at last. This is a moral issue. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics met on this issue twice in great detail and said it is a moral imperative to make genetically engineered crops readily available. Speaking of imperatives  geoengineering is taboo now  especially in government circles  though I think there was a DARPA meeting on it a couple of weeks ago  but it will be on your plate    not this year but pretty soon  because some harsh realizations are coming along. This is a list of them. Basically the news is going to keep getting more scary. There will be events  like        people dying of a heat wave  which happened a while back. Like cyclones coming up toward Bangladesh. Like wars over water  such as in the Indus. And as those events keep happening we're going to say   Okay  what can we do about that really   But there's this little problem with geoengineering  what body is going to decide who gets to engineer  How much they do  Where they do it  Because everybody is downstream  downwind of whatever is done. And if we just taboo it completely we could lose civilization. But if we just say  OK  China  you're worried  you go ahead. You geoengineer your way. We'll geoengineer our way.  That would be considered an act of war by both nations. So this is very interesting diplomacy coming along. I should say  it is more practical than people think. Here is an example that climatologists like a lot  one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas. This one came from the sulfur dioxide from Mount Pinatubo in         cooled the earth by half a degree. There was so much ice in       the following year  that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs who were known as the Pinatubo cubs. To put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year. That's nothing  compared to all of the other things we may be trying to do about energy. Just to run by another one  this is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds  by atomizing seawater  that would brighten the albedo of the whole planet. A nice one  because it can happen lots of little ways in lots of little places  is by copying the ancient Amazon Indians who made good agricultural soil by pyrolizing  smoldering  plant waste  and biochar fixes large quantities of carbon while it's improving the soil. So here is where we are. Nobel Prize winning climatologist Paul Crutzen calls our geological era the Anthropocene  the human dominated era. We are stuck with its obligations. In the Whole Earth Catalog  my first words were   We are as Gods  and might as well get good at it.  The first words of Whole Earth Discipline are   We are as Gods  and have to get good at it.  Thank you. I have a studio in Berlin    let me cue on here    which is down there in this snow  just last weekend. In the studio we do a lot of experiments. I would consider the studio more like a laboratory. I have occasional meetings with scientists. And I have an academy  a part of the University of Fine Arts in Berlin. We have an annual gathering of people  and that is called Life in Space. Life in Space is really not necessarily about how we do things  but why we do things. Do you mind looking  with me  at that little cross in the center there  So just keep looking. Don't mind me. So you will have a yellow circle  and we will do an after image experiment. When the circle goes away you will have another color  the complementary color. I am saying something. And your eyes and your brain are saying something back. This whole idea of sharing  the idea of constituting reality by overlapping what I say and what you say    think of a movie. Since two years now  with some stipends from the science ministry in Berlin  I've been working on these films where we produce the film together. I don't necessarily think the film is so interesting. Obviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative. But nevertheless  what the potential is    and just keep looking there    what the potential is  obviously  is to kind of move the border of who is the author  and who is the receiver. Who is the consumer  if you want  and who has responsibility for what one sees  I think there is a socializing dimension in  kind of  moving that border. Who decides what reality is  This is the Tate Modern in London. The show was  in a sense  about that. It was about a space in which I put half a semi circular yellow disk. I also put a mirror in the ceiling  and some fog  some haze. And my idea was to make the space tangible. With such a big space  the problem is obviously that there is a discrepancy between what your body can embrace  and what the space  in that sense  is. So here I had the hope that by inserting some natural elements  if you want    some fog    I could make the space tangible. And what happens is that people  they start to see themselves in this space. So look at this. Look at the girl. Of course they have to look through a bloody camera in a museum. Right  That's how museums are working today. But look at her face there  as she's checking out  looking at herself in the mirror.  Oh  That was my foot there   She wasn't really sure whether she was seeing herself or not. And in that whole idea  how do we configure the relationship between our body and the space  How do we reconfigure it  How do we know that being in a space makes a difference  Do you see when I said in the beginning  it's about why  rather than how  The why meant really   What consequences does it have when I take a step    What does it matter    Does it matter if I am in the world or not    And does it matter whether the kind of actions I take filter into a sense of responsibility   Is art about that  I would say yes. It is obviously about not just about decorating the world  and making it look even better  or even worse  if you ask me. It's obviously also about taking responsibility  like I did here when throwing some green dye in the river in L.A.  Stockholm  Norway and Tokyo  among other places. The green dye is not environmentally dangerous  but it obviously looks really rather frightening. And it's on the other side also  I think  quite beautiful  as it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas  in these different places of the world. The  Green river   as a kind of activist idea  not a part of an exhibition  it was really about showing people  in this city  as they walk by  that space has dimensions. A space has time. And the water flows through the city with time. The water has an ability to make the city negotiable  tangible. Negotiable meaning that it makes a difference whether you do something or not. It makes a difference whether you say   I'm a part of this city. And if I vote it makes a difference. If I take a stand  it makes a difference.  This whole idea of a city not being a picture is  I think  something that art  in a sense  always was working with. The idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship between what it means to be in a picture  and what it means to be in a space. What is the difference  The difference between thinking and doing. So these are different experiments with that. I won't go into them. Iceland  lower right corner  my favorite place. These kinds of experiments  they filter into architectural models. These are ongoing experiments. One is an experiment I did for BMW  an attempt to make a car. It's made out of ice. A crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top  which I am trying to turn into a concert hall in Iceland. A sort of a run track  or a walk track  on the top of a museum in Denmark  which is made of colored glass  going all around. So the movement with your legs will change the color of your horizon. And two summers ago at the Hyde Park in London  with the Serpentine Gallery  a kind of a temporal pavilion where moving was the only way you could see the pavilion. This summer  in New York  there is one thing about falling water which is very much about the time it takes for water to fall. It's quite simple and fundamental. I've walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland. And as you come to a new valley  as you come to a new landscape  you have a certain view. If you stand still  the landscape doesn't necessarily tell you how big it is. It doesn't really tell you what you're looking at. The moment you start to move  the mountain starts to move. The big mountains far away  they move less. The small mountains in the foreground  they move more. And if you stop again  you wonder   Is that a one hour valley  Or is that a three hour hike  or is that a whole day I'm looking at   If you have a waterfall in there  right out there at the horizon  you look at the waterfall and you go   Oh  the water is falling really slowly.  And you go   My god it's really far away and it's a giant waterfall.  If a waterfall is falling faster  it's a smaller waterfall which is closer by    because the speed of falling water is pretty constant everywhere. And your body somehow knows that. So this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space. Of course being an iconic city like New York  that has had an interest in somehow playing around with the sense of space  you could say that New York wants to seem as big as possible. Adding a measurement to that is interesting  the falling water suddenly gives you a sense of   Oh  Brooklyn is exactly this much    the distance between Brooklyn and Manhattan  in this case the lower East River is this big.  So it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities. It was also about giving the city a sense of dimension. And why would we want to do that  Because I think it makes a difference whether you have a body that feels a part of a space  rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture. And  Ha ha  there is a picture and here is I. And what does it matter   Is there a sense of consequences  So if I have a sense of the space  if I feel that the space is tangible  if I feel there is time  if there is a dimension I could call time  I also feel that I can change the space. And suddenly it makes a difference in terms of making space accessible. One could say this is about community  collectivity. It's about being together. How do we create public space  What does the word  public  mean today anyway  So  asked in that way  I think it raises great things about parliamentary ideas  democracy  public space  being together  being individual. How do we create an idea which is both tolerant to individuality  and also to collectivity  without polarizing the two into two different opposites  Of course the political agendas in the world has been very obsessed  polarizing the two against each other into different  very normative ideas. I would claim that art and culture  and this is why art and culture are so incredibly interesting in the times we're living in now  have proven that one can create a kind of a space which is both sensitive to individuality and to collectivity. It's very much about this causality  consequences. It's very much about the way we link thinking and doing. So what is between thinking and doing  And right in between thinking and doing  I would say  there is experience. And experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non casual way. Experience is about responsibility. Having an experience is taking part in the world. Taking part in the world is really about sharing responsibility. So art  in that sense  I think holds an incredible relevance in the world in which we're moving into  particularly right now. That's all I have. Thank you very much. So I am a pediatric cancer doctor and stem cell researcher at Stanford University where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation. Now  inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year  I didn't bring a human brain  but I did bring a liter of bone marrow. And bone marrow is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients  most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma and some other diseases. So  a few years ago  I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford. I'm in the operating room. We have Bob here  who is a volunteer donor. We're sending his marrow across the country to save the life of a child with leukemia. So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow  Well we have a whole O.R. team  general anesthesia  nurses  and another doctor across from me. Bob's on the table  and we take this sort of small needle  you know  not too big. And the way we do this is we basically place this through the soft tissue  and kind of punch it into the hard bone  into the tuchus    that's a technical term    and aspirate about    mls of bone marrow out  each time  with a syringe. And hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin. Hands it back to me. And we do that again and again. About     times usually. And by the end of this my arm is sore  I've got a callus on my hand  let alone Bob  whose rear end looks something more like this  like Swiss cheese. So I'm thinking  you know  this procedure hasn't changed in about    years. And there is probably a better way to do this. So I thought of a minimally invasive approach  and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner. This is it. And the Marrow Miner  the way it works is shown here. Our standard see through patient. Instead of entering the bone dozens of times  we enter just once  into the front of the hip or the back of the hip. And we have a flexible  powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip  as it moves around. So it enables you to very rapidly aspirate  or suck out  rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole. We can do multiple passes through that same entry. No robots required. And  so  very quickly  Bob can just get one puncture  local anesthesia  and do this harvest as an outpatient. So I did a few prototypes. I got a small little grant at Stanford. And played around with this a little bit. And our team members developed this technology. And eventually we got two large animals  and pig studies. And we found  to our surprise  that we not only got bone marrow out  but we got    times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the Marrow Miner  compared to the normal device. This device was just FDA approved in the last year. Here is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around. There will be two passes here  in the same patient  from the same hole. This was done under local anesthesia  as an outpatient. And we got  again  about three to six times more stem cells than the standard approach done on the same patient. So why should you care  Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells. You all know about embryonic stem cells. They've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials. Adult stem cells are throughout our body  including the blood forming stem cells in our bone marrow  which we've been using as a form of stem cell therapy for over    years. In the last decade there's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases such as heart disease  vascular disease  orthopedics  tissue engineering  even in neurology to treat Parkinson's and diabetes. We've just come out  we're commercializing  this year  generation  .  of the Marrow Miner. The hope is that this gets more stem cells out  which translates to better outcomes. It may encourage more people to sign up to be potential live saving bone marrow donors. It may even enable you to bank your own marrow stem cells  when you're younger and healthier  to use in the future should you need it. And ultimately    and here's a picture of our bone marrow transplant survivors  who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford. Hopefully this technology will let us have more of these survivors in the future. Thanks. I'm a neuroscientist  a professor at the University of California. And over the past    years  I've studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neurotransmitters  dopamine  things like that  all the way through circuit analysis. So that's what I normally do. But then  for some reason  I got into something else  just recently. And it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me to analyze a bunch of brains of psychopathic killers. And so this would be the typical talk I would give. And the question is   How do you end up with a psychopathic killer   What I mean by psychopathic killer are these people  these types of people. And so some of the brains that I've studied are people you know about. When I get the brains I don't know what I'm looking at. It's blind experiments. They also gave me normal people and everything. So I've looked at about    of these. And what came up was a number of pieces of data. So we look at these sorts of things theoretically  on the basis of genetics  and brain damage  and interaction with environment  and exactly how that machine works. So we're interested in exactly where in the brain  and what's the most important part of the brain. So we've been looking at this  the interaction of genes  what's called epigenetic effects  brain damage  and environment  and how these are tied together. And how you end up with a psychopath  and a killer  depends on exactly when the damage occurs. It's really a very precisely timed thing. You get different kinds of psychopaths. So we're going along with this. And here's  just to give you the pattern. The pattern is that those people  every one of them I looked at  who was a murderer  and was a serial killer  had damage to their orbital cortex  which is right above the eyes  the orbits  and also the interior part of the temporal lobe. So there is the pattern that every one of them had  but they all were a little different too. They had other sorts of brain damage. A key thing is that the major violence genes  it's called the MAO A gene. And there is a variant of this gene that is in the normal population. Some of you have this. And it's sex linked. It's on the X chromosome. And so in this way you can only get it from your mother. And in fact this is probably why mostly men  boys  are psychopathic killers  or are very aggressive. Because a daughter can get one X from the father  one X from the mother  it's kind of diluted out. But for a son  he can only get the X chromosome from his mother. So this is how it's passed from mother to son. And it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development  which is kind of interesting because serotonin is supposed to make you calm and relaxed. But if you have this gene  in utero your brain is bathed in this  so your whole brain becomes insensitive to serotonin  so it doesn't work later on in life. And I'd given this one talk in Israel  just this past year. And it does have some consequences. Theoretically what this means is that in order to express this gene  in a violent way  very early on  before puberty  you have to be involved in something that is really traumatic    not a little stress  not being spanked or something  but really seeing violence  or being involved in it  in  D. Right  That's how the mirror neuron system works. And so  if you have that gene  and you see a lot of violence in a certain situation  this is the recipe for disaster  absolute disaster. And what I think might happen in these areas of the world  where we have constant violence  you end up having generations of kids that are seeing all this violence. And if I was a young girl  somewhere in a violent area  you know  a    year old  and I want to find a mate  I'd find some tough guy  right  to protect me. Well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes. And now the boys and the girls get them. So I think after several generations  and here is the idea  we really have a tinderbox. So that was the idea. But then my mother said to me   I hear you've been going around talking about psychopathic killers. And you're talking as if you come from a normal family.  I said   What the hell are you talking about   She then told me about our own family tree. Now she blamed this on my father's side  of course. This was one of these cases  because she has no violence in her background  but my father did. Well she said   There is good news and bad news. One of your cousins is Ezra Cornell  founder of Cornell university. But the bad news is that your cousin is also Lizzie Borden. Now I said   Okay  so what  We have Lizzie.  She goes   No it gets worse  read this book.  And here is this  Killed Strangely   and it's this historical book. And the first murder of a mother by a son was my great great great great great great grandfather. Okay  so that's the first case of matricide. And that book is very interesting. Because it's about witch trials  and how people thought back then. But it doesn't stop there. There were seven more men  on my father's side  starting then  Cornells  that were all murderers. Okay  now this gives one a little pause. Because my father himself  and my three uncles  in World War II  were all conscientious objectors  all pussycats. But every once in a while  like Lizzie Borden  like three times a century  and we're kind of due. So the moral of the story is  people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. But more likely is this. And we had to take action. Now our kids found out about it. And they all seemed to be OK. But our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here. So what we've done is I've started to do PET scans of everybody in the family. We started to do PET scans  EEGs and genetic analysis to see where the bad news is. Now the only person    it turns out one son and one daughter  siblings  didn't get along and their patterns are exactly the same. They have the same brain  and the same EEG. And now they are close as can be. But there's gonna be bad news somewhere. And we don't know where it's going to pop up. So that's my talk. Interestingly  Charles Darwin was born a very lightly pigmented man  in a moderately to darkly pigmented world. Over the course of his life  Darwin had great privilege. He lived in a fairly wealthy home. He was raised by very supportive and interested parents. And when he was in his   s he embarked upon a remarkable voyage  on the ship the Beagle. And during the course of that voyage  he saw remarkable things  tremendous diversity of plants and animals  and humans. And the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book   On the Origin of Species   published     years ago. Now what is so interesting and to some  the extent  what's a bit infamous about  The Origin of Species   is that there is only one line in it about human evolution.  Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.  It wasn't until much longer  much later  that Darwin actually spoke and wrote about humans. Now in his years of traveling on the Beagle  and from listening to the accounts or explorers and naturalists  he knew that skin color was one of the most important ways in which people varied. And he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color. He knew that darkly pigmented peoples were found close to the equator  lightly pigmented peoples  like himself  were found closer to the poles. So what did he make of all this  Well he didn't write anything about it in The Origin of Species. But much later  in       he did have something to say about it. And it was quite curious. He said   Of all the differences between the races of men  the color of the skin is the most conspicuous and one of the best marked.  And he went on to say   These differences do not coincide with corresponding differences in climate.  So he had traveled all around. He had seen people of different colors living in different places. And yet he rejected the idea that human skin pigmentation was related to the climate. If only Darwin lived today. If only Darwin had NASA. Now  one of the wonderful things that NASA does is it puts up a variety of satellites that detect all sort of interesting things about our environment. And for many decades now there have been a series of TOMS satellites that have collected data about the radiation of the Earth's surface. The TOMS   satellite data  shown here  show the annual average ultraviolet radiation at the Earth's surface. Now the really hot pink and red areas are those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts of UV during the year. The incrementally cooler colors    blues  greens  yellows  and finally grays    indicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation. What's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation is just how much of the Northern Hemisphere is in these cool gray zones. This has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation. And what Darwin could not appreciate  or didn't perhaps want to appreciate at the time  is that there was a fundamental relationship between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and skin pigmentation. And that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution. And so when we look at a map of skin color  and predicted skin color  as we know it today  what we see is a beautiful gradient from the darkest skin pigmentations toward the equator  and the lightest ones toward the poles. What's very  very important here is that the earliest humans evolved in high UV environments  in equatorial Africa. The earliest members of our lineage  the genus Homo  were darkly pigmented. And we all share this incredible heritage of having originally been darkly pigmented  two million to one and half million years ago. Now what happened in our history  Let's first look at the relationship of ultraviolet radiation to the Earth's surface. In those early days of our evolution  looking at the equator  we were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation. The UVC  the most energetic type  was occluded by the Earth's atmosphere. But UVB and UVA especially  came in unimpeded. UVB turns out to be incredibly important. It's very destructive  but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin  vitamin D being a molecule that we very much need for our strong bones  the health of our immune system  and myriad other important functions in our bodies. So  living at the equator  we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin    this wonderful  complex  ancient polymer compound in our skin    served as a superb natural sunscreen. This polymer is amazing because it's present in so many different organisms. Melanin  in various forms  has probably been on the Earth a billion years  and has been recruited over and over again by evolution  as often happens. Why change it if it works  So melanin was recruited  in our lineage  and specifically in our earliest ancestors evolving in Africa  to be a natural sunscreen. Where it protected the body against the degradations of ultraviolet radiation  the destruction  or damage to DNA  and the breakdown of a very important molecule called folate  which helps to fuel cell production  and reproduction in the body. So  it's wonderful. We evolved this very protective  wonderful covering of melanin. But then we moved. And humans dispersed    not once  but twice. Major moves  outside of our equatorial homeland  from Africa into other parts of the Old World  and most recently  into the New World. When humans dispersed into these latitudes  what did they face  Conditions were significantly colder  but they were also less intense with respect to the ultraviolet regime. So if we're somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere  look at what's happening to the ultraviolet radiation. We're still getting a dose of UVA. But all of the UVB  or nearly all of it  is dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere. In the winter  when you are skiing in the Alps  you may experience ultraviolet radiation. But it's all UVA  and  significantly  that UVA has no ability to make vitamin D in your skin. So people inhabiting northern hemispheric environments were bereft of the potential to make vitamin D in their skin for most of the year. This had tremendous consequences for the evolution of human skin pigmentation. Because what happened  in order to ensure health and well being  these lineages of people dispersing into the Northern Hemisphere lost their pigmentation. There was natural selection for the evolution of lightly pigmented skin. Here we begin to see the evolution of the beautiful sepia rainbow that now characterizes all of humanity. Lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once  not just twice  but probably three times. Not just in modern humans  but in one of our distant unrelated ancestors  the Neanderthals. A remarkable  remarkable testament to the power of evolution. Humans have been on the move for a long time. And just in the last       years  in increasing rates  over increasing distances. Here are just some of the biggest movements of people  voluntary movements  in the last       years. Look at some of the major latitudinal transgressions  people from high UV areas going to low UV and vice versa. And not all these moves were voluntary. Between      and          million      people were moved from high UV to low UV areas in the transatlantic slave trade. Now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences. But it also had deleterious health consequences to people. So what  We've been on the move. We're so clever we can overcome all of these seeming biological impediments. Well  often we're unaware of the fact that we're living in environments in which our skin is inherently poorly adapted. Some of us with lightly pigmented skin live in high UV areas. Some of us with darkly pigmented skin live in low UV areas. These have tremendous consequences for our health. We have to  if we're lightly pigmented  be careful about the problems of skin cancer  and destruction of folate in our bodies  by lots of sun. Epidemiologists and doctors have been very good about telling us about protecting our skin. What they haven't been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas  or working inside all the time. Because the problem there is just as severe  but it is more sinister  because vitamin D deficiency  from a lack of ultraviolet B radiation  is a major problem. Vitamin D deficiency creeps up on people  and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones  to their gradual decay of their immune systems  or loss of immune function  and probably some problems with their mood and health  their mental health. So we have  in skin pigmentation  one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today. And the social consequences  as we know  are incredibly profound. We live in a world where we have lightly and darkly pigmented people living next to one another  but often brought into proximity initially as a result of very invidious social interactions. So how can we overcome this  How can we begin to understand it  Evolution helps us.     years after Darwin's birthday  we have the first moderately pigmented President of the United States. How wonderful is that  This man is significant for a whole host of reasons. But we need to think about how he compares  in terms of his pigmentation  to other people on Earth. He  as one of many urban admixed populations  is very emblematic of a mixed parentage  of a mixed pigmentation. And he resembles  very closely  people with moderate levels of pigmentation who live in southern Africa  or Southeast Asia. These people have a tremendous potential to tan  to develop more pigment in their skin  as a result of exposure to sun. They also run the risk of vitamin D deficiency  if they have desk jobs  like that guy. So lets all wish for his great health  and his awareness of his own skin pigmentation. Now what is wonderful about the evolution of human skin pigmentation  and the phenomenon of pigmentation  is that it is the demonstration  the evidence  of evolution by natural selection  right on your body. When people ask you   What is the evidence for evolution   You don't have to think about some exotic examples  or fossils. You just have to look at your skin. Darwin  I think  would have appreciated this  even though he eschewed the importance of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life. I think  were he able to look at the evidence we have today  he would understand it. He would appreciate it. And most of all  he would teach it. You  you can teach it. You can touch it. You can understand it. Take it out of this room. Take your skin color  and celebrate it. Spread the word. You have the evolution of the history of our species  part of it  written in your skin. Understand it. Appreciate it. Celebrate it. Go out. Isn't it beautiful  Isn't it wonderful  You are the products of evolution. Thank you. Can I say how delighted I am to be away from the calm of Westminster and Whitehall   Laughter  This is Kim  a nine year old Vietnam girl  her back ruined by napalm  and she awakened the conscience of the nation of America to begin to end the Vietnam War. This is Birhan  who was the Ethiopian girl who launched Live Aid in the     s     minutes away from death when she was rescued  and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world. This is Tiananmen Square. A man before a tank became a picture that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance. This next is the Sudanese girl  a few moments from death  a vulture hovering in the background  a picture that went round the world and shocked people into action on poverty. This is Neda  the Iranian girl who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in Iran only a few weeks ago  and she is now the focus  rightly so  of the YouTube generation. And what do all these pictures and events have in common  What they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see. What we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community. What these pictures demonstrate is that we do feel the pain of others  however distantly. What I think these pictures demonstrate is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves. What these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions  across all faiths  across all continents    a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others  and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted  see injuries that need to be corrected  see problems that need to be rectified. There is a story about Olof Palme  the Swedish Prime Minister  going to see Ronald Reagan in America in the     s. Before he arrived Ronald Reagan said    and he was the Swedish Social Democratic Prime Minister     Isn t this man a communist   The reply was   No  Mr President  he s an anti communist.  And Ronald Reagan said   I don t care what kind of communist he is   Ronald Reagan asked Olof Palme  the Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden   Well  what do you believe in  Do you want to abolish the rich   He said   No  I want to abolish the poor.  Our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance to realize their potential to the full. I believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith  and people of no faith. But I think what's new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world. We now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet  but who we will meet through the Internet and through all the modern means of communication  that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with  and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history  and it is the start of what I would call the creation of a truly global society. Go back     years when the slave trade was under pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters. They protested across Britain. They won public opinion over a long period of time. But it took    years for the campaign to be successful. What could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people s hearts and minds  Or if you take Eglantyne Jebb  the woman who created Save the Children    years ago. She was so appalled by what was happening in Austria as a result of the First World War and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated families of Austria  that in Britain she wanted to take action  but she had to go house to house  leaflet to leaflet  to get people to attend a rally in the Royal Albert Hall that eventually gave birth to Save the Children  an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world. But what more could she have done if she d had the modern means of communications available to her to create a sense that the injustice that people saw had to be acted upon immediately  Now look at what s happened in the last    years. In Philippines in       President Estrada    a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime  eventually brought it down and it was  of course  called the  coup de text.   Laughter  Then you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago. Because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening at the polling stations  it was impossible for that Premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do. Or take Burma and the monks that were blogging out  a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening  until these blogs told the world that there was a repression  meaning that lives were being lost and people were being persecuted and Aung San Suu Kyi  who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world  had to be listened to. Then take Iran itself  and what people are doing today  following what happened to Neda  people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people who are blogging out of Iran  any by everybody who is blogging  changing their address to Tehran  Iran  and making it difficult for the security services. Take  therefore  what modern technology is capable of  the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize internationally. That  in my view  gives us the first opportunity as a community to fundamentally change the world. Foreign policy can never be the same again. It cannot be run by elites  it s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging  who are communicating with each other around the world.     years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery.     years ago I suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people  children  had the right to education.     years ago in most countries in Europe  the pressure was for the right to vote.    years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare. In the last       years we have seen fascism  anti Semitism  racism  apartheid  discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality  all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world. I was with Nelson Mandela a year ago  when he was in London. I was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation. I was sitting next to Nelson Mandela    I was very privileged to do so    when Amy Winehouse came onto the stage.  Laughter  And Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and I was explaining to him at the time who she was. Amy Winehouse said   Nelson Mandela and I have a lot in common. My husband too has spent a long time in prison.  Nelson Mandela then went down to the stage and he summarized the challenge for us all. He said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain  the mountain of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid. He said that there was a greater challenge ahead  the challenge of poverty  of climate change    global challenges that needed global solutions and needed the creation of a truly global society. We are the first generation which is in a position to do this. Combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally  with the challenges that we now face  most of which are global in their nature. Climate change cannot be solved in one country  but has got to be solved by the world working together. A financial crisis  just as we have seen  could not be solved by America alone or Europe alone  it needed the world to work together. Take the problems of security and terrorism and  equally  the problem of human rights and development  they cannot be solved by Africa alone  they cannot be solved by America or Europe alone. We cannot solve these problems unless we work together. So the great project of our generation  it seems to me  is to build for the first time  out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together  a truly global society  built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future. We have now  and are the first generation with  the power to do this. Take climate change. Is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem  where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that  when we want to create a global carbon market  but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem  One of the things that has got to come out of Copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world to move along a climate change agenda. One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well  so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations. Take the financial crisis. If people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in New York or starts in the sub prime market of the United States of America. If people can find that that sub prime product has been transferred across nations many  many times until it ends up in banks in Iceland or the rest in Britain  and people's ordinary savings are affected by it  then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision. You need in the long run for stability  for economic growth  for jobs  as well as for financial stability  global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared  and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible. So another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility  not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years. Then take development and take the partnership we need between our countries and the rest of the world  the poorest part of the world. We do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future  and yet  out of people s desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done. I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone. This is a country of six and a half million people  but it has only    doctors  it has     nurses  it has     midwives. You cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people with such limited resources. Or take the girl I met when I was in Tanzania  a girl called Miriam. She was    years old  her parents had both died from AIDS  her mother and then her father. She was an AIDS orphan being handed across different extended families to be cared for. She herself was suffering from HIV  she was suffering from tuberculosis. I met her in a field  she was ragged  she had no shoes. When you looked in her eyes  any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future  but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl s eyes and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment  I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV AIDS fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations. We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture  so that Africa is not a net importer of food  but an exporter of food. Take the problems of human rights and the problems of security in so many countries around the world. Burma is in chains  Zimbabwe is a human tragedy  in Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent. In the Rwanda Children's Museum  there is a photograph of a    year old boy and the Children's Museum is commemorating the lives that were lost in the Rwandan genocide where a million people died. There is a photograph of a boy called David. Beside that photograph there is the information about his life. It said  David  age   .  David  ambition to be a doctor. Favorite sport  football. What did he enjoy most  Making people laugh. How did he die  Tortured to death. Last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death   Don't worry. The United Nations are coming.  And we never did. And that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda  and we never did. So we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid  but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict ridden states of the world. So my argument today is basically this. We have the means by which we could create a truly global society. The institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors. That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work  but we should not lose the chance in this generation  in this decade in particular  with President Obama in America  with other people working with us around the world  to create global institutions for the environment  and for finance  and for security and for development  that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples  our desire to bind the world together  and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist. It is said that in Ancient Rome that when Cicero spoke to his audiences  people used to turn to each other and say about Cicero   Great speech.  But it is said that in Ancient Greece when Demosthenes spoke to his audiences  people turned to each other and didn t say  Great speech.  They said   Let's march.  We should be marching towards a global society. Thank you. For me they normally happen  these career crises  often  actually  on a Sunday evening  just as the sun is starting to set  and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life starts to diverge so painfully that I normally end up weeping into a pillow. I'm mentioning all this    I'm mentioning all this because I think this is not merely a personal problem  you may think I'm wrong in this  but I think we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises  by moments when what we thought we knew    about our lives  about our careers    comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality. It's perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living. It's perhaps harder than ever before to stay calm  to be free of career anxiety. I want to look now  if I may  at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers. Why we might be victims of these career crises  as we're weeping softly into our pillows. One of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by snobs. In a way  I've got some bad news  particularly to anybody who's come to Oxford from abroad. There's a real problem with snobbery  because sometimes people from outside the U.K. imagine that snobbery is a distinctively U.K. phenomenon  fixated on country houses and titles. The bad news is that's not true. Snobbery is a global phenomenon  we are a global organization  this is a global phenomenon. What is a snob  A snob is anybody who takes a small part of you  and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are. That is snobbery. The dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery. You encounter it within minutes at a party  when you get asked that famous iconic question of the early   st century   What do you do   According to how you answer that question  people are either incredibly delighted to see you  or look at their watch and make their excuses. Now  the opposite of a snob is your mother. Not necessarily your mother  or indeed mine  but  as it were  the ideal mother  somebody who doesn't care about your achievements. Unfortunately  most people are not our mothers. Most people make a strict correlation between how much time  and if you like  love    not romantic love  though that may be something    but love in general  respect    they are willing to accord us  that will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy. And that's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods. You know  we're often told that we live in very materialistic times  that we're all greedy people. I don't think we are particularly materialistic. I think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods. It's not the material goods we want  it's the rewards we want. It's a new way of looking at luxury goods. The next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari  don't think   This is somebody who's greedy.  Think   This is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love.  Feel sympathy  rather than contempt. There are other reasons    There are other reasons why it's perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before. One of these  and it's paradoxical  because it's linked to something that's rather nice  is the hope we all have for our careers. Never before have expectations been so high about what human beings can achieve with their lifespan. We're told  from many sources  that anyone can achieve anything. We've done away with the caste system  we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please. And it's a beautiful idea. Along with that is a kind of spirit of equality  we're all basically equal. There are no strictly defined hierarchies. There is one really big problem with this  and that problem is envy. Envy  it's a real taboo to mention envy  but if there's one dominant emotion in modern society  that is envy. And it's linked to the spirit of equality. Let me explain. I think it would be very unusual for anyone here  or anyone watching  to be envious of the Queen of England. Even though she is much richer than any of you are  and she's got a very large house  the reason why we don't envy her is because she's too weird. She's simply too strange. We can't relate to her  she speaks in a funny way  she comes from an odd place. So we can't relate to her  and when you can't relate to somebody  you don't envy them. The closer two people are    in age  in background  in the process of identification    the more there's a danger of envy  which is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion  because there is no stronger reference point than people one was at school with. The problem of modern society is it turns the whole world into a school. Everybody's wearing jeans  everybody's the same. And yet  they're not. So there's a spirit of equality combined with deep inequality  which can make for a very stressful situation. It's probably as unlikely that you would nowadays become as rich and famous as Bill Gates  as it was unlikely in the   th century that you would accede to the ranks of the French aristocracy. But the point is  it doesn't feel that way. It's made to feel  by magazines and other media outlets  that if you've got energy  a few bright ideas about technology  a garage    you  too  could start a major thing. The consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops. When you go to a large bookshop and look at the self help sections  as I sometimes do    if you analyze self help books produced in the world today  there are basically two kinds. The first kind tells you   You can do it  You can make it  Anything's possible   The other kind tells you how to cope with what we politely call  low self esteem   or impolitely call   feeling very bad about yourself.  There's a real correlation between a society that tells people that they can do anything  and the existence of low self esteem. So that's another way in which something quite positive can have a nasty kickback. There is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious    about our careers  about our status in the world today  than ever before. And it's  again  linked to something nice. And that nice thing is called meritocracy. Everybody  all politicians on Left and Right  agree that meritocracy is a great thing  and we should all be trying to make our societies really  really meritocratic. In other words    what is a meritocratic society  A meritocratic society is one in which  if you've got talent and energy and skill  you will get to the top  nothing should hold you back. It's a beautiful idea. The problem is  if you really believe in a society where those who merit to get to the top  get to the top  you'll also  by implication  and in a far more nasty way  believe in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there. In other words  your position in life comes to seem not accidental  but merited and deserved. And that makes failure seem much more crushing. You know  in the Middle Ages  in England  when you met a very poor person  that person would be described as an  unfortunate     literally  somebody who had not been blessed by fortune  an unfortunate. Nowadays  particularly in the United States  if you meet someone at the bottom of society  they may unkindly be described as a  loser.  There's a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser  and that shows     years of evolution in society and our belief in who is responsible for our lives. It's no longer the gods  it's us. We're in the driving seat. That's exhilarating if you're doing well  and very crushing if you're not. It leads  in the worst cases    in the analysis of a sociologist like Emil Durkheim    it leads to increased rates of suicide. There are more suicides in developed  individualistic countries than in any other part of the world. And some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally    they own their success  but they also own their failure. Is there any relief from some of these pressures that I've been outlining  I think there is. I just want to turn to a few of them. Let's take meritocracy. This idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to  I think it's a crazy idea  completely crazy. I will support any politician of Left and Right  with any halfway decent meritocratic idea  I am a meritocrat in that sense. But I think it's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic  it's an impossible dream. The idea that we will make a society where literally everybody is graded  the good at the top  bad at the bottom  exactly done as it should be  is impossible. There are simply too many random factors  accidents  accidents of birth  accidents of things dropping on people's heads  illnesses  etc. We will never get to grade them  never get to grade people as they should. I'm drawn to a lovely quote by St. Augustine in  The City of God   where he says   It's a sin to judge any man by his post.  In modern English that would mean it's a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to  dependent on their business card. It's not the post that should count. According to St. Augustine  only God can really put everybody in their place  he's going to do that on the Day of Judgment  with angels and trumpets  and the skies will open. Insane idea  if you're a secularist person  like me. But something very valuable in that idea  nevertheless. In other words  hold your horses when you're coming to judge people. You don't necessarily know what someone's true value is. That is an unknown part of them  and we shouldn't behave as though it is known. There is another source of solace and comfort for all this. When we think about failing in life  when we think about failure  one of the reasons why we fear failing is not just a loss of income  a loss of status. What we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others. And it exists. The number one organ of ridicule  nowadays  is the newspaper. If you open the newspaper any day of the week  it's full of people who've messed up their lives. They've slept with the wrong person  taken the wrong substance  passed the wrong piece of legislation    whatever it is  and then are fit for ridicule. In other words  they have failed. And they are described as  losers.  Now  is there any alternative to this  I think the Western tradition shows us one glorious alternative  which is tragedy. Tragic art  as it developed in the theaters of ancient Greece  in the fifth century B.C.  was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail  and also according them a level of sympathy  which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them. A few years ago  I was thinking about this  and I went to  The Sunday Sport   a tabloid newspaper I don't recommend you start reading if you're not familiar with it already. And I went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of Western art. I wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories  if they came in as a news item at the news desk on a Saturday afternoon. I mentioned Othello  they'd not heard of it but were fascinated. I asked them to write a headline for the story. They came up with  Love Crazed Immigrant Kills Senator's Daughter.  Splashed across the headline. I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary. Again  a book they were enchanted to discover. And they wrote  Shopaholic Adulteress Swallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud.  And then my favorite    they really do have a kind of genius of their own  these guys    my favorite is Sophocles' Oedipus the King   Sex With Mum Was Blinding.  In a way  if you like  at one end of the spectrum of sympathy  you've got the tabloid newspaper. At the other end of the spectrum  you've got tragedy and tragic art. And I suppose I'm arguing that we should learn a little bit about what's happening in tragic art. It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser. He is not a loser  though he has lost. And I think that is the message of tragedy to us  and why it's so very  very important  I think. The other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety  is that we have nothing at its center that is non human. We are the first society to be living in a world where we don't worship anything other than ourselves. We think very highly of ourselves  and so we should  we've put people on the Moon  done all sorts of extraordinary things. And so we tend to worship ourselves. Our heroes are human heroes. That's a very new situation. Most other societies have had  right at their center  the worship of something transcendent  a god  a spirit  a natural force  the universe  whatever it is    something else that is being worshiped. We've slightly lost the habit of doing that  which is  I think  why we're particularly drawn to nature. Not for the sake of our health  though it's often presented that way  but because it's an escape from the human anthill. It's an escape from our own competition  and our own dramas. And that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans  and contemplating the Earth from outside its perimeters  etc. We like to feel in contact with something that is non human  and that is so deeply important to us. What I think I've been talking about really is success and failure. And one of the interesting things about success is that we think we know what it means. If I said that there's somebody behind the screen who's very successful  certain ideas would immediately come to mind. You'd think that person might have made a lot of money  achieved renown in some field. My own theory of success    I'm somebody who's very interested in success  I really want to be successful  always thinking  how can I be more successful  But as I get older  I'm also very nuanced about what that word  success  might mean. Here's an insight that I've had about success  You can't be successful at everything. We hear a lot of talk about work life balance. Nonsense. You can't have it all. You can't. So any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on  where the element of loss is. And I think any wise life will accept  as I say  that there is going to be an element where we're not succeeding. And the thing about a successful life is that a lot of the time  our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own. They're sucked in from other people  chiefly  if you're a man  your father  and if you're a woman  your mother. Psychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about    years. No one's quite listening hard enough  but I very much believe it's true. And we also suck in messages from everything from the television  to advertising  to marketing  etc. These are hugely powerful forces that define what we want and how we view ourselves. When we're told that banking is a very respectable profession  a lot of us want to go into banking. When banking is no longer so respectable  we lose interest in banking. We are highly open to suggestion. So what I want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success  but we should make sure that they are our own. We should focus in on our ideas  and make sure that we own them  that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions. Because it's bad enough not getting what you want  but it's even worse to have an idea of what it is you want  and find out  at the end of the journey  that it isn't  in fact  what you wanted all along. So  I'm going to end it there. But what I really want to stress is  by all means  success  yes. But let's accept the strangeness of some of our ideas. Let's probe away at our notions of success. Let's make sure our ideas of success are truly our own. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  That was fascinating. But how do you reconcile this idea of it being bad to think of someone as a  loser   with the idea that a lot of people like  of seizing control of your life  and that a society that encourages that  perhaps has to have some winners and losers  Alain De Botton  Yes  I think it's merely the randomness of the winning and losing process that I want to stress  because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything  and politicians always talk about justice. Now I'm a firm believer in justice  I just think that it's impossible. So we should do everything we can to pursue it  but we should always remember that whoever is facing us  whatever has happened in their lives  there will be a strong element of the haphazard. That's what I'm trying to leave room for  otherwise  it can get quite claustrophobic. CA  I mean  do you believe that you can combine your kind of kinder  gentler philosophy of work with a successful economy  Or do you think that you can't  but it doesn't matter that much that we're putting too much emphasis on that  AB  The nightmare thought is that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them  and that somehow the crueler the environment  the more people will rise to the challenge. You want to think  who would you like as your ideal dad  And your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle. And it's a very hard line to make. We need fathers  as it were  the exemplary father figures in society  avoiding the two extremes  which is the authoritarian disciplinarian on the one hand  and on the other  the lax  no rules option. CA  Alain De Botton. AB  Thank you very much. Hello  My name is Golan Levin. I'm an artist and an engineer  which is  increasingly  a more common kind of hybrid. But I still fall into this weird crack where people don't seem to understand me. And I was looking around and I found this wonderful picture. It's a letter from  Artforum  in      saying  We can't imagine ever doing a special issue on electronics or computers in art.  And they still haven't. And lest you think that you all  as the digerati  are more enlightened  I went to the Apple iPhone app store the other day. Where's art  I got productivity. I got sports. And somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iPhone  which my friends and I are doing now  is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for. So  from both directions  there is kind of  I think  a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day  or her own day  which I think artists are obliged to do  is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have. In my own case  I'm an artist  and I'm really interested in expanding the vocabulary of human action  and basically empowering people through interactivity. I want people to discover themselves as actors  as creative actors  by having interactive experiences. A lot of my work is about trying to get away from this. This a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine. And when I say desktop  I don't just mean the actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface of the desk. If you look carefully  you can even see a hint of the Apple menu  up here in the upper left  where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical. So this is  as Joy Mountford once said   The mouse is probably the narrowest straw you could try to suck all of human expression through.  And the thing I'm really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich kinds of interactive experiences. How can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies as a way of exploring aesthetic experiences  not necessarily utilitarian ones. So I write software. And that's how I do it. And a lot of my experiences resemble mirrors in some way. Because this is  in some sense  the first way  that people discover their own potential as actors  and discover their own agency. By saying  Who is that person in the mirror  Oh it's actually me.  And so  to give an example  this is a project from last year  which is called the Interstitial Fragment Processor. And it allows people to explore the negative shapes that they create when they're just going about their everyday business. So as people make shapes with their hands or their heads and so forth  or with each other  these shapes literally produce sounds and drop out of thin air    basically taking what's often this  kind of  unseen space  or this undetected space  and making it something real  that people then can appreciate and become creative with. So again  people discover their creative agency in this way. And their own personalities come out in totally unique ways. So in addition to using full body input  something that I've explored now  for a while  has been the use of the voice  which is an immensely expressive system for us  vocalizing. Song is one of our oldest ways of making ourselves heard and understood. And I came across this fantastic research by Wolfgang K hler  the so called father of gestalt psychology  from       who submitted to an audience like yourselves the following two shapes. And he said one of them is called Maluma. And one of them is called Taketa. Which is which  Anyone want to hazard a guess  Maluma is on top. Yeah. So. As he says here  most people answer without any hesitation. So what we're really seeing here is a phenomenon called phonaesthesia  which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have. And so  whereas Dr. Oliver Sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia  where they hear colors or taste shapes  and things like this  phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent. It's about mappings between different perceptual domains  like hardness  sharpness  brightness and darkness  and the phonemes that we're able to speak with. So    years on  there's been some research where cognitive psychologists have actually sussed out the extent to which  you know  L  M and B are more associated with shapes that look like this  and P  T and K are perhaps more associated with shapes like this. And here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically  a relative mapping between curvature and shape. So it occurred to me  what happens if we could run these backwards  And thus was born the project called Remark  which is a collaboration with Zachary Lieberman and the Ars Electronica Futurelab. And this is an interactive installation which presents the fiction that speech casts visible shadows. So the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light. And as you do  you see the shadows of your own speech. And they sort of fly away  out of your head. If a computer speech recognition system is able to recognize what you're saying  then it spells it out. And if it isn't then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically tightly coupled to the sounds you made. So let's bring up a video of that. Thanks. So. And this project here  I was working with the great abstract vocalist  Jaap Blonk. And he is a world expert in performing  The Ursonate   which is a half an hour nonsense poem by Kurt Schwitters  written in the     s  which is half an hour of very highly patterned nonsense. And it's almost impossible to perform. But Jaap is one of the world experts in performing it. And in this project we've developed a form of intelligent real time subtitles. So these are our live subtitles  that are being produced by a computer that knows the text of  The Ursonate     fortunately Jaap does too  very well    and it is delivering that text at the same time as Jaap is. So all the text you're going to see is real time generated by the computer  visualizing what he's doing with his voice. Here you can see the set up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him. Okay. So ... The full videos are online if you are interested. I got a split reaction to that during the live performance  because there is some people who understand live subtitles are a kind of an oxymoron  because usually there is someone making them afterwards. And then a bunch of people who were like   What's the big deal  I see subtitles all the time on television.  You know  They don't imagine the person in the booth  typing it all. So in addition to the full body  and in addition to the voice  another thing that I've been really interested in  most recently  is the use of the eyes  or the gaze  in terms of how people relate to each other. It's a really profound amount of nonverbal information that's communicated with the eyes. And it's one of the most interesting technical challenges that's very currently active in the computer sciences  being able to have a camera that can understand  from a fairly big distance away  how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal what you're interested in  and where your attention is directed. So there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there. And so I've been beginning  with a variety of different projects  to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes. And basically to ask the questions  What if art was aware that we were looking at it  How could it respond  in a way  to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we're looking at it  And what could it do if it could look back at us  And so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects. In the first one which I'm going to show you  called Eyecode  it's a piece of interactive software in which  if we read this little circle   the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer.  The idea is that it's an image wholly constructed from its own history of being viewed by different people in an installation. So let me just switch over so we can do the live demo. So let's run this and see if it works. Okay. Ah  there is lots of nice bright video. There is just a little test screen that shows that it's working. And what I'm just going to do is    I'm going to hide that. And you can see here that what it's doing is it's recording my eyes every time I blink. Hello  And I can ... hello ... okay. And no matter where I am  what's really going on here is that it's an eye tracking system that tries to locate my eyes. And if I get really far away I'm blurry. You know  you're going to have these kind of blurry spots like this that maybe only resemble eyes in a very very abstract way. But if I come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop then you'll see these nice crisp eyes. You can think of it as a way of  sort of  typing  with your eyes. And what you're typing are recordings of your eyes as you're looking at other peoples' eyes. So each person is looking at the looking of everyone else before them. And this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at  as you see who's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them. So I'll just add a couple more. Blink. Blink. And you can see  just once again  how it's sort of finding my eyes and doing its best to estimate when it's blinking. Alright. Let's leave that. So that's this kind of recursive observation system. Thank you. The last couple pieces I'm going to show are basically in the new realm of robotics    for me  new for me. It's called Opto Isolator. And I'm going to show a video of the older version of it  which is just a minute long. Okay. In this case  the Opto Isolator is blinking in response to one's own blinks. So it blinks one second after you do. This is a device which is intended to reduce the phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials. Just one eye  looking at you  and eliminating everything else about a face  but just to consider gaze in an isolated way as a kind of  as an element. And at the same time  it attempts to engage in what you might call familiar psycho social gaze behaviors. Like looking away if you look at it too long because it gets shy  or things like that. Okay. So the last project I'm going to show is this new one called Snout. It's an eight foot snout  with a googly eye. And inside it's got an     pound robot arm that I borrowed  from a friend. It helps to have good friends. I'm at Carnegie Mellon  we've got a great Robotics Institute there. I'd like to show you thing called Snout  which is    The idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it's continually surprised to see you. The idea is that basically    if it's constantly like  Huh  ... Huh   That's why its other name is Doubletaker  Taker of Doubles. It's always kind of doing a double take   What   And the idea is basically  can it look at you and make you feel as if like   What  Is it my shoes    Got something on my hair   Here we go. Alright. Checking him out ... For you nerds  here's a little behind the scenes. It's got a computer vision system  and it tries to look at the people who are moving around the most. Those are its targets. Up there is the skeleton  which is actually what it's trying to do. It's really about trying to create a novel body language for a new creature. Hollywood does this all the time  of course. But also have the body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it. This language is communicating that it is surprised to see you  and it's interested in looking at you. Thank you very much. That's all I've got for today. And I'm really happy to be here. Thank you so much. Well  this is     . And it's the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin. And all over the world  eminent evolutionists are anxious to celebrate this. And what they're planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect of Darwin and his life  and how he changed our thinking. I say almost every aspect  because there is one aspect of this story which they have thrown no light on. And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something else. So I'm going to talk about it. It's the question of  why are we so different from the chimpanzees  We get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related    hardly any genes of difference  very  very closely related. And yet  when you look at the phenotypes  there's a chimp  there's a man  they're astoundingly different  no resemblance at all. I'm not talking about airy fairy stuff about culture or psychology  or behavior. I'm talking about ground base  nitty gritty  measurable physical differences. They  that one  is hairy and walking on four legs. That one is a naked biped. Why  I mean    if I'm a good Darwinist  I've got to believe there's a reason for that. If we changed so much  something must have happened. What happened  Now    years ago  that was a laughably simple question. Everybody knew the answer. They knew what happened. The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees  our ancestors went out onto the plain. That explained everything. We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass  or to chase after animals  or to free our hands for weapons. And we got so overheated in the chase that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away. Everybody knew that  for generations. But then  in the '  s  something began to unravel. The paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely at the accompanying microfauna that lived in the same time and place as the hominids. And they weren't savanna species. And they looked at the herbivores. And they weren't savanna herbivores. And then they were so clever  they found a way to analyze fossilized pollen. Shock  horror. The fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation. Some of it even came from lianas  those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle. So we're left with a situation where we know that our earliest ancestors were moving around on four legs in the trees  before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence. This is not something I've made up. It's not a minority theory. Everybody agrees with it. Professor Tobias came over from South Africa and spoke to University College London. He said   Everything I've been telling you for the last    years  forget about it. It was wrong. We've got to go back to square one and start again.  It made him very unpopular. They didn't want to go back to square one. I mean  it's a terrible thing to happen. You've got this beautiful paradigm. You've believed it through generations. Nobody has questioned it. You've been constructing fanciful things on top of it  relying on it to be as solid as a rock. And now it's whipped away from under you. What do you do  What does a scientist do in that case  Well  we know the answer because Thomas S. Kuhn wrote a seminal treatise about this back in     . He said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is  guess what    they carry on as if nothing had happened. If they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question. So they say   Yes it's wrong  but supposing it was right ...  And the only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions. So that is what they have done now. That's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question. Some of them have even elevated it into a principle. It's what we ought to be doing. Aaron Filler from Harvard said   Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures  I mean  why don't we talk about  well  there's chromosomes  and there's genes. And we just record what we see.  Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave  He knew all about that kind of science. And he called it hypothesis free science. And he despised it from the bottom of his heart. And if you're going to say   I'm going to stop talking about selective pressures   you can take  The Origin of Species  and throw it out of the window  for it's about nothing else but selective pressures. And the irony of it is  that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse where we didn't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up. There was one waiting in the wings. It had been waiting there since      when Alister Hardy  a marine biologist  said   I think what happened  perhaps our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time.  He kept it to himself for    years. But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose. All his colleagues said   This is outrageous. You've exposed us to public ridicule  You must never do that again.  And at that time  it became set in stone  the aquatic theory should be dumped with the UFOs and the yetis  as part of the lunatic fringe of science. Well I don't think that. I think that Hardy had a lot going for him. I'd like to talk about just a handful of what have been called the hallmarks of mankind  the things that made us different from everybody else  and all our relatives. Let's look at our naked skin. It's obvious that most of the things we think about that have lost their body hair  mammals without body hair  are aquatic ones  like the dugong  the walrus  the dolphin  the hippopotamus  the manatee. And a couple of wallowers in mud like the babirusa. And you're tempted to think  well perhaps  could that be why we are naked  I suggested it and people said   No no no. I mean  look at the elephant. You've forgotten all about the elephant haven't you   So back in      I said   Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.  Peals of merry laughter   That crazy woman. She's off again. She'll say anything won't she   But by now  everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor. This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors. The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros. Last year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros and said   Seems to have spent most of its time in the water.  So this is a close connection between nakedness and water. As an absolute connection  it only works one way. You can't say all aquatic animals are naked  because look at the sea otter. But you can say that every animal that has become naked has been conditioned by water  in its own lifetime  or the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant. The only exception is the naked Somalian mole rat  which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground. And take bipedality. Here you can't find anybody to compare it with  because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs. But you can say this  all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs  if they want to  for a short time. There is only one circumstance in which they always  all of them  walk on two legs  and that is when they are wading through water. Do you think that's significant  David Attenborough thinks it's significant  as the possible beginning of our bipedalism. Look at the fat layer. We have got  under our skin  a layer of fat  all over  nothing in the least like that in any other primate. Why should it be there  Well they do know  that if you look at other aquatic mammals  the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall  around the kidneys and the intestines and so on  has started to migrate to the outside  and spread out in a layer inside the skin. In the whale it's complete  no fat inside at all  all in blubber outside. We cannot avoid the suspicion that in our case it's started to happen. We have got skin lined with this layer. It's the only possible explanation of why humans  if they're very unlucky  can become grossly obese  in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate  physically impossible. Something very odd  matter of factly  never explained. The question of why we can speak. We can speak. And the gorilla can't speak. Why  Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that    purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath. You can't even train a gorilla to say  Ah  on request. The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath are the diving animals and the diving birds. It was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak. And then again  there is the fact that we are streamlined. Trying to imagine a diver diving into water    hardly makes a splash. Try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver  and you can see that  compared with gorilla  we are halfway to being shaped like a fish. I am trying to suggest that  for    odd years  this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe  and it is not lunatic fringe. And the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own  which they've all agreed on  and they love. There is nothing there. They are staving off the aquatic theory to protect a vacuum. How do they react when I say these things  One very common reaction I've heard about    times is   But it was investigated. They conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning  when Hardy put forward his article.  I don't believe it. For    years I've been looking for any evidence of any incident of that kind  and I've concluded that that's one of the urban myths. It's never been done. I ask people sometimes  and they say   I like the aquatic theory  Everybody likes the aquatic theory. Of course they don't believe it  but they like it.  Well I say   Why do you think it's rubbish   They say  Well ... everybody I talk to says it's rubbish. And they can't all be wrong  can they   The answer to that  loud and clear  is   Yes  They can all be wrong.  History is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong. And if you've got a scientific problem like that  you can't solve it by holding a head count  and saying   More of us say yes than say no.  Apart from that  some of the heads count more than others. Some of them have come over. There was Professor Tobias. He's come over. Daniel Dennett  he's come over. Sir David Attenborough  he's come over. Anybody else out there  Come on in. The water is lovely. And now we've got to look to the future. Ultimately one of three things is going to happen. Either they will go on for the next    years     years     years.  Yeah well we don't talk about that. Let's talk about something interesting.  That would be very sad. The second thing that could happen is that some young genius will arrive  and say   I've found it. It was not the savanna  it was not the water  it was this   No sign of that happening either. I don't think there is a third option. So the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing. If you look back at the early years of the last century  there was a stand off  a lot of bickering and bad feeling between the believers in Mendel  and the believers in Darwin. It ended with a new synthesis  Darwin's ideas and Mendel's ideas blending together. And I think the same thing will happen here. You'll get a new synthesis. Hardy's ideas and Darwin's ideas will be blended together. And we can move forward from there  and really get somewhere. That would be a beautiful thing. It would be very nice for me if it happened soon. Because I'm older now than George Burns was when he said   At my age  I don't even buy green bananas.  So if it's going to come and it's going to happen  what's holding it up  I can tell you that in three words. Academia says no. They decided in        That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis.  And it's not easy to change their minds. The professional journals won't touch it with a barge pole. The textbooks don't mention it. The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked  let alone look for a reason to it.  Horizon   which takes its cue from the academics  won't touch it with a barge pole. So we never hear the case put for it  except in jocular references to people on the lunatic fringe. I don't know quite where this diktat comes from. Somebody up there is issuing the commandment   Thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory. And if you hope to make progress in this profession  and you do believe it  you'd better keep it to yourself  because it will get in your way.  So I get the impression that some parts of the scientific establishment are morphing into a kind of priesthood. But you know  that makes me feel good  because Richard Dawkins has told us how to treat a priesthood. He says   Firstly  you've got to refuse to give it all the excessive awe and reverence it's been trained to receive.  Right. I'll go ahead with that. And secondly  he says   You must never be afraid to rock the boat.  I'll go along with that too. Thank you very much. There's an old saying   Just because you can't see something  doesn't mean it's not there.  My work is    it's a reflection of myself. What I wanted to do is to show the world that the little things can be the biggest things. We all seem to think that  you know  if we look down on the ground  there's nothing there. And we use the word  nothing.  Nothing doesn't exist  because there is always something. My mother told me that  when I was a child  that I should always respect the little things. What made me do this work  I shall go into my story. This all started when I was age five. What made me do it  At school  I will admit this  academically  I couldn't express myself. So I was  more or less  classed as  nothing.  My world was seen as less. So I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world. I thought  I need to retreat into something else. So when my mother used to take me to school  she thought I was at school  and I used to do a U turn  when her back was turned  and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden. Now  the one time I was in the shed  and my mother suspected something  thinking I was at school. My mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry. So you'd just see her feet. So I was hiding in the shed  like that. And all of a sudden ... And then I saw her legs. And then she said    grabbed me like that  because my mother was quite big    and she lifted me up and she says   How come you're not at school   I told her I couldn't face it because the way the teacher was treating me  ridiculing me  and using me as an example of failure. So I told her. At that age  obviously  I couldn't express it that way  but I told her I didn't feel right. And then she just said   You're going back to school tomorrow.  And walked off. And I didn't expect that  because I expected one of these ... But I didn't get it. So I'm sitting there thinking. And as I looked down on the ground  I noticed there was some ants running around. And I went into this little fantasy world. And I thought   These ants  are they looking for the queen ant  Or do they need somewhere to live   So I thought  Perhaps  if I made these ants some apartments  they'll move in.  So I did. And how I set about that  I got some splinters of wood. And I sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass  constructed this little apartment. Well it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished. But I thought  perhaps the ant won't know  it'll probably move in. And so they did. That was a bit crude  at the time. And I made all these little apartments and little merry go rounds  seesaws and swings  little ladders. And then I encouraged the ants to come 'round by putting sugar and things like that. And then I sat down and all the ants came along. And all I could hear was  Is this for us   And I say   Yes  they're all for you.  And they moved in  and decided not to pay me any rent. And from there I was watching this little world. It became part of me. When I discovered that I had this gift  I wanted to experiment with this world that we can't see. So I realized that there was more to life than just everything that we see around us that's huge. So I started to educate myself on this molecular level. And as I got older  I continued. I showed my mother. My mother told me to take it smaller. Now I shall show you something here. And I'll explain. As you can see  that's a pinhead. Now that is called the Huf Haus. The gentleman who commissioned me to do this was a gentleman called Peter Huf. And he says to me  Willard  can you put my house on a pinhead   So I say   How are you going to fit in there   And then he said to me   I don't believe you can do it. Can you really do it   And I says   Well  try me.  And then he said   But I don't believe that you can do this.  So I said   OK.  So  to cut a long story short  I went home  went underneath the microscope  and I crushed up a piece of glass  crushed it up. And underneath the microscope there were splinters of glass. Some of them were quite jagged. So I was crushing up these pieces of glass  which  as you can see  that's the actual frame of the house. And the actual roof is made up of a fiber  which I found in my sister's old teddy bear. So I got the teddy bear and I said   Do you mind if I pull out one of your fibers   So I did. And I looked at it beneath the microscope. And some of it was flat. So I decided to slice these up with the tool that I make by    I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade. And then I actually slow down my whole nervous system. And then I work between my heartbeat  I have one and a half seconds to actually move. And at the same time I have to watch I don't inhale my own work  at the same time. Because that has happened to me. So what I did  like I said  come back to the glass. I found these little bits of glass. And I had to make them square. So I'm thinking  How can I do this   So what I did  I got an oilstone. Broke the edge of an oilstone off. And what I did  I took pieces of glass. And I started to rub them. I used a little tweezer which I made from a hair clip. And I built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn't crush the glass. And then I started rubbing  very very gently  till some of the edges were quite square. And then I constructed it. And how I constructed it  is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead. And then pushing the glass in with its own friction. And as I was doing it  what happened  The instrument that I used turned into a catapult. And it went like this ... And then that was it. Gone. So I'm thinking   Mr. Huf isn't going to be very happy when I told him his house has gone to another  into the atmosphere somewhere.  So to cut the story short  I decided that I had to go back and do it. So I found some more. And I decided to  sort of  construct it very  very slowly  holding my breath  working between my heartbeat  and making sure everything is leveled. Because it's such a small sculpture  nothing can go wrong. And I decided to build it up. Then I used fibers out of my jumper  which I held and stretched. And made the beams going around the house. And the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed. I used a money spider's web to actually attach certain things  which sent me insane. But I managed to do it. And when I finished it  I came back the next day. I noticed that the house was occupied. Have we ever heard of a dust mite  Darren dust mite and his family moved in. So basically I'd completed the house. And there you are. Right. As you can see  Bart Simpson is having a little argument. I think they're arguing about the space on the pin. There's not enough room for the two of them. So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off. I think he was just warning him actually. But this one was made out of a nylon tag out of my shirt. What I did  I plucked the tag out and put it underneath the microscope. I used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end. Can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle  Audience  No. WW  So what I did is the same process where I just kind of hold my breath and just work away very  very slowly  manipulating the plastic  cutting it  because it behaves different. Whenever you work on that level  things behave different. Because it's on this molecular level things change and they act different. And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air. And  you know  all different things happen. But I had to make a little barrier  going around it  out of cellophane  to stop it moving. Then static electricity set in. And it went ... And I'm trying to remove it. And the static is interfering with everything. So there is sweat dripping off my head  because I have to carve Homer Simpson like that  in that position. And after I've cut out the shape  then I have to make sure that there is room for Bart's neck. So after I've done the same thing  then I have to paint it. And after I've actually sculpted them  I have to paint them. I experimented with a    I found a dead fly. And I plucked the hair off the fly's head. Decided to make a paintbrush. But I would never do it to a living fly. Because I've heard a fly in pain. And they go  Meow  Ow   Even though they get on our nerves  I would never kill an insect because   All creatures great and small     there is a hymn that says that. So what I decided to do is to pluck fine hair out of my face. And I looked at it underneath the microscope. That was the paintbrush. And whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful  because the paint starts to turn into little blobs. And it starts to dry very quickly. So I have to be very quick. If I'm not  it will end up looking not like what it's supposed to look like. It could end up looking like Humpty Dumpty or somebody else. So I have to be very very careful. This one took me approximately  I would say  six to seven weeks. My work  rough estimate  sometimes five  six to seven weeks  you can't always anticipate. As you can see  that's Charlton Heston brought down to size. He says to me   Willard     You can see him saying   Why me   I says   I enjoyed your film. That's why.  As you can see  there's an aphid fly there. That's just to show the scale and the actual size of the sculpture. I would say it probably measures ... a quarter of a millimeter. In America they say a period stop. So say if you cut a period stop in half  a full stop  that's about the size of the whole thing. It's made    the chariot is made of gold. And Charlton Heston is made of a floating fiber  which I took out of the air. When the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers. And what I normally do is walk 'round a room    trying to find one. And then I put it underneath the microscope. I remember one time I was doing it  and the window was open. And there was a lady standing by the bus stop. And she saw me walking around like this. And then she looked at me. And then I went ... And then she went   Hmm  OK  he's not mad.  Yeah  to actually do this thing    the actual chariot is made of gold. I had a    karat gold ring. And I cut off a little flake of gold. And I bent it 'round  and made it into the chariot. And the horse is made from nylon. And the spider's web is for the reins on the horse. To get the symmetrical shape of the horse was very difficult  because I had to get the horse to rear up and look as though it was in some kind of action. When I did this one  a gentleman seen it and said to me   There's no way you can do this  you must have used some kind of machine. There's no way a man can do that. It must be a machine.  So I says   OK then  if you say it's a machine ...  That one took me approximately six weeks. The most famous statue in the world. This one  I would say  was a serious challenge. Because I had to put the torch on the top. That one is  more or less  the same type of process. The bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand  because I wanted to get a bit of the stone effect. I used a microscopic shard of diamond to actually carve the actual base. Well  I can look at this one and I can be very proud of this  because that statue has always sort of kept an image in my head of  you know  the beginning of people coming to America. So it's sort of Ellis Island  and seeing America for the first time. And that's the first thing they saw. So I wanted to have that little image. And this is it. And we all know that is the Hulk. I wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle. Because we know we see needles  but people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle apart from putting a thread through it. So I broke the needle. And made a needle look like the Hulk's broken it. It's    I had to make little holes in the base of the needle  to shove his feet in. So most of my work  I don't use glue. They go in with their own friction. And that's how I managed to do it. As you can see  he's looking at the moment. He's got a little grimace on his face. And his mouth must be probably about three microns. So the eyes are probably about one micron or something. That ship there  that's made from    karat gold. And I normally rig it with the web of a money spider. But I had to rig it with strands of glue. Because the web of the spider  it was sending me insane  because I couldn't get the web to move off. And that's    karat gold. And it's constructed. I built it. Constructed each plank of gold. And the whole thing is sort of symmetrical. The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold. It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right. As you can see  dressage. It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape. The actual rigging on the reins on the horse are made from the same sort of thing. And that was done with a particle from my shirt. And the pinhead I've made green around there by scraping the particles off a green shirt and then pressed onto the needle. It's very painstaking work  but the best things come in small packages. Bruno Giussani  Willard Wigan  Good morning everybody. I'd like to talk about a couple of things today. The first thing is water. Now I see you've all been enjoying the water that's been provided for you here at the conference  over the past couple of days. And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source. But what if it wasn't  What if it was from a source like this  Then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhea. I talked a lot in the past about statistics  and the provision of safe drinking water for all. But they just don't seem to get through. And I think I've worked out why. It's because  using current thinking  the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving. So we just switch off  us  governments and aid agencies. Well  today  I'd like to show you that through thinking differently  the problem has been solved. By the way  since I've been speaking  another        people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea. And four children have just died. I invented Lifesaver bottle because I got angry. I  like most of you  was sitting down  the day after Christmas in       when I was watching the devastating news of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in  playing out on TV. The days and weeks that followed  people fleeing to the hills  being forced to drink contaminated water or face death. That really stuck with me. Then  a few months later  Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.  Okay   I thought   here's a First World country  let's see what they can do.  Day one  nothing. Day two  nothing. Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome  People were shooting each other on the streets for TV sets and water. That's when I decided I had to do something. Now I spent a lot of time in my garage  over the next weeks and months  and also in my kitchen    much to the dismay of my wife.  Laughter  However  after a few failed prototypes  I finally came up with this  the Lifesaver bottle. Okay  now for the science bit. Before Lifesaver  the best hand filters were only capable of filtering down to about     nanometers. The smallest bacteria is about     nanometers. So a     nanometer bacteria is going to get through a     nanometer hole. The smallest virus  on the other hand  is about    nanometers. So that's definitely going to get through those     nanometer holes. Lifesaver pores are    nanometers. So nothing is getting through. Okay  I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration. Would you like to see that  I spent all the time setting this up  so I guess I should. We're in the fine city of Oxford. So    someone's done that up. Fine city of Oxford  so what I've done is I've gone and got some water from the River Cherwell  and the River Thames  that flow through here. And this is the water. But I got to thinking  you know  if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh  the water wouldn't look like this. So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it. And this is from my pond. Okay.  Laughs  Right. We're just going to pour that in there. Audience  Ugh  Michael Pritchard  Okay. We've got some runoff from a sewage plant farm. So I'm just going to put that in there. Put that in there. There we go. And some other bits and pieces  chuck that in there. And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit. So we're just going to put that in there as well. Okay.  Laughter  Now. The Lifesaver bottle works really simply. You just scoop the water up. Today I'm going to use a jug just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there. That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit. Okay  so I'm going to take this really filthy water  and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet  Okay. There we go. Replace the top. Give it a few pumps. Okay  That's all that's necessary. Now as soon as I pop the teat  sterile drinking water is going to come out. I've got to be quick. Okay  ready  There we go. Mind the electrics. That is safe  sterile drinking water. Cheers. There you go Chris. What's it taste of  Chris Anderson  Delicious. Michael Pritchard  Okay. Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay  Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world. It'll last for       liters. And when it's expired  using failsafe technology  the system will shut off  protecting the user. Pop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in. It's good for another       liters. So let's look at the applications. Traditionally  in a crisis  what do we do  We ship water. Then  after a few weeks  we set up camps. And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water. What happens when        people congregate in a camp  Diseases spread. More resources are required. The problem just becomes self perpetuating. But by thinking differently  and shipping these  people can stay put. They can make their own sterile drinking water  and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives. Now  it doesn't require a natural disaster for this to work. Using the old thinking  of national infrastructure and pipe work  is too expensive. When you run the numbers on a calculator  you run out of noughts. So here is the  thinking different  bit. Instead of shipping water  and using man made processes to do it  let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system. She picks the water up from there  desalinates it  for free  transports it over there  and dumps it onto the mountains  rivers  and streams. And where do people live  Near water. All we've go to do is make it sterile. How do we do that  Well  we could use the Lifesaver bottle. Or we could use one of these. The same technology  in a jerry can. This will process        liters of water  that's good enough for a family of four  for three years. And how much does it cost  About half a cent a day to run. Thank you. So  by thinking differently  and processing water at the point of use  mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water. They can get it from a source nearby. So with just eight billion dollars  we can hit the millennium goal's target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water. To put that into context  The U.K. government spends about    billion pounds a year on foreign aid. But why stop there  With    billion dollars  everyone can have access to safe drinking water. So the three and a half billion people that suffer every year as a result  and the two million kids that die every year  will live. Thank you. Take a look at this picture. It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us. These African students are doing their homework under streetlights at the airport in the capital city because they don't have any electricity at home. Now  I haven't met these particular students  but I've met students like them. Let's just pick one    for example  the one in the green shirt. Let's give him a name  too  Nelson. I'll bet Nelson has a cellphone. So here is the puzzle. Why is it that Nelson has access to a cutting edge technology  like the cellphone  but doesn't have access to a     year old technology for generating electric light in the home  Now  in a word  the answer is  rules.  Bad rules can prevent the kind of win win solution that's available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like Nelson. What kinds of rules  The electric company in this nation operates under a rule  which says that it has to sell electricity at a very low  subsidized price    in fact  a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells. So it has neither the resources  nor the incentives  to hook up many other users. The president wanted to change this rule. He's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules  rules where businesses earn a small profit  so they have an incentive to sign up more customers. That's the kind of rules that the cellphone company that Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under. The president has seen how those rules worked well. So he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity  but ran into a firestorm of protest from businesses and consumers who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates. So he was stuck with rules that prevented him from letting the win win solution help his country. And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights. The real challenge then  is to try to figure out how we can change rules. Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules  I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight that we can make practical  which is that  if we can give more choices to people  and more choices to leaders    who  in many countries  are also people. But  it's useful to present the opposition between these two. Because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader  a choice like giving the president the choice to raise prices on electricity  takes away a choice that people in the economy want. They want the choice to be able to continue consuming subsidized electric power. So if you give just to one side or the other  you'll have tension or friction. But if we can find ways to give more choices to both  that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps. Now  Nelson also has access to the Internet. And he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules  the ways that rules can keep people in the dark  look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night. In particular check out Asia. If you zoom in here  you can see North Korea  in outline here  which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors. Now  you won't be surprised to learn that the rules in North Korea keep people there in the dark. But it is important to recognize that North Korea and South Korea started out with identical sets of rules in both the sense of laws and regulations  but also in the deeper senses of understandings  norms  culture  values and beliefs. When they separated  they made choices that led to very divergent paths for their sets of rules. So we can change    we as humans can change the rules that we use to interact with each other  for better  or for worse. Now let's look at another region  the Caribbean. Zoom in on Haiti  in outline here. Haiti is also dark  compared to its neighbor here  the Dominican Republic  which has about the same number of residents. Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico  which has half as many residents as either Haiti or the Dominican Republic. What Haiti warns us is that rules can be bad because governments are weak. It's not just that the rules are bad because the government is too strong and oppressive  as in North Korea. So that if we want to create environments with good rules  we can't just tear down. We've got to find ways to build up  as well. Now  China dramatically demonstrates both the potential and the challenges of working with rules. Back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart  China was the world's high technology leader. Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel  printing  gunpowder. But the Chinese never adopted  at least in that period  effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas    a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread. And they soon adopted rules which slowed down innovation and cut China off from the rest of the world. So as other countries in the world innovated  in the sense both of developing newer technologies  but also developing newer rules  the Chinese were cut off from those advances. Income there stayed stagnant  as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world. This next chart looks at more recent data. It plots income  average income in China as a percentage of average income in the United States. In the '  s and '  s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent. But then in the late '  s something changed. Growth took off in China. The Chinese started catching up very quickly with the United States. If you go back to the map at night  you can get a clue to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China. The brightest spot in China  which you can see on the edge of the outline here  is Hong Kong. Hong Kong was a small bit of China that  for most of the   th century  operated under a very different set of rules than the rest of mainland China    rules that were copied from working market economies of the time  and administered by the British. In the     s  Hong Kong was a place where millions of people could go  from the mainland  to start in jobs like sewing shirts  making toys. But  to get on a process of increasing income  increasing skills led to very rapid growth there. Hong Kong was also the model which leaders like Deng Xiaoping could copy  when they decided to move all of the mainland towards the market model. But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people. So instead of forcing everyone in China to shift immediately to the market model  they proceeded by creating some special zones that could do  in a sense  what Britain did  make the opportunity to go work with the market rules available to the people who wanted to opt in there. So they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong  zones where Chinese could come and work  and cities grew up very rapidly there  also zones where foreign firms could come in and make things. One of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen. In that city there is a Taiwanese firm that made the iPhone that many of you have  and they made it with labor from Chinese who moved there to Shenzhen. So after the four special zones  there were    coastal cites that were open in the same sense  and eventually demonstrated successes in these places that people could opt in to  that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered. Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy. Now the Chinese example shows us several points. One is  preserve choices for people. Two  operate on the right scale. If you try to change the rules in a village  you could do that  but a village would be too small to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people all working under good rules. On the other hand  the nation is too big. If you try to change the rules in the nation  you can't give some people a chance to hold back  see how things turn out  and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules. But cities give you this opportunity to create new places  with new rules that people can opt in to. And they're large enough to get all of the benefits that we can have when millions of us work together under good rules. So the proposal is that we conceive of something called a charter city. We start with a charter that specifies all the rules required to attract the people who we'll need to build the city. We'll need to attract the investors who will build out the infrastructure    the power system  the roads  the port  the airport  the buildings. You'll need to attract firms  who will come hire the people who move there first. And you'll need to attract families  the residents who will come and live there permanently  raise their children  get an education for their children  and get their first job. With that charter  people will move there. The city can be built. And we can scale this model. We can go do it over and over again. To make it work  we need good rules. We've already discussed that. Those are captured in the charter. We also need the choices for people. That's really built into the model if we allow for the possibility of building cities on uninhabited land. You start from uninhabited territory. People can come live under the new charter  but no one is forced to live under it. The final thing we need are choices for leaders. And  to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations  cases where nations work together  in effect  de facto  the way China and Britain worked together to build  first a little enclave of the market model  and then scale it throughout China. In a sense  Britain  inadvertently  through its actions in Hong Kong  did more to reduce world poverty than all the aid programs that we've undertaken in the last century. So if we allow for these kind of partnerships to replicate this again  we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world. In some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility  a delegation of control from one country to another to take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities. Now  when I say that  some of you are starting to think   Well  is this just bringing back colonialism   It's not. But it's important to recognize that the kind of emotions that come up when we start to think about these things  can get in the way  can make us pull back  can shut down our ability  and our interest in trying to explore new ideas. Why is this not like colonialism  The thing that was bad about colonialism  and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs  is that it involved elements of coercion and condescension. This model is all about choices  both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places. And  choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension. So let's talk about how this could play out in practice. Let's take a particular leader  Raul Castro  who is the leader of Cuba. It must have occurred to Castro that he has the chance to do for Cuba what Deng Xiaoping did for China  but he doesn't have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba. He does  though  have a little bit of light down in the south that has a very special status. There is a zone there  around Guantanamo Bay  where a treaty gives the United States administrative responsibility for a piece of land that's about twice the size of Manhattan. Castro goes to the prime minister of Canada and says   Look  the Yankees have a terrible PR problem. They want to get out. Why don't you  Canada  take over  Build    run a special administrative zone. Allow a new city to be built up there. Allow many people to come in. Let us have a Hong Kong nearby. Some of my citizens will move into that city as well. Others will hold back. But this will be the gateway that will connect the modern economy and the modern world to my country.  Now  where else might this model be tried  Well  Africa. I've talked with leaders in Africa. Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule. It's a rule for changing rules. It's a way to create new rules  and let people opt in without coercion  and the opposition that coercion can force. They also totally get the idea that in some instances they can make more credible promises to long term investors    the kind of investors who will come build the port  build the roads  in a new city    they can make more credible promises if they do it along with a partner nation. Perhaps even in some arrangement that's a little bit like an escrow account  where you put land in the escrow account and the partner nation takes responsibility for it. There is also lots of land in Africa where new cities could be built. This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast. There are immense stretches of land like this    land where hundreds of millions of people could live. Now  if we generalize this and think about not just one or two charter cites  but dozens    cities that will help create places for the many hundreds of millions  perhaps billions of people who will move to cities in the coming century    is there enough land for them  Well  throughout the world  if we look at the lights at night  the one thing that's misleading is that  visually  it looks like most of the world is already built out. So let me show you why that's wrong. Take this representation of all of the land. Turn it into a square that stands for all the arable land on Earth. And let these dots represent the land that's already taken up by the cities that three billion people now live in. If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents take up only three percent of the arable land on earth. So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people  they would be dots like this. We'd go from three percent of the arable land  to four percent. We'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earth by building more cities that people can move to. And if these are cities governed by good rules  they can be cities where people are safe from crime  safe from disease and bad sanitation  where people have a chance to get a job. They can get basic utilities like electricity. Their kids can get an education. So what will it take to get started building the first charter cities  scaling this so we build many more  It would help to have a manual. What university professors could do is write some details that might go into this manual. You wouldn't want to let us run the cities  go out and design them. You wouldn't let academics out in the wild.  Laughter  But  you could set us to work thinking about questions like  suppose it isn't just Canada that does the deal with Raul Castro. Perhaps Brazil comes in as a participant  and Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to be one of the partners in a four way joint venture. How would we write the treaty to do that  There is less precedent for that  but that could easily be worked out. How would we finance this  Turns out Singapore and Hong Kong are cities that made huge gains on the value of the land that they owned when they got started. You could use the gains on the value of the land to pay for things like the police  the courts  but the school system and the health care system too  which make this a more attractive place to live  makes this a place where people have higher incomes    which  incidentally  makes the land more valuable. So the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone and build it  and set up the basic rules  go very much in the right direction. So there are many other details like this. How could we have buildings that are low cost and affordable for people who work in a first job  assembling something like an iPhone  but make those buildings energy efficient  and make sure that they are safe  so they don't fall down in an earthquake or a hurricane. Many technical details to be worked out  but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things can already tell that there is no roadblock  there's no impediment  other than a failure of imagination  that will keep us from delivering on a truly global win win solution. Let me conclude with this picture. The reason we can be so well off  even though there is so many people on earth  is because of the power of ideas. We can share ideas with other people  and when they discover them  they share with us. It's not like scarce objects  where sharing means we each get less. When we share ideas we all get more. When we think about ideas in that way  we usually think about technologies. But there is another class of ideas  the rules that govern how we interact with each other  rules like  let's have a tax system that supports a research university that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free. Let's have a system where we have ownership of land that is registered in a government office  that people can pledge as collateral. If we can keep innovating on our space of rules  and particularly innovate in the sense of coming up with rules for changing rules  so we don't get stuck with bad rules  then we can keep moving progress forward and truly make the world a better place  so that people like Nelson and his friends don't have to study any longer under the streetlights. Thank you. If I could reveal anything that is hidden from us  at least in modern cultures  it would be to reveal something that we've forgotten  that we used to know as well as we knew our own names. And that is that we live in a competent universe  that we are part of a brilliant planet  and that we are surrounded by genius. Biomimicry is a new discipline that tries to learn from those geniuses  and take advice from them  design advice. That's where I live  and it's my university as well. I'm surrounded by genius. I cannot help but remember the organisms and the ecosystems that know how to live here gracefully on this planet. This is what I would tell you to remember if you ever forget this again. Remember this. This is what happens every year. This is what keeps its promise. While we're doing bailouts  this is what happened. Spring. Imagine designing spring. Imagine that orchestration. You think TED is hard to organize.  Laughter  Right  Imagine  and if you haven't done this in a while  do. Imagine the timing  the coordination  all without top down laws  or policies  or climate change protocols. This happens every year. There is lots of showing off. There is lots of love in the air. There's lots of grand openings. And the organisms  I promise you  have all of their priorities in order. I have this neighbor that keeps me in touch with this  because he's living  usually on his back  looking up at those grasses. And one time he came up to me    he was about seven or eight years old    he came up to me. And there was a wasp's nest that I had let grow in my yard  right outside my door. And most people knock them down when they're small. But it was fascinating to me  because I was looking at this sort of fine Italian end papers. And he came up to me and he knocked. He would come every day with something to show me. And like  knock like a woodpecker on my door until I opened it up. And he asked me how I had made the house for those wasps  because he had never seen one this big. And I told him   You know  Cody  the wasps actually made that.  And we looked at it together. And I could see why he thought  you know    it was so beautifully done. It was so architectural. It was so precise. But it occurred to me  how in his small life had he already believed the myth that if something was that well done  that we must have done it. How did he not know    it's what we've all forgotten    that we're not the first ones to build. We're not the first ones to process cellulose. We're not the first ones to make paper. We're not the first ones to try to optimize packing space  or to waterproof  or to try to heat and cool a structure. We're not the first ones to build houses for our young. What's happening now  in this field called biomimicry  is that people are beginning to remember that organisms  other organisms  the rest of the natural world  are doing things very similar to what we need to do. But in fact they are doing them in a way that have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet for billions of years. So these people  biomimics  are nature's apprentices. And they're focusing on function. What I'd like to do is show you a few of the things that they're learning. They have asked themselves   What if  every time I started to invent something  I asked  'How would nature solve this '  And here is what they're learning. This is an amazing picture from a Czech photographer named Jack Hedley. This is a story about an engineer at J.R. West. They're the people who make the bullet train. It was called the bullet train because it was rounded in front  but every time it went into a tunnel it would build up a pressure wave  and then it would create like a sonic boom when it exited. So the engineer's boss said   Find a way to quiet this train.  He happened to be a birder. He went to the equivalent of an Audubon Society meeting. And he studied    there was a film about king fishers. And he thought to himself   They go from one density of medium  the air  into another density of medium  water  without a splash. Look at this picture. Without a splash  so they can see the fish. And he thought   What if we do this   Quieted the train. Made it go    percent faster on    percent less electricity. How does nature repel bacteria  We're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves from some bacteria. Turns out that    this is a Galapagos Shark. It has no bacteria on its surface  no fouling on its surface  no barnacles. And it's not because it goes fast. It actually basks. It's a slow moving shark. So how does it keep its body free of bacteria build up  It doesn't do it with a chemical. It does it  it turns out  with the same denticles that you had on Speedo bathing suits  that broke all those records in the Olympics  but it's a particular kind of pattern. And that pattern  the architecture of that pattern on its skin denticles keep bacteria from being able to land and adhere. There is a company called Sharklet Technologies that's now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals to keep bacteria from landing  which is better than dousing it with anti bacterials or harsh cleansers that many  many organisms are now becoming drug resistant. Hospital acquired infections are now killing more people every year in the United States than die from AIDS or cancer or car accidents combined    about        . This is a little critter that's in the Namibian desert. It has no fresh water that it's able to drink  but it drinks water out of fog. It's got bumps on the back of its wing covers. And those bumps act like a magnet for water. They have water loving tips  and waxy sides. And the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips. And it goes down the sides and goes into the critter's mouth. There is actually a scientist here at Oxford who studied this  Andrew Parker. And now kinetic and architectural firms like Grimshaw are starting to look at this as a way of coating buildings so that they gather water from the fog.    times better than our fog catching nets. CO  as a building block. Organisms don't think of CO  as a poison. Plants and organisms that make shells  coral  think of it as a building block. There is now a cement manufacturing company starting in the United States called Calera. They've borrowed the recipe from the coral reef  and they're using CO  as a building block in cement  in concrete. Instead of    cement usually emits a ton of CO  for every ton of cement. Now it's reversing that equation  and actually sequestering half a ton of CO  thanks to the recipe from the coral. None of these are using the organisms. They're really only using the blueprints or the recipes from the organisms. How does nature gather the sun's energy  This is a new kind of solar cell that's based on how a leaf works. It's self assembling. It can be put down on any substrate whatsoever. It's extremely inexpensive and rechargeable every five years. It's actually a company a company that I'm involved in called OneSun  with Paul Hawken. There are many many ways that nature filters water that takes salt out of water. We take water and push it against a membrane. And then we wonder why the membrane clogs and why it takes so much electricity. Nature does something much more elegant. And it's in every cell. Every red blood cell of your body right now has these hourglass shaped pores called aquaporins. They actually export water molecules through. It's kind of a forward osmosis. They export water molecules through  and leave solutes on the other side. A company called Aquaporin is starting to make desalination membranes mimicking this technology. Trees and bones are constantly reforming themselves along lines of stress. This algorithm has been put into a software program that's now being used to make bridges lightweight  to make building beams lightweight. Actually G.M. Opel used it to create that skeleton you see  in what's called their bionic car. It lightweighted that skeleton using a minimum amount of material  as an organism must  for the maximum amount of strength. This beetle  unlike this chip bag here  this beetle uses one material  chitin. And it finds many many ways to put many functions into it. It's waterproof. It's strong and resilient. It's breathable. It creates color through structure. Whereas that chip bag has about seven layers to do all of those things. One of our major inventions that we need to be able to do to come even close to what these organisms can do is to find a way to minimize the amount of material  the kind of material we use  and to add design to it. We use five polymers in the natural world to do everything that you see. In our world we use about     polymers to make all this. Nature is nano. Nanotechnology  nanoparticles  you hear a lot of worry about this. Loose nanoparticles. What is really interesting to me is that not many people have been asking   How can we consult nature about how to make nanotechnology safe   Nature has been doing that for a long time. Embedding nanoparticles in a material for instance  always. In fact  sulfur reducing bacteria  as part of their synthesis  they will emit  as a byproduct  nanoparticles into the water. But then right after that  they emit a protein that actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles so that they fall out of solution. Energy use. Organisms sip energy  because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get. And one of the largest fields right now  in the world of energy grids  you hear about the smart grid. One of the largest consultants are the social insects. Swarm technology. There is a company called Regen. They are looking at how ants and bees find their food and their flowers in the most effective way as a whole hive. And they're having appliances in your home talk to one another through that algorithm  and determine how to minimize peak power use. There's a group of scientists in Cornell that are making what they call a synthetic tree  because they are saying   There is no pump at the bottom of a tree.  It's capillary action and transpiration pulls water up  a drop at a time  pulling it  releasing it from a leaf and pulling it up through the roots. And they're creating    you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper. They're thinking about putting it on the insides of buildings to move water up without pumps. Amazon electric eel    incredibly endangered  some of these species    create     volts of electricity with the chemicals that are in your body. Even more interesting to me is that     volts doesn't fry it. You know we use PVC  and we sheath wires with PVC for insulation. These organisms  how are they insulating against their own electric charge  These are some questions that we've yet to ask. Here's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale. Humpback whale has scalloped edges on its flippers. And those scalloped edges play with flow in such a way that is reduces drag by    percent. These wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow windspeeds  as a result. MIT just has a new radio chip that uses far less power than our chips. And it's based on the cochlear of your ear  able to pick up internet  wireless  television signals and radio signals  in the same chip. Finally  on an ecosystem scale. At Biomimicry Guild  which is my consulting company  we work with HOK Architects. We're looking at building whole cities in their planning department. And what we're saying is that  shouldn't our cities do at least as well  in terms of ecosystem services  as the native systems that they replace  So we're creating something called Ecological Performance Standards that hold cities to this higher bar. The question is    biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate. The question I would ask is   What's worth solving   If you haven't seen this  it's pretty amazing. Dr. Adam Neiman. This is a depiction of all of the water on Earth in relation to the volume of the Earth    all the ice  all the fresh water  all the sea water    and all the atmosphere that we can breathe  in relation to the volume of the Earth. And inside those balls life  over  .  billion years  has made a lush  livable place for us. And we are in a long  long line of organisms to come to this planet and ask ourselves   How can we live here gracefully over the long haul   How can we do what life has learned to do  Which is to create conditions conducive to life. Now in order to do this  the design challenge of our century  I think  we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses  and to somehow meet them again. One of the big ideas  one of the big projects I've been honored to work on is a new website. And I would encourage you all to please go to it. It's called AskNature.org. And what we're trying to do  in a TEDesque way  is to organize all biological information by design and engineering function. And we're working with EOL  Encyclopedia of Life  Ed Wilson's TED wish. And he's gathering all biological information on one website. And the scientists who are contributing to EOL are answering a question   What can we learn from this organism   And that information will go into AskNature.org. And hopefully  any inventor  anywhere in the world  will be able  in the moment of creation  to type in   How does nature remove salt from water   And up will come mangroves  and sea turtles and your own kidneys. And we'll begin to be able to do as Cody does  and actually be in touch with these incredible models  these elders that have been here far  far longer than we have. And hopefully  with their help  we'll learn how to live on this Earth  and on this home that is ours  but not ours alone. Thank you very much. I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal. And I come from a long way. I've been telling a story that has been so painful for me. It's been a tough journey for me  traveling the world  telling my story in form of a book. And also telling it like now. And also  the easiest one was when I was doing it in form of a music. So I have branded myself as a war child. I'm doing this because of an old lady in my village now  who have lost her children. There is no newspaper to cover her pain  and what she wants to change in this society. And I'm doing it for a young man who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he can't write. Or there is no Internet  like Facebook  MySpace  YouTube  for them to talk. Also one thing that kept me pushing this story  this painful stories out  the dreams I have  sometimes  is like the voices of the dead  that I have seen would tell me   Don't give up. Keep on going.  Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it  because I didn't know what I was putting myself into. Well I was born in the most difficult time  when my country was at war. I saw my village burned down. The world that meant a lot to me  I saw it vanish in my face. I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five. My mother was claimed by the war. My brothers and sisters were scattered. And up to now  me and my father were detached and I still have issues with him. Seeing people die every day  my mother crying  it's like I was raised in a violence. And that made me call myself a war child. And not only that  when I was eight I became a child soldier. I didn't know what was the war for. But one thing I knew was an image that I saw that stuck in my head. When I went to the training camp I say   I want to kill as many Muslims  and as many Arabs  as possible.  The training wasn't easy  but that was the driving force  because I wanted to revenge for my family. I wanted to revenge for my village. Luckily now things have changed because I came to discover the truth. What was actually killing us wasn't the Muslims  wasn't the Arabs. It was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system  and using religion to get what they want to get out of us  which is the oil  the diamond  the gold and the land. So realizing the truth gave me a position to choose  should I continue to hate  or let it go  So I happened to forgive. Now I sing music with the Muslims. I dance with them. I even had a movie out called  War Child   funded by Muslim people. So that pain has gone out. But my story is huge. So I'm just going to go into a different step now  which is easier for me. I'm going to give you poem called  Forced to Sin   which is from my album  War Child.  I talk about my story. One of the journey that I tread when I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around    . And only    people survived that journey. So I hope you're going to hear this. My dreams are like torment. My every moment. Voices in my brain  of friends that was slain. Friends like Lual who died by my side  of starvation. In the burning jungle  and the desert plain. Next was I  but Jesus heard my cry. As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my comrade  he gave me comfort. We used to raid villages  stealing chickens  goats and sheeps  anything we could eat. I knew it was rude  but we needed food. And therefore I was forced to sin  forced to sin to make a living  forced to sin to make a living. Sometimes you gotta lose to win. Never give up. Never give in. Left home at the age of seven. One year later  live with an AK    by my side. Slept with one eye open wide. Run  duck  play dead and hide. I've seen my people die like flies. But I've never seen a dead body  at least one that I've killed. But still as I wonder  I won't go under. Guns barking like lightning and thunder. As a child so young and tender  Words I can't forget I still remember. I saw sergeant command raising his hand  no retreat  no surrender. I carry the banner of the trauma. War child  child without a mama  still fighting in the saga. Yet as I wage this new war I'm not alone in this drama. No sit or stop  as I reach for the top I'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop. I'm on a fight  day and night. Sometime I do wrong in order to make things right. It's like I'm living a dream. First time I'm feeling like a human being. Ah  The children of Darfur. Your empty bellies on the telly and now it's you that I'm fighting for. Left home. Don't even know the day I'll ever return. My country is war torn. Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns. So many people die that I don't even cry no more. Ask God question  what am I here for. And why are my people poor. And why  why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write  I was learning how to fight. I ate snails  vultures  rabbits  snakes  and anything that had life. I was ready to eat. I know it's a shame. But who is to be blamed  That's my story shared in the form of a lesson. Thank you. What energized me and kept me going is the music I do. I never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy. So the music had been my therapy for me. It's been where I actually see heaven  where I can be happy  where I can be a child again  in dances  through music. So one thing I know about music  music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system  your mind  your heart  influence your soul and your spirit  and can even influence the way you live without even you knowing. Music is the only thing that can make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg  without even wanting to do it. And so the power music has I normally compare to the power love when love doesn't see a color. You know  if you fall in love with a frog  that's it. One testimony about how I find music is powerful is when I was still a soldier back then. I hated the people in the north. But I don't know why I don't hate their music. So we party and dance to their music. And one thing that shocked me is one day they brought an Arab musician to come and entertain the soldiers. And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music. But I had this question. So now I'm doing music so I know what the power of music is. So what's happening here  I've been in a painful journey. Today is day number     in which I only eat dinner. I don't eat breakfast. No lunch. And I've done a campaign called Lose to Win. Where I'm losing so that I could win the battle that I'm fighting now. So my breakfast  my lunch  I donate it to a charity that I founded because we want to build a school in Sudan. And I'm doing this because also it's a normal thing in my home  people eat one meal a day. Here I am in the West. I choose not to. So in my village now  kids there  they normally listen to BBC  or any radio  and they are waiting to know  the day Emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school. And so I made a commitment. I say   I'm gonna not eat my breakfast.  I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month  but I've been humbled. So it's taken me     days. And I said   No stop until we get it.  And like it's been done on Facebook  MySpace. The people are giving three dollars. The lowest amount we ever got was    cents. Somebody donated    cents online. I don't know how they did it. But that moved me. And so  the importance of education to me is what I'm willing to die for. I'm willing to die for this  because I know what it can do to my people. Education enlighten your brain  give you so many chances  and you're able to survive. As a nation we have been crippled. For so many years we have fed on aid. You see a    years old     years old families in a refugee camps. They only get the food that drops from the sky  from the U.N. So these people  you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid. If anybody want to help us this is what we need. Give us tools. Give the farmers tools. It's rain. Africa is fertile. They can grow the crops. Invest in education. Education so that we have strong institution that can create a revolution to change everything. Because we have all those old men that are creating wars in Africa. They will die soon. But if you invest in education then we'll be able to change Africa. That's what I'm asking. So in order to do that  I founded a charter called Gua Africa  where we put kids in school. And now we have a couple in university. We have like    kids  ex child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support. And I said  I'm going to put it in practice.  And with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things. That's what I want to do to change  to make a difference in the world. Well now  my time is going  so I want to sing a song. But I'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a British aid worker called Emma McCune that made it possible for me to be here. I'm gonna sing this song  just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference. She came to my country and saw the importance of education. She said the only way to help Sudan is to invest in the women  educating them  educating the children  so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society. So she even ended up marrying a commander from the SPLA. And she rescued over     child soldiers. One of them happened to be me now. And so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me. Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma  Audience  Yes  Emmanuel Jal  All right.   This one goes to Emma McCune     Angel to rescue came one afternoon     I'm here because you rescued me     I'm proud to carry your legacy     Thank you. Bless you. R.I.P.     What would I be  Me      If Emma never rescued me  What would I be      What would I be  Me      Another starving refugee     What would I be      What would I be  Me      If Emma never rescued me  Yeah      Yeah  Yeah      You would have seen my face on the telly     Fat hungry belly     Flies in my eyes  head too big for my size     Just another little starving child     Running around in Africa  born to be wild     Praise God  praise the Almighty     for sending an angel to rescue me     I got a reason for being on this Earth     'Cause I know more than many what a life is worth     Now that I got a chance to stand my ground     I'm gonna run over mountains  leaps and bounds     I ain't an angel  hope I'll be one soon     And if I am  I wanna be like Emma McCune     Me  What would I be  Me      If Emma never rescued me      What would I be      What would I be  Me      Another starving refugee     What would I be      What would I be  Me      If Emma never rescued me  Yeah  Yeah     Yeah  Yeah      I would have probably died from starvation     Or some other wretched disease     I would have grown up with no education     Just another refugee     I stand here because somebody cared     I stand here because somebody dared     I know there is a lot of Emmas out there     Who is willing and trying to save a life of a child     What would I be  Me      If Emma never rescued me      What would I be      What would I be      Another starving refugee     I remember the time when I was small     When I couldn't read or write at all     Now I'm all grown up  I got my education     The sky is the limit and I can't be stopped by no one     How I prayed for this day to come     And I pray that the world find wisdom     To give the poor in need some assistance     Instead of putting up resistance  yeah     Sitting and waiting for the politics to fix this     It ain't gonna happen     They're all sitting on they asses     Popping champagne and sponging off the masses     Coming from a refugee boy soldier     But I still got my dignity     I gotta say it again     If Emma never rescued me     I'd be a corpse on the African plain   Is there anybody who's here in the back  some love. Big scream for Emma everybody. Yeah  I'm gonna get crazy now.   What would I be      If Emma never rescued me      What would I be      Another starving refugee     What would I be      If Emma never rescued me      Yeah  Yeah     Yeah  I would have probably died from starvation     Or some other wretched disease     I would have grown up with no education     Just another refugee   Thank you. Go save a life of a child. I need to make a confession at the outset here. A little over    years ago  I did something that I regret  something that I'm not particularly proud of. Something that  in many ways  I wish no one would ever know  but here I feel kind of obliged to reveal. In the late     s  in a moment of youthful indiscretion  I went to law school. In America  law is a professional degree  after your university degree  you go on to law school. When I got to law school  I didn't do very well. To put it mildly  I didn't do very well. I  in fact  graduated in the part of my law school class that made the top     possible. Thank you. I never practiced law a day in my life  I pretty much wasn't allowed to. But today  against my better judgment  against the advice of my own wife  I want to try to dust off some of those legal skills    what's left of those legal skills. I don't want to tell you a story. I want to make a case. I want to make a hard headed  evidence based  dare I say lawyerly case  for rethinking how we run our businesses. So  ladies and gentlemen of the jury  take a look at this. This is called the candle problem. Some of you might know it. It's created in      by a psychologist named Karl Duncker. He created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science. And here's how it works. Suppose I'm the experimenter. I bring you into a room. I give you a candle  some thumbtacks and some matches. And I say to you   Your job is to attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn't drip onto the table.  Now what would you do  Many people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall. Doesn't work. I saw somebody kind of make the motion over here    some people have a great idea where they light the match  melt the side of the candle  try to adhere it to the wall. It's an awesome idea. Doesn't work. And eventually  after five or ten minutes  most people figure out the solution  which you can see here. The key is to overcome what's called functional fixedness. You look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks. But it can also have this other function  as a platform for the candle. The candle problem. I want to tell you about an experiment using the candle problem  done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg  who is now at Princeton University  US  This shows the power of incentives. He gathered his participants and said   I'm going to time you  how quickly you can solve this problem.  To one group he said   I'm going to time you to establish norms  averages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem.  To the second group he offered rewards. He said   If you're in the top     of the fastest times  you get five dollars. If you're the fastest of everyone we're testing here today  you get    dollars.  Now this is several years ago  adjusted for inflation  it's a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work. It's a nice motivator. Question  How much faster did this group solve the problem  Answer  It took them  on average  three and a half minutes longer.  .  min longer. This makes no sense  right  I mean  I'm an American. I believe in free markets. That's not how it's supposed to work  right  If you want people to perform better  you reward them. Right  Bonuses  commissions  their own reality show. Incentivize them. That's how business works. But that's not happening here. You've got an incentive designed to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity  and it does just the opposite. It dulls thinking and blocks creativity. What's interesting about this experiment is that it's not an aberration. This has been replicated over and over again for nearly    years. These contingent motivators    if you do this  then you get that    work in some circumstances. But for a lot of tasks  they actually either don't work or  often  they do harm. This is one of the most robust findings in social science  and also one of the most ignored. I spent the last couple of years looking at the science of human motivation  particularly the dynamics of extrinsic motivators and intrinsic motivators. And I'm telling you  it's not even close. If you look at the science  there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does. What's alarming here is that our business operating system    think of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses  how we motivate people  how we apply our human resources   it's built entirely around these extrinsic motivators  around carrots and sticks. That's actually fine for many kinds of   th century tasks. But for   st century tasks  that mechanistic  reward and punishment approach doesn't work  often doesn't work  and often does harm. Let me show you. Glucksberg did another similar experiment  he presented the problem in a slightly different way  like this up here. Attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn't drip onto the table. Same deal. You  we're timing for norms. You  we're incentivizing. What happened this time  This time  the incentivized group kicked the other group's butt. Why  Because when the tacks are out of the box  it's pretty easy isn't it  If then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks  where there is a simple set of rules and a clear destination to go to. Rewards  by their very nature  narrow our focus  concentrate the mind  that's why they work in so many cases. So  for tasks like this  a narrow focus  where you just see the goal right there  zoom straight ahead to it  they work really well. But for the real candle problem  you don't want to be looking like this. The solution is on the periphery. You want to be looking around. That reward actually narrows our focus and restricts our possibility. Let me tell you why this is so important. In western Europe  in many parts of Asia  in North America  in Australia  white collar workers are doing less of this kind of work  and more of this kind of work. That routine  rule based  left brain work    certain kinds of accounting  financial analysis  computer programming    has become fairly easy to outsource  fairly easy to automate. Software can do it faster. Low cost providers can do it cheaper. So what really matters are the more right brained creative  conceptual kinds of abilities. Think about your own work. Think about your own work. Are the problems that you face  or even the problems we've been talking about here  do they have a clear set of rules  and a single solution  No. The rules are mystifying. The solution  if it exists at all  is surprising and not obvious. Everybody in this room is dealing with their own version of the candle problem. And for candle problems of any kind  in any field  those if then rewards  the things around which we've built so many of our businesses  don't work  It makes me crazy. And here's the thing. This is not a feeling. Okay  I'm a lawyer  I don't believe in feelings. This is not a philosophy. I'm an American  I don't believe in philosophy. This is a fact    or  as we say in my hometown of Washington  D.C.  a true fact. Let me give you an example. Let me marshal the evidence here. I'm not telling a story  I'm making a case. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury  some evidence  Dan Ariely  one of the great economists of our time  he and three colleagues did a study of some MIT students. They gave these MIT students a bunch of games  games that involved creativity  and motor skills  and concentration. And the offered them  for performance  three levels of rewards  small reward  medium reward  large reward. If you do really well you get the large reward  on down. What happened  As long as the task involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected  the higher the pay  the better the performance. Okay  But once the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill  a larger reward led to poorer performance. Then they said   Let's see if there's any cultural bias here. Let's go to Madurai  India and test it.  Standard of living is lower. In Madurai  a reward that is modest in North American standards  is more meaningful there. Same deal. A bunch of games  three levels of rewards. What happens  People offered the medium level of rewards did no better than people offered the small rewards. But this time  people offered the highest rewards  they did the worst of all. In eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments  higher incentives led to worse performance. Is this some kind of touchy feely socialist conspiracy going on here  No  these are economists from MIT  from Carnegie Mellon  from the University of Chicago. Do you know who sponsored this research  The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States. That's the American experience. Let's go across the pond to the London School of Economics  LSE  London School of Economics  alma mater of eleven Nobel Laureates in economics. Training ground for great economic thinkers like George Soros  and Friedrich Hayek  and Mick Jagger. Last month  just last month  economists at LSE looked at    studies of pay for performance plans  inside of companies. Here's what they said   We find that financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance.  There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does. And what worries me  as we stand here in the rubble of the economic collapse  is that too many organizations are making their decisions  their policies about talent and people  based on assumptions that are outdated  unexamined  and rooted more in folklore than in science. And if we really want to get out of this economic mess  if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the   st century  the solution is not to do more of the wrong things  to entice people with a sweeter carrot  or threaten them with a sharper stick. We need a whole new approach. The good news is that the scientists who've been studying motivation have given us this new approach. It's built much more around intrinsic motivation. Around the desire to do things because they matter  because we like it  they're interesting  or part of something important. And to my mind  that new operating system for our businesses revolves around three elements  autonomy  mastery and purpose. Autonomy  the urge to direct our own lives. Mastery  the desire to get better and better at something that matters. Purpose  the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves. These are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses. I want to talk today only about autonomy. In the   th century  we came up with this idea of management. Management did not emanate from nature. Management is not a tree  it's a television set. Somebody invented it. It doesn't mean it's going to work forever. Management is great. Traditional notions of management are great if you want compliance. But if you want engagement  self direction works better. Some examples of some kind of radical notions of self direction. You don't see a lot of it  but you see the first stirrings of something really interesting going on  what it means is paying people adequately and fairly  absolutely    getting the issue of money off the table  and then giving people lots of autonomy. Some examples. How many of you have heard of the company Atlassian  It looks like less than half. Atlassian is an Australian software company. And they do something incredibly cool. A few times a year they tell their engineers   Go for the next    hours and work on anything you want  as long as it's not part of your regular job. Work on anything you want.  Engineers use this time to come up with a cool patch for code  come up with an elegant hack. Then they present all of the stuff that they've developed to their teammates  to the rest of the company  in this wild and woolly all hands meeting at the end of the day. Being Australians  everybody has a beer. They call them FedEx Days. Why  Because you have to deliver something overnight. It's pretty  not bad. It's a huge trademark violation  but it's pretty clever. That one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software fixes that might never have existed. It's worked so well that Atlassian has taken it to the next level with     time    done  famously  at Google    where engineers can spend     of their time working on anything they want. They have autonomy over their time  their task  their team  their technique. Radical amounts of autonomy. And at Google  as many of you know  about half of the new products in a typical year are birthed during that     time  things like Gmail  Orkut  Google News. Let me give you an even more radical example of it  something called the Results Only Work Environment  the ROWE   created by two American consultants  in place at a dozen companies around North America. In a ROWE people don't have schedules. They show up when they want. They don't have to be in the office at a certain time  or any time. They just have to get their work done. How they do it  when they do it  where they do it  is totally up to them. Meetings in these kinds of environments are optional. What happens  Almost across the board  productivity goes up  worker engagement goes up  worker satisfaction goes up  turnover goes down. Autonomy  mastery and purpose  the building blocks of a new way of doing things. Some of you might look at this and say   Hmm  that sounds nice  but it's Utopian.  And I say   Nope. I have proof.  The mid     s  Microsoft started an encyclopedia called Encarta. They had deployed all the right incentives  They paid professionals to write and edit thousands of articles. Well compensated managers oversaw the whole thing to make sure it came in on budget and on time. A few years later  another encyclopedia got started. Different model  right  Do it for fun. No one gets paid a cent  or a euro or a yen. Do it because you like to do it. Just    years ago  if you had gone to an economist  anywhere   Hey  I've got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia. If they went head to head  who would win      years ago you could not have found a single sober economist anywhere on planet Earth who would have predicted the Wikipedia model. This is the titanic battle between these two approaches. This is the Ali Frazier of motivation  right  This is the Thrilla in Manila. Intrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators. Autonomy  mastery and purpose  versus carrot and sticks  and who wins  Intrinsic motivation  autonomy  mastery and purpose  in a knockout. Let me wrap up. There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does. Here is what science knows. One  Those   th century rewards  those motivators we think are a natural part of business  do work  but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances. Two  Those if then rewards often destroy creativity. Three  The secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments  but that unseen intrinsic drive   the drive to do things for their own sake. The drive to do things cause they matter. And here's the best part. We already know this. The science confirms what we know in our hearts. So  if we repair this mismatch between science and business  if we bring our motivation  notions of motivation into the   st century  if we get past this lazy  dangerous  ideology of carrots and sticks  we can strengthen our businesses  we can solve a lot of those candle problems  and maybe  maybe    we can change the world. I rest my case. Early visions of wireless power actually were thought of by Nikola Tesla basically about     years ago. The thought that you wouldn't want to transfer electric power wirelessly  no one ever thought of that. They thought   Who would use it if you didn't   And so  in fact  he actually set about doing a variety of things. Built the Tesla coil. This tower was built on Long Island back at the beginning of the     s. And the idea was  it was supposed to be able to transfer power anywhere on Earth. We'll never know if this stuff worked. Actually  I think the Federal Bureau of Investigation took it down for security purposes  sometime in the early     s. But the one thing that did come out of electricity is that we love this stuff so much. I mean  think about how much we love this. If you just walk outside  there are trillions of dollars that have been invested in infrastructure around the world  putting up wires to get power from where it's created to where it's used. The other thing is  we love batteries. And for those of us that have an environmental element to us  there is something like    billion disposable batteries built every year for power that  generally speaking  is used within a few inches or a few feet of where there is very inexpensive power. So  before I got here  I thought   You know  I am from North America. We do have a little bit of a reputation in the United States.  So I thought I'd better look it up first. So definition number six is the North American definition of the word  suck.  Wires suck  they really do. Think about it. Whether that's you in that picture or something under your desk. The other thing is  batteries suck too. And they really  really do. Do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff     billion of these things built. This is what happens. They fall apart  they disintegrate  and they end up here. So when you talk about expensive power  the cost per kilowatt hour to supply battery power to something is on the order of two to three hundred pounds. Think about that. The most expensive grid power in the world is thousandths of that. So fortunately  one of the other definitions of  suck  that was in there  it does create a vacuum. And nature really does abhor a vacuum. What happened back a few years ago was a group of theoretical physicists at MIT actually came up with this concept of transferring power over distance. Basically they were able to light a    watt light bulb at a distance of about two meters. It got about    percent of the efficiency    by the way  that's still a couple thousand times more efficient than a battery would be  to do the same thing. But were able to light that  and do it very successfully. This was actually the experiment. So you can see the coils were somewhat larger. The light bulb was a fairly simple task  from their standpoint. This all came from a professor waking up at night to the third night in a row that his wife's cellphone was beeping because it was running out of battery power. And he was thinking   With all the electricity that's out there in the walls  why couldn't some of that just come into the phone so I could get some sleep   And he actually came up with this concept of resonant energy transfer. But inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire. And those two coils of wire are really  really close to each other  and actually do transfer power magnetically and wirelessly  only over a very short distance. What Dr. Soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology  which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room. It's a resonant phenomenon for which he actually received a MacArthur Fellowship Award  which is nicknamed the Genius Award  last September  for his discovery. So how does it work  Imagine a coil. For those of you that are engineers  there's a capacitor attached to it too. And if you can cause that coil to resonate  what will happen is it will pulse at alternating current frequencies    at a fairly high frequency  by the way. And if you can bring another device close enough to the source  that will only work at exactly that frequency  you can actually get them to do what's called strongly couple  and transfer magnetic energy between them. And then what you do is  you start out with electricity  turn it into magnetic field  take that magnetic field  turn it back into electricity  and then you can use it. Number one question I get asked. I mean  people are worried about cellphones being safe. You know. What about safety  The first thing is this is not a  radiative  technology. It doesn't radiate. There aren't electric fields here. It's a magnetic field. It stays within either what we call the source  or within the device. And actually  the magnetic fields we're using are basically about the same as the Earth's magnetic field. We live in a magnetic field. And the other thing that's pretty cool about the technology is that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency. And it's virtually impossible in nature to make that happen. Then finally we have governmental bodies everywhere that will regulate everything we do. They've pretty much set field exposure limits  which all of the things in the stuff I'll show you today sort of sit underneath those guidelines. Mobile electronics. Home electronics. Those cords under your desk  I bet everybody here has something that looks like that or those batteries. There are industrial applications. And then finally  electric vehicles. These electric cars are beautiful. But who is going to want to plug them in  Imagine driving into your garage    we've built a system to do this    you drive into your garage  and the car charges itself  because there is a mat on the floor that's plugged into the wall. And it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently. Then there's all kinds of other applications. Implanted medical devices  where people don't have to die of infections anymore if you can seal the thing up. Credit cards  robot vacuum cleaners. So what I'd like to do is take a couple minutes and show you  actually  how it works. And what I'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here. You've got a coil. That coil is connected to an R.F. amplifier that creates a high frequency oscillating magnetic field. We put one on the back of the television set. By the way  I do make it look a little bit easier than it is. There's lots of electronics and secret sauce and all kinds of intellectual property that go into it. But then what's going to happen is  it will create a field. It will cause one to get created on the other side. And if the demo gods are willing  in about    seconds or so we should see it. The    seconds actually are because we    I don't know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a T.V. in when you use just a cord. Generally  you have to go over and hit the button. So I thought we put a little computer in it that has to wake up to tell it to do that. So  I'll plug that in. It creates a magnetic field here. It causes one to be created out here. And as I said  in sort of about    seconds we should start to see ... This is a commercially    available color television set. Imagine  you get one of these things. You want to hang them on the wall. How many people want to hang them on the wall  Think about it. You don't want those ugly cords coming down. Imagine if you can get rid of it. The other thing I wanted to talk about was safety. So  there is nothing going on. I'm okay. And I'll do it again  just for safety's sake. Almost immediately  though  people ask   How small can you make this  Can you make this small enough   Because remember Dr. Soljacic's original idea was his wife's cellphone beeping. So  I wanted to show you something. We're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing. This a Google G . You know  it's the latest thing that's come out. It runs the Android operating system. I think I heard somebody talk about that before. It's odd. It has a battery. It also has coiled electronics that WiTricity has put into the back of it. And if I can get the camera    okay  great    you'll see  as I get sort of close... you're looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly. And I know some of you are Apple aficionados. So  you know they don't make it easy at Apple to get inside their phones. So we put a little sleeve on the back  but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too. And those of you that have an iPhone recognize the green center. And Nokia as well. You'll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back  to do that  and it probably beeps  actually  as it goes on as well. But they typically use it to light up the screen. So  imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling. They could go in the floor. They could go  actually  underneath your desktop. So that when you walk in or you come in from home  if you carry a purse  it works in your purse. You never have to worry about plugging these things in again. And think of what that would do for you. So I think in closing  sort of in the immortal visions of The New Yorker magazine  I thought I'd put up one more slide. And for those of you who can't read it  it says   It does appear to be some kind of wireless technology.  So  thank you very much. I'm going to talk about your mindset. Does your mindset correspond to my dataset  If not  one or the other needs upgrading  isn't it  When I talk to my students about global issues  and I listen to them in the coffee break  they always talk about  we  and  them.  And when they come back into the lecture room I ask them   What do you mean with  we  and  them    Oh  it's very easy. It's the western world and it's the developing world   they say.  We learned it in college.  And what is the definition then   The definition  Everyone knows   they say. But then you know  I press them like this. So one girl said  very cleverly   It's very easy. Western world is a long life in a small family. Developing world is a short life in a large family.  And I like that definition  because it enabled me to transfer their mindset into the dataset. And here you have the dataset. So  you can see that what we have on this axis here is size of family. One  two  three  four  five children per woman on this axis. And here  length of life  life expectancy            . Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world. And really this is about the bedroom. Whether the man and woman decide to have small family  and take care of their kids  and how long they will live. It's about the bathroom and the kitchen. If you have soap  water and food  you know  you can live long. And the students were right. It wasn't that the world consisted    the world consisted here  of one set of countries over here  which had large families and short life. Developing world. And we had one set of countries up there which was the western world. They had small families and long life. And you are going to see here the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime. Then the developing countries applied soap and water  vaccination. And all the developing world started to apply family planning. And partly to USA who help to provide technical advice and investment. And you see all the world moves over to a two child family  and a life with    to    years. But some countries remain back in this area here. And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here. We have Liberia. We have Congo. So we have countries living there. So the problem I had is that the worldview that my students had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born. And we  in fact  when we have played this over the world. I was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week  and I could see the wrong concept even active people in United States had  that they didn't realize the improvement of Mexico there  and China  in relation to United States. Look here when I move them forward. Here we go. They catch up. There's Mexico. It's on par with United States in these two social dimensions. There was less than five percent of the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this. This great nation  Mexico  has the problem that arms are coming from North  across the borders  so they had to stop that  because they have this strange relationship to the United States  you know. But if I would change this axis here  I would instead put income per person. Income per person. I can put that here. And we will then see a completely different picture. By the way  I'm teaching you how to use our website  Gapminder World  while I'm correcting this  because this is a free utility on the net. And when I now finally got it right  I can go back     years in history. And I can find United States up there. And I can let the other countries be shown. And now I have income per person on this axis. And United States only had some  one  two thousand dollars at that time. And the life expectancy was    to    years  on par with Afghanistan today. And what has happened in the world  I will show now. This is instead of studying history for one year at university. You can watch me for one minute now and you'll see the whole thing. You can see how the brown bubbles  which is west Europe  and the yellow one  which is the United States  they get richer and richer and also start to get healthier and healthier. And this is now     years ago  where the rest of the world remains behind. Here we come. And that was the influenza. That's why we are so scared about flu  isn't it  It's still remembered. The fall of life expectancy. And then we come up. Not until independence started. Look here You have China over there  you have India over there  and this is what has happened. Did you note there  that we have Mexico up there  Mexico is not at all on par with the United States  but they are quite close. And especially  it's interesting to see China and the United States during     years  because I have my oldest son now working for Google  after Google acquired this software. Because in fact  this is child labor. My son and his wife sat in a closet for many years and developed this. And my youngest son  who studied Chinese in Beijing. So they come in with the two perspectives I have  you know  And my son  youngest son who studied in Beijing  in China  he got a long term perspective. Whereas when my oldest son  who works for Google  he should develop by quarter  or by half year. Or Google is quite generous  so he can have one or two years to go. But in China they look generation after generation because they remember the very embarrassing period  for     years  when they went backwards. And then they would remember the first part of last century  which was really bad  and we could go by this so called Great Leap Forward. But this was     . Mao Tse Tung eventually brought health to China  and then he died  and then Deng Xiaoping started this amazing move forward. Isn't it strange to see that the United States first grew the economy  and then gradually got rich  Whereas China could get healthy much earlier  because they applied the knowledge of education  nutrition  and then also benefits of penicillin and vaccines and family planning. And Asia could have social development before they got the economic development. So to me  as a public health professor  it's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now. Because what you see here  what you see here is the flat world of Thomas Friedman  isn't it. It's not really  really flat. But the middle income countries    and this is where I suggest to my students  stop using the concept  developing world.  Because after all  talking about the developing world is like having two chapters in the history of the United States. The last chapter is about present  and president Obama  and the other is about the past  where you cover everything from Washington to Eisenhower. Because Washington to Eisenhower  that is what we find in the developing world. We could actually go to Mayflower to Eisenhower  and that would be put together into a developing world  which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way  which have great entrepreneurs  but also have the collapsing countries. So  how could we make better sense about this  Well  one way of trying is to see whether we could look at income distribution. This is the income distribution of peoples in the world  from   . This is where you have food to eat. These people go to bed hungry. And this is the number of people. This is      whether you have a public or a private health service system. This is where you can provide health service for your family and school for your children  and this is OECD countries  Green  Latin America  East Europe. This is East Asia  and the light blue there is South Asia. And this is how the world changed. It changed like this. Can you see how it's growing  And how hundreds of millions and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia  And it goes over here  And I come now  into projections  but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there  you know  because    that's where the projections are not valid any longer. Probably the world will do this. and then it will continue forward like this. But more or less  this is what will happen  and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided. We have the high income countries here  with the United States as a leading power  we have the emerging economies in the middle  which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout  and we have the low income countries here. Yeah  this is a fact that from where the money comes  they have been saving  you know  over the last decade. And here we have the low income countries where entrepreneurs are. And here we have the countries in collapse and war  like Afghanistan  Somalia  parts of Congo  Darfur. We have all this at the same time. That's why it's so problematic to describe what has happened in the developing world. Because it's so different  what has happened there. And that's why I suggest a slightly different approach of what you would call it. And you have huge differences within countries also. I heard that your departments here were by regions. Here you have Sub Saharan Africa  South Asia  East Asia  Arab states  East Europe  Latin America  and OECD. And on this axis  GDP. And on this  heath  child survival  and it doesn't come as a surprise that Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom. But when I split it  when I split it into country bubbles  the size of the bubbles here is the population. Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius  completely different. There is such a difference within Sub Saharan Africa. And I can split the others. Here is the South Asian  Arab world. Now all your different departments. East Europe  Latin America  and OECD countries. And here were are. We have a continuum in the world. We cannot put it into two parts. It is Mayflower down here. It is Washington here  building  building countries. It's Lincoln here  advancing them. It's Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries. And then it's United States today  up here. And we have countries all this way. Now  this is the important thing of understanding how the world has changed. At this point I decided to make a pause. And it is my task  on behalf of the rest of the world  to convey a thanks to the U.S. taxpayers  for Demographic Health Survey. Many are not aware of    no  this is not a joke. This is very serious. It is due to USA's continuous sponsoring during    years of the very good methodology for measuring child mortality that we have a grasp of what's happening in the world. And it is U.S. government at its best  without advocacy  providing facts  that it's useful for the society. And providing data free of charge on the internet  for the world to use. Thank you very much. Quite the opposite of the World Bank  who compiled data with government money  tax money  and then they sell it to add a little profit  in a very inefficient  Gutenberg way. But the people doing that at the World Bank are among the best in the world. And they are highly skilled professionals. It's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies to deal with the world in the modern way  as we do. And when it comes to free data and transparency  United States of America is one of the best. And that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor. And I'm not paid to come here  no. I would like to show you what happens with the data  what we can show with this data. Look here. This is the world. With income down there and child mortality. And what has happened in the world  Since       during the last    years we have had a fall in child mortality. And it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this. And we had an increase in income. And the blue former developing countries are mixing up with the former industrialized western world. We have a continuum. But we still have  of course  Congo  up there. We still have as poor countries as we have had  always  in history. And that's the bottom billion  where we've heard today about a completely new approach to do it. And how fast has this happened  Well  MDG  . The United States has not been so eager to use MDG  . But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it  because it's the only child mortality that we can measure. And we used to say that it should fall four percent per year. Let's see what Sweden has done. We used to boast about fast social progress. That's where we were      .       Sweden was there. Same child mortality as Bangladesh had        though they had lower income. They started very well. They used the aid well. They vaccinated the kids. They get better water. And they reduced child mortality  with an amazing  .  percent per year. They beat Sweden. I run Sweden the same    year period. Second round  it's Sweden        against Egypt      . Here we go. Once again the USA is part of the reason here. They get safe water  they get food for the poor  and they get malaria eradicated.  .  percent. They are faster than the millennium development goal. And third chance for Sweden  against Brazil here. Brazil here has amazing social improvement over the last    years  and they go faster than Sweden. This means that the world is converging. The middle income countries  the emerging economy  they are catching up. They are moving to cities  where they also get better assistance for that. Well the Swedish students protest at this point. They say   This is not fair  because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics that were not available for Sweden. We have to do real time competition.  Okay. I give you Singapore  the year I was born. Singapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden. It's the most tropical country in the world  a marshland on the equator. And here we go. It took a little time for them to get independent. But then they started to grow their economy. And they made the social investment. They got away malaria. They got a magnificent health system that beat both the U.S. and Sweden. We never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden  All these green countries are achieving millennium development goals. These yellow are just about to be doing this. These red are the countries that doesn't do it  and the policy has to be improved. Not simplistic extrapolation. We have to really find a way of supporting those countries in a better way. We have to respect the middle income countries on what they are doing. And we have to fact base the whole way we look at the world. This is dollar per person. This is HIV in the countries. The blue is Africa. The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected. You see the tragedy in South Africa there. About    percent of the adult population are infected. And in spite of them having quite a high income  they have a huge number of HIV infected. But you also see that there are African countries down here. There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa. There's a number  five to    countries in Africa that has the same level as Sweden and United States. And there are others who are extremely high. And I will show you that what has happened in one of the best countries  with the most vibrant economy in Africa and a good governance  Botswana. They have a very high level. It's coming down. But now it's not falling  because there  with help from PEPFAR  it's working with treatment. And people are not dying. And you can see it's not that easy  that it is war which caused this. Because here  in Congo  there is war. And here  in Zambia  there is peace. And it's not the economy. Richer country has a little higher. If I split Tanzania in its income  the richer    percent in Tanzania has more HIV than the poorest one. And it's really different within each country. Look at the provinces of Kenya. They are very different. And this is the situation you see. It's not deep poverty. It's the special situation  probably of concurrent sexual partnership among part of the heterosexual population in some countries  or some parts of countries  in south and eastern Africa. Don't make it Africa. Don't make it a race issue. Make it a local issue. And do prevention at each place  in the way it can be done there. So to just end up  there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest  which we don't know. Those who live beyond the cellphone  those who have yet to see a computer  those who have no electricity at home. This is the disease  Konzo  I spent    years elucidating in Africa. It's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation. It's similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the '  s. It's similar to other nutritional diseases. It will never affect a rich person. We have seen it here in Mozambique. This is the epidemic in Mozambique. This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania. You never heard about the disease. But it's much more than Ebola that has been affected by this disease. Cause crippling throughout the world. And over the last two years        people has been crippled in the southern tip of Bandundu region. That used to be the illegal diamond trade  from the UNITA dominated area in Angola. That has now disappeared  and they are now in great economic problem. And one week ago  for the first time  there were four lines on the Internet. Don't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in peaceful low income countries. There is still mystery in one billion. And we have to have more concepts than just developing countries and developing world. We need a new mindset. The world is converging  but    but    but not the bottom billion. They are still as poor as they've ever been. It's not sustainable  and it will not happen around one superpower. But you will remain one of the most important superpowers  and the most hopeful superpower  for the time to be. And this institution will have a very crucial role  not for United States  but for the world. So you have a very bad name  State Department. This is not the State Department. It's the World Department. And we have a high hope in you. Thank you very much. I love theater. I love the idea that you can transform  become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective. I love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen. The idea that in that room at that moment  everyone  regardless of their age  their gender  their race  their color  their religion  comes together. At that moment  we transcend space and time together. Theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination. And our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers. Our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique. I was commissioned in      to create an original show  and began developing  Upwake.   Upwake  tells the story of Zero  a modern day business man  going to work with his life in a suitcase  stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two. I wanted  Upwake  to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would. And I wanted to let my imagination run wild. So I began drawing the story that was moving in my head. If Antoine de Saint Exupery  the author of  The Little Prince   were here  he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you your sheep was inside. Because  if you look closely enough  things will begin to appear. This is not a box  these are the renderings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life. In  Upwake  buildings wear suits  Zero tap dances on a giant keyboard  clones himself with a scanner  tames and whips the computer mice  sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space. I wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist. Go from one world to another in a second. I wanted to have humor  beauty  simplicity and complexity and use metaphors to suggest ideas. At the beginning of the show  for example  Zero deejays dream and reality. Technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions in high definition  live  on stage. So today  I would like to talk to you about the relationship between theater and technology. Let's start with technology. All right. Let's start with theater. Thank you.  Upwake  lasts    minutes and    seconds. I project  D animation on all the four surfaces of the stage which I interact with. The use of animation and projection was a process of discovery. I didn't use it as a special effect  but as a partner on stage. There are no special effects in  Upwake   no artifice. It's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal. Three hundred and forty four frames  four and a half years and commissions later  what started as a one person show became a collaborative work of nineteen most talented artists. And here are some excerpts. Thank you. So this is  relatively  a new show that we're now beginning to tour. And in Austin  Texas  I was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon. When I arrived at one of the schools  I certainly did not expect this  Six hundred kids  packed in a gymnasium  waiting. I was a little nervous performing without animation  costume    really    and make up. But the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn't seen the kids that attentive. And I think the reason why is that I was able to use their language and their reality in order to transport them into another. Something happened along the way. Zero became a person and not just a character in a play. Zero does not speak  is neither man nor woman. Zero is Zero  a little hero of the   st Century  and Zero can touch so many more people than I possibly could. It's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box as it is about taking theater out of its box. As a street performer  I have learned that everybody wants to connect. And that usually  if you're a bit extraordinary  if you're not exactly of human appearance  then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud. It's as though you made something resonate within them. It's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more. Because through your mask  they let theirs go. Being human is an art form. I know theater can improve the quality of people's lives  and I know theater can heal. I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years. I have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors be lifted and transported in moments of pure joy. I know theater unites us. Zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow  tell various stories through different mediums. Comic books. Quantum physics video games. And Zero wants to go to the moon. In       Zero launched a green campaign  suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity every Sunday from      to      p.m. The idea is simple  basic. It's not original  but it's important  and it's important to participate. There is a revolution. It's a human and technological revolution. It's motion and emotion. It's information. It's visual. It's musical. It's sensorial. It's conceptual. It's universal. It's beyond words and numbers. It's happening. The natural progression of science and art finding each other to better touch and define the human experience. There is a revolution in the way that we think  in the way that we share  and the way that we express our stories  our evolution. This is a time of communication  connection and creative collaboration. Charlie Chaplin innovated motion pictures and told stories through music  silence  humor and poetry. He was social  and his character  The Tramp  spoke to millions. He gave entertainment  pleasure and relief to so many human beings when they needed it the most. We are not here to question the possible  we are here to challenge the impossible. In the science of today  we become artists. In the art of today  we become scientists. We design our world. We invent possibilities. We teach  touch and move. It is now that we can use the diversity of our talents to create intelligent  meaningful and extraordinary work. It's now. Thank you. I've been fascinated with crop diversity for about    years from now  ever since I stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article by a guy named Jack Harlan. And he described the diversity within crops    all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such    as a genetic resource. And he said   This genetic resource      and I'll never forget the words     stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine.  I figured he was either really on to something  or he was one of these academic nutcases. So  I looked a little further  and what I figured out was that he wasn't a nutcase. He was the most respected scientist in the field. What he understood was that biological diversity    crop diversity    is the biological foundation of agriculture. It's the raw material  the stuff  of evolution in our agricultural crops. Not a trivial matter. And he also understood that that foundation was crumbling  literally crumbling. That indeed  a mass extinction was underway in our fields  in our agricultural system. And that this mass extinction was taking place with very few people noticing and even fewer caring. Now  I know that many of you don't stop to think about diversity in agricultural systems and  let's face it  that's logical. You don't see it in the newspaper every day. And when you go into the supermarket  you certainly don't see a lot of choices there. You see apples that are red  yellow  and green and that's about it. So  let me show you a picture of one form of diversity. Here's some beans  and there are about    or    different varieties of beans on this picture. Now  imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poodle from a Great Dane. If I wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world  and I put    or    of them on a slide  it would take about    slides because there about     breeds of dogs in the world. But there are    to        different varieties of beans. So if I were to going to show you all the beans in the world  and I had a slide like this  and I switched it every second  it would take up my entire TED talk  and I wouldn't have to say anything. But the interesting thing is that this diversity    and the tragic thing is    that this diversity is being lost. We have about         different varieties of wheat  and we have about   to         different varieties of rice  but it's being lost. And I want to give you an example of that. It's a bit of a personal example  in fact. In the United States  in the     s    that's where we have the best data    farmers and gardeners were growing       named varieties of apples. Imagine that.       apples with names. Today        of those are extinct  no longer to be seen again. I used to have a list of these extinct apples  and when I would go out and give a presentation  I would pass the list out in the audience. I wouldn't tell them what it was  but it was in alphabetical order  and I would tell them to look for their names  their family names  their mother's maiden name. And at the end of the speech  I would ask   How many people have found a name   And I never had fewer than two thirds of an audience hold up their hand. And I said   You know what  These apples come from your ancestors  and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them. They gave them their name. The bad news is they're extinct. The good news is a third of you didn't hold up your hand. Your apple's still out there. Find it. Make sure it doesn't join the list.  So  I want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the Fowler apple is still out there. And there's an old book back here  and I want to read a piece from it. This book was published in     . It's called  The Apples of New York  and this is the second volume. See  we used to have a lot of apples. And the Fowler apple is described in here    I hope this doesn't surprise you    as   a beautiful fruit.  I don't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us  but ... but  to be honest  the description goes on and it says that it  doesn't rank high in quality  however.  And then he has to go even further. It sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine.  As grown in New York  the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality and is  on the whole  unsatisfactory.  And I guess there's a lesson to be learned here  and the lesson is  so why save it  I get this question all the time. Why don't we just save the best one  And there are a couple of answers to that question. One thing is that there is no such thing as a best one. Today's best variety is tomorrow's lunch for insects or pests or disease. The other thing is that maybe that Fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that's not economical right now has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we're going to need for climate change that the others don't. So it's not necessary  thank God  that the Fowler apple is the best apple in the world. It's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good  unique trait. And for that reason  we ought to be saving it. Why  As a raw material  as a trait we can use in the future. Think of diversity as giving us options. And options  of course  are exactly what we need in an era of climate change. I want to show you two slides  but first  I want to tell you that we've been working at the Global Crop Diversity Trust with a number of scientists    particularly at Stanford and University of Washington    to ask the question  What's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops to be able to adapt to this  In short  the answer is that in the future  in many countries  the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past. The coldest growing seasons of the future  hotter than the hottest of the past. Is agriculture adapted to that  I don't know. Can fish play the piano  If agriculture hasn't experienced that  how could it be adapted  Now  the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world  and the place where climate change  ironically  is going to be the worst is in South Asia and sub Saharan Africa. So I've picked two examples here  and I want to show you. In the histogram before you now  the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures  going back about far as we have temperature data. And you can see that there's some difference between one growing season and another. Some are colder  some are hotter and it's a bell shaped curve. The tallest bar is the average temperature for the most number of growing seasons. In the future  later this century  it's going to look like the red  totally out of bounds. The agricultural system and  more importantly  the crops in the field in India have never experienced this before. Here's South Africa. The same story. But the most interesting thing about South Africa is we don't have to wait for      for there to be trouble. By       if the maize  or corn  varieties  which is the dominant crop       percent of the nutrition in Southern Africa are still in the field    in       we'll have a    percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in     .    percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population  that's a food crisis. It's global in nature. We will watch children starve to death on TV. Now  you may say that    years is a long way off. It's two breeding cycles for maize. We have two rolls of the dice to get this right. We have to get climate ready crops in the field  and we have to do that rather quickly. Now  the good news is that we have conserved. We have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity  agricultural diversity  mostly in the form of seed  and we put it in seed banks  which is a fancy way of saying a freezer. If you want to conserve seed for a long term and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers  you dry it and then you freeze it. Unfortunately  these seed banks are located around the world in buildings and they're vulnerable. Disasters have happened. In recent years we lost the gene bank  the seed bank in Iraq and Afghanistan. You can guess why. In Rwanda  in the Solomon Islands. And then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings  financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures  and all kinds of things  and every time something like this happens  it means extinction. We lose diversity. And I'm not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys. I'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs  actually losing it  never to be seen again. So  a number of us got together and decided that  you know  enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of    maybe not the most charismatic diversity. You don't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear  but it's very important diversity. So we needed a really safe place  and we went quite far north to find it. To Svalbard  in fact. This is above mainland Norway. You can see Greenland there. That's at    degrees north. It's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane. It's a remarkably beautiful landscape. I can't even begin to describe it to you. It's otherworldly  beautiful. We worked with the Norwegian government and with the NorGen  the Norwegian Genetic Resources Program  to design this facility. What you see is an artist's conception of this facility  which is built in a mountain in Svalbard. The idea of Svalbard was that it's cold  so we get natural freezing temperatures. But it's remote. It's remote and accessible so it's safe and we don't depend on mechanical refrigeration. This is more than just an artist's dream  it's now a reality. And this next picture shows it in context  in Svalbard. And here's the front door of this facility. When you open up the front door  this is what you're looking at. It's pretty simple. It's a hole in the ground. It's a tunnel  and you go into the tunnel  chiseled in solid rock  about     meters. There are now a couple of security doors  so you won't see it quite like this. Again  when you get to the back  you get into an area that's really my favorite place. I think of it as sort of a cathedral. And I know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd  but ... Some of the happiest days of my life have been spent ... in this place there. If you were to walk into one of these rooms  you would see this. It's not very exciting  but if you know what's there  it's pretty emotional. We have now about         samples of unique crop varieties. There's        samples of different varieties of rice in this facility right now. About a year from now  we'll have over half a million samples. We're going up to over a million  and someday we'll basically have samples    about     seeds    of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state in this facility. This is a backup system for world agriculture. It's a backup system for all the seed banks. Storage is free. It operates like a safety deposit box. Norway owns the mountain and the facility  but the depositors own the seed. And if anything happens  then they can come back and get it. This particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the United States  of Canada  and an international institution from Syria. I think it's interesting in that this facility  I think  is almost the only thing I can think of these days where countries  literally  every country in the world    because we have seeds from every country in the world    all the countries of the world have gotten together to do something that's both long term  sustainable and positive. I can't think of anything else that's happened in my lifetime that way. I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a solution for climate change  for the water crisis. Agriculture takes    percent of fresh water supplies on earth. I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution for those things  or the energy crisis  or world hunger  or peace in conflict. I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a simple solution for that  but I can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems if we don't have crop diversity. Because I challenge you to think of an effective  efficient  sustainable solution to climate change if we don't have crop diversity. Because  quite literally  if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change  neither will we. And if crops don't adapt to climate change  neither will agriculture  neither will we. So  this is not something pretty and nice to do. There are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist just for the existence value of it. It is  I agree  a nice thing to do. But it's a necessary thing to do. So  in a very real sense  I believe that we  as an international community  should get organized to complete the task. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a wonderful gift that Norway and others have given us  but it's not the complete answer. We need to collect the remaining diversity that's out there. We need to put it into good seed banks that can offer those seeds to researchers in the future. We need to catalog it. It's a library of life  but right now I would say we don't have a card catalog for it. And we need to support it financially. My big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university  we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat.    million dollars in an endowment would take care of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever. So we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms. And my final thought is that we  of course  by conserving wheat  rice  potatoes  and the other crops  we may  quite simply  end up saving ourselves. Thank you. I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems and how it can be solved. I'd like to start with a little experiment. Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses  or you've had laser refractive surgery  Now  unfortunately  there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly. But it looks like    I'm guessing    that it'll be about    percent of the room because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction. The World Health Organization estimates    well  they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses    the lowest estimate is     million people. They also have an estimate of around a billion. But in fact  I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now  which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population. And the problem of poor vision  is actually not just a health problem  it's also an educational problem  and it's an economic problem  and it's a quality of life problem. Glasses are not very expensive. They're quite plentiful. The problem is  there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world. There are just way too few eye care professionals. So this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about        people and that's the ratio in the U.K. This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub Saharan Africa. In fact  there are some countries in sub Saharan Africa where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population. How do you do this  How do you solve this problem  I came up with a solution to this problem  and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this. And the idea is you make eye glasses  and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem. What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses. I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket. I'm short sighted. I look at the signs at the end  I can hardly see them. So    okay  I can now see that man running out there  and I can see that guy running out there. I've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription. Next step in my process. So  I've now made eye glasses to my prescription. Okay  so I've made these glasses and ... Okay  I've made the glasses to my prescription and ... ... I've just ... And I've now made some glasses. That's it. Now  these aren't the only pair in the world. In fact  this technology's been evolving. I started working on it in       and it's been evolving very slowly. There are about        in use now. And they're in fifteen countries. They're spread around the world. And I have a vision  which I'll share with you. I have a global vision for vision. And that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year     . To do that    this is an early example of the technology. The technology is being further developed    the cost has to be brought down. This pair  in fact  these currently cost about    dollars. But the cost has to be brought right down. It has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day. How do you solve this problem  You start to get into detail. And on this slide  I'm basically explaining all the problems you have. How do you distribute  How do you work out how to fit the thing  How do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem  How do you deal with the industry  And the answer to that is research. What we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World here in the university. If you want to know more  just come have a look at our website. Thank you. It's hard to believe that it's less than a year since the extraordinary moment when the finance  the credit  which drives our economies froze. A massive cardiac arrest. The effect  the payback  perhaps  for years of vampire predators like Bernie Madoff  whom we saw earlier. Abuse of steroids  binging and so on. And it's only a few months since governments injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat. And we're now in a very strange sort of twilight zone  where no one quite knows what's worked  or what doesn't. We don't have any very clear maps  any compass to guide us. We don't know which experts to believe anymore. What I'm going to try and do is to give some pointers to what I think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis  what things we should be looking out for and how we can actually use the crisis. There's a definition of leadership which says   It's the ability to use the smallest possible crisis for the biggest possible effect.  And I want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis  which is by no means small  really is used to the full. I want to start just by saying a bit about where I'm coming from. I've got a very confused background which perhaps makes me appropriate for confused times. I've got a Ph.D. in Telecoms  as you can see. I trained briefly as a Buddhist monk under this guy. I've been a civil servant  and I've been in charge of policy for this guy as well. But what I want to talk about begins when I was at this city  this university  as a student. And then as now  it was a beautiful place of balls and punts  beautiful people  many of whom took to heart Ronald Reagan's comment that   even if they say hard work doesn't do you any harm  why risk it   But when I was here  a lot of my fellow teenagers were in a very different situation  leaving school at a time then of rapidly growing youth unemployment  and essentially hitting a brick wall in terms of their opportunities. And I spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts. And they were people who were not short of wit  or grace or energy  but they had no hope  no jobs  no prospects. And when people aren't allowed to be useful  they soon think that they're useless. And although that was great for the music business at the time  it wasn't much good for anything else. And ever since then  I've wondered why it is that capitalism is so amazingly efficient at some things  but so inefficient at others  why it's so innovative in some ways and so un innovative in others. Now  since that time  we've actually been through an extraordinary boom  the longest boom ever in the history of this country. Unprecedented wealth and prosperity  but that growth hasn't always delivered what we needed. H.L. Mencken once said that   to every complex problem  there is a simple solution and it's wrong.  But I'm not saying growth is wrong  but it's very striking that throughout the years of growth  many things didn't get better. Rates of depression carried on up  right across the Western world. If you look at America  the proportion of Americans with no one to talk to about important things went up from a tenth to a quarter. We commuted longer to work  but as you can see from this graph  the longer you commute the less happy you're likely to be. And it became ever clearer that economic growth doesn't automatically translate into social growth or human growth. We're now at another moment when another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market. There will be a million unemployed young people here by the end of the year  thousands losing their jobs everyday in America. We've got to do whatever we can to help them  but we've also got to ask  I think  a more profound question of whether we use this crisis to jump forward to a different kind of economy that's more suited to human needs  to a better balance of economy and society. And I think one of the lessons of history is that even the deepest crises can be moments of opportunity. They bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream. They often lead to the acceleration of much needed reforms. And you saw that in the '  s  when the Great Depression paved the way for Bretton Woods  welfare states and so on. And I think you can see around us now  some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism which could grow. You can see it in daily life. When times are hard  people have to do things for themselves  and right across the world  Oxford  Omaha  Omsk  you can see an extraordinary explosion of urban farming  people taking over land  taking over roofs  turning barges into temporary farms. And I'm a very small part of this. I have        of these things in my garden. A few of these. This is Atilla the hen. And I'm a very small part of a very large movement  which for some people is about survival  but is also about values  about a different kind of economy  which isn't so much about consumption and credit  but about things which matter to us. And everywhere too  you can see a proliferation of time banks and parallel currencies  people using smart technologies to link up all the resources freed up by the market    people  buildings  land    and linking them to whomever has got the most compelling needs. There's a similar story  I think  for governments. Ronald Reagan  again  said the two funniest sentences in the English language are   I'm from the government. And I'm here to help.  But I think last year when governments did step in  people were quite glad that they were there  that they did act. But now  a few months on  however good politicians are at swallowing frogs without pulling a face  as someone once put it  they can't hide their uncertainty. Because it's already clear how much of the enormous amount of money they put into the economy  really went into fixing the past  bailing out the banks  the car companies  not preparing us for the future. How much of the money is going into concrete and boosting consumption  not into solving the really profound problems we have to solve. And everywhere  as people think about the unprecedented sums which are being spent of our money and our children's money  now  in the depth of this crisis  they're asking  Surely  we should be using this with a longer term vision to accelerate the shift to a green economy  to prepare for aging  to deal with some of the inequalities which scar countries like this and the United States rather than just giving the money to the incumbents  Surely  we should be giving the money to entrepreneurs  to civil society  for people able to create the new  not to the big  well connected companies  big  clunky government programs. And  after all this  as the great Chinese sage Lao Tzu said   Governing a great country is like cooking a small fish. Don't overdo it.  And I think more and more people are also asking  Why boost consumption  rather than change what we consume  Like the mayor of S o Paulo who's banned advertising billboards  or the many cities like San Francisco putting in infrastructures for electric cars. You can see a bit of the same thing happening in the business world. Some  I think some of the bankers who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing. But ask yourselves  What will be the biggest sectors of the economy in            years time  It won't be the ones lining up for handouts  like cars and aerospace and so on. The biggest sector  by far  will be health    already    percent of the American economy  predicted to grow to     even    percent by mid century. Elder care  child care  already much bigger employers than cars. Education  six  seven  eight percent of the economy and growing. Environmental services  energy services  the myriad of green jobs  they're all pointing to a very different kind of economy which isn't just about products  but is using distributed networks  and it's founded above all on care  on relationships  on what people do to other people  often one to one  rather than simply selling them a product. And I think that what connects the challenge for civil society  the challenge for governments and the challenge for business now is  in a way  a very simple one  but quite a difficult one. We know our societies have to radically change. We know we can't go back to where we were before the crisis. But we also know it's only through experiment that we'll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city  how to care for a much older population  how to deal with drug addiction and so on. And here's the problem. In science  we do experiments systematically. Our societies now spend two  three  four percent of GDP to invest systematically in new discovery  in science  in technology  to fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions which illuminate gatherings like this. It's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago  maybe they are  but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did. And what's striking though  is that in society there's almost nothing comparable  no comparable investment  no systematic experiment  in the things capitalism isn't very good at  like compassion  or empathy  or relationships or care. Now  I didn't really understand that until I met this guy who was then an    year old  slightly shambolic man who lived on tomato soup and thought ironing was very overrated. He had helped shape Britain's post war institutions  its welfare state  its economy  but had sort of reinvented himself as a social entrepreneur  became an inventor of many  many different organizations. Some famous ones like the Open University  which has         students  the University of the Third Age  which has nearly half a million older people teaching other older people  as well as strange things like DIY garages and language lines and schools for social entrepreneurs. And he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists. He believed if you see a problem  you shouldn't tell someone to act  you should act on it yourself  and he lived long enough and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed that he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer. And his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers  not from a theory  but from experiment  and experiment involving the people with the best intelligence on social needs  which were usually the people living with those needs. And he believed we live with others  we share the world with others and therefore our innovation must be done with others too  not doing things at people  for them  and so on. Now  what he did didn't used to have a name  but I think it's rapidly becoming quite mainstream. It's what we do in the organization named after him where we try and invent  create  launch new ventures  whether it's schools  web companies  health organizations and so on. And we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement of institutions working on social innovation  using ideas from design or technology or community organizing to develop the germs of a future world  but through practice and through demonstration and not through theory. And they're spreading from Korea to Brazil to India to the USA and across Europe. And they've been given new momentum by the crisis  by the need for better answers to joblessness  community breakdown and so on. Some of the ideas are strange. These are complaints choirs. People come together to sing about the things that really bug them. Others are much more pragmatic  health coaches  learning mentors  job clubs. And some are quite structural  like social impact bonds where you raise money to invest in diverting teenagers from crime or helping old people keep out of hospital  and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are. Now  the idea that all of this represents  I think  is rapidly becoming a common sense and part of how we respond to the crisis  recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress. There were big health innovation funds launched earlier this year in this country  as well as a public service innovation lab. Across northern Europe  many governments now have innovation laboratories within them. And just a few months ago  President Obama launched the Office of Social Innovation in the White House. And what people are beginning to ask is  Surely  just as we invest in R and D  two  three  four percent  of our GDP  of our economy  what if we put  let's say  one percent of public spending into social innovation  into elder care  new kinds of education  new ways of helping the disabled  Perhaps we'd achieve similar productivity gains in society to those we've had in the economy and in technology. And if  a generation or two ago  the big challenges were ones like getting a man on the moon  perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now are ones like eliminating child malnutrition  stopping trafficking  or one  I think closer to home for America or Europe  why don't we set ourselves the goal of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens. Now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade  but only with radical and systematic experiment  not just with technologies  but also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too. Now  I want to end by saying a little bit about what I think this means for capitalism. I think what this is all about  this whole movement which is growing from the margins  remains quite small. Nothing like the resources of a CERN or a DARPA or an IBM or a Dupont. What it's telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social. It's already immersed in social networks. It will become more involved in social investment  and social care and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others  not just from what you sell to them  and from relationships as well as from consumption. But interestingly too  it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism about how you embed the DNA of restless continual innovation into society  trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work. Now  I think this future will be quite surprising to many people. In recent years  a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won. History was over and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy. But I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today and how they talked about the monarchy     years ago  just after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France. Then  people said monarchy dominated everywhere because it was rooted in human nature. We were naturally deferential. We needed hierarchy. Just as today  the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism say it's rooted in human nature  only now it's individualism  inquisitiveness  and so on. Then monarchy had seen off its big challenger  mass democracy  which was seen as a well intentioned but doomed experiment  just as capitalism has seen off socialism. Even Fidel Castro now says that the only thing worse than being exploited by multinational capitalism is not being exploited by multinational capitalism. And whereas then monarchies  palaces and forts dominated every city skyline and looked permanent and confident  today it's the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city. I'm not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades and string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost  though that might be quite tempting. But I do think we're on the verge of a period when  just as happened to the monarchy and  interestingly  the military too  the central position of finance capital is going to come to an end  and it's going to steadily move to the sides  the margins of our society  transformed from being a master into a servant  a servant to the productive economy and of human needs. And as that happens  we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism  which is that  unlike what you read in economics textbooks  it's not a self sufficient system. It depends on other systems  on ecology  on family  on community  and if these aren't replenished  capitalism suffers too. And our human nature isn't just selfish  it's also compassionate. It's not just competitive  it's also caring. Because of the depth of the crisis  I think we are at a moment of choice. The crisis is almost certainly deepening around us. It will be worse at the end of this year  quite possibly worse in a year's time than it is today. But this is one of those very rare moments when we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously to get back to where we were a year or two ago  and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for  or whether this is a moment to jump ahead  to reboot and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway. Thank you. I'm a creative technologist and the focus of my work is on public installations. One of my driving passions is this idea of exploring nature  and trying to find hidden data within nature. It seems to me that there is this latent potential everywhere  all around us. Everything gives out some kind of data  whether it's sound or smell or vibration. Through my work  I've been trying to find ways to harness and unveil this. And so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics. Now  cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water  as you can see there. So  if we have a quick look at the history of cymatics beginning with the observations of resonance  by Da Vinci  Galileo  the English scientist Robert Hook and then Ernest Chladni. He created an experiment using a metal plate  covering it with sand and then bowing it to create the Chladni patterns that you see here on the right. Moving on from this  the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called Hans Jenny in the     s. He actually coined the term cymatics. Then bringing us into the present day is a fellow collaborator of mine and cymatics expert  John Stewart Reed. He's kindly recreated for us the Chladni experiment. What we can see here is the metal sheet  this time connected to a sound driver and being fed by a frequency generator. As the frequencies increase  so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate. As you can see with your own eyes. So  what excites me about cymatics  Well  for me cymatics is an almost magical tool. It's like a looking glass into a hidden world. Through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics  we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen. Devices like the cymascope  which you can see here  have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns. And the list of scientific applications is growing every day. For example  in oceanography  a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created by basically visualizing the sonar beams that the dolphins emit. And hopefully in the future we'll be able to gain some deeper understanding of how they communicate. We can also use cymatics for healing and education. This is an installation developed with school children  where their hands are tracked. It allows them to control and position cymatic patterns and the reflections that are caused by them. We can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form. This image here is created from a snippet of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device. So it kind of flips things on its head a little bit. This is Pink Floyd's  Machine  playing in real time through the cymascope. We can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature. And we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature. So  for example  here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature. Then on the right we can see a cymatically created snowflake. And here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish. And there is thousands of these. So what does this all mean  Well  there is still a lot to explore in its early days. And there's not many people working in this field. But consider for a moment that sound does have form. We've seen that it can affect matter and cause form within matter. Then sort of take a leap and think about the universe forming. And think about the immense sound of the universe forming. And if we kind of ponder on that  then perhaps cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself. And here is some eye candy for you  from a range of DIY scientists and artists from all over the globe. Cymatics is accessible to everybody. I want to urge everybody here to apply your passion  your knowledge and your skills to areas like cymatics. I think collectively we can build a global community. We can inspire each other. And we can evolve this exploration of the substance of things not seen. Thank you. I'm extremely excited to be given the opportunity to come and speak to you today about what I consider to be the biggest stunt on Earth. Or perhaps not quite on Earth. A parachute jump from the very edge of space. More about that a bit later on. What I'd like to do first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television  and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before. I've been a professional stunt man for    years. I'm a stunt coordinator. And as well as perform stunts I often design them. During that time  health and safety has become everything about my job. It's critical now that when a car crash happens it isn't just the stunt person we make safe  it's the crew. We can't be killing camera men. We can't be killing stunt men. We can't be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set  or any passerby. So  safety is everything. But it wasn't always that way. In the old days of the silent movies    Harold Lloyd here  hanging famously from the clock hands    a lot of these guys did their own stunts. They were quite remarkable. They had no safety  no real technology. What safety they had was very scant. This is the first stunt woman  Rosie Venger  an amazing woman. You can see from the slide  very very strong. She really paved the way at a time when nobody was doing stunts  let alone women. My favorite and a real hero of mine is Yakima Canutt. Yakima Canutt really formed the stunt fight. He worked with John Wayne and most of those old punch ups you see in the Westerns. Yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated. This is a screen capture from  Stagecoach   where Yakima Canutt is doing one of the most dangerous stunts I've ever seen. There is no safety  no back support  no pads  no crash mats  no sand pits in the ground. That's one of the most dangerous horse stunts  certainly. Talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date  some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts. We couldn't do them without technology. These are particularly dangerous because there is no mask on my face. They were done for a photo shoot. One for the Sun newspaper  one for FHM magazine. Highly dangerous  but also you'll notice it doesn't look as though I'm wearing anything underneath the suit. The fire suits of old  the bulky suits  the thick woolen suits  have been replaced with modern materials like Nomex or  more recently  Carbonex    fantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionals to burn for longer  look more spectacular  and in pure safety. Here's a bit more. There's a guy with a flame thrower there  giving me what for. One of the things that a stuntman often does  and you'll see it every time in the big movies  is be blown through the air. Well  we used to use trampettes. In the old days  that's all they had. And that's a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air  and hopefully you make it look good. Now we've got technology. This thing is called an air ram. It's a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer  because it will break your legs very  very quickly if you land on it wrong. Having said that  it works with compressed nitrogen. And that's in the up position. When you step on it  either by remote control or with the pressure of your foot  it will fire you  depending on the gas pressure  anything from five feet to    feet. I could  quite literally  fire myself into the gallery. Which I'm sure you wouldn't want. Not today. Car stunts are another area where technology and engineering advances have made life easier for us  and safer. We can do bigger car stunts than ever before now. Being run over is never easy. That's an old fashioned  hard  gritty  physical stunt. But we have padding  and fantastic shock absorbing things like Sorbothane    the materials that help us  when we're hit like this  not to hurt ourselves too much. The picture in the bottom right hand corner there is of some crash test dummy work that I was doing. Showing how stunts work in different areas  really. And testing breakaway signpost pillars. A company makes a Lattix pillar  which is a network  a lattice type pillar that collapses when it's hit. The car on the left drove into the steel pillar. And you can't see it from there  but the engine was in the driver's lap. They did it by remote control. I drove the other one at    miles an hour  exactly the same speed  and clearly walked away from it. Rolling a car over is another area where we use technology. We used to have to drive up a ramp  and we still do sometimes. But now we have a compressed nitrogen cannon. You can just see  underneath the car  there is a black rod on the floor by the wheel of the other car. That's the piston that was fired out of the floor. We can flip lorries  coaches  buses  anything over with a nitrogen cannon with enough power.  Laughs  It's a great job  really.  Laughter  It's such fun  You should hear some of the phone conversations that I have with people on my Bluetooth in the shop.  Well  we can flip the bus over  we can have it burst into flames  and how about someone  you know  big explosion.  And people are looking like this ... I sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are. The next thing that I'd like to show you is something that Dunlop asked me to do earlier this year with our Channel Five's  Fifth Gear Show.  A loop the loop  biggest in the world. Only one person had ever done it before. Now  the stuntman solution to this in the old days would be   Let's hit this as fast as possible.    miles an hour. Let's just go for it. Foot flat to the floor.  Well  you'd die if you did that. We went to Cambridge University  the other university  and spoke to a Doctor of Mechanical Engineering there  a physicist who taught us that it had to be    miles an hour. Even then  I caught seven G and lost a bit of consciousness on the way in. That's a long way to fall  if you get it wrong. That was just about right. So again  science helps us  and with the engineering too    the modifications to the car and the wheel. High falls  they're old fashioned stunts. What's interesting about high falls is that although we use airbags  and some airbags are quite advanced  they're designed so you don't slip off the side like you used to  if you land a bit wrong. So  they're a much safer proposition. Just basically though  it is a basic piece of equipment. It's a bouncy castle with slats in the side to allow the air to escape. That's all it is  a bouncy castle. That's the only reason we do it. See  it's all fun  this job. What's interesting is we still use cardboard boxes. They used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them. And that's interesting because they are almost retrospective. They're great for catching you  up to certain heights. And on the other side of the fence  that physical art  the physical performance of the stuntman  has interfaced with the very highest technology in I.T. and in software. Not the cardboard box  but the green screen. This is a shot of  Terminator   the movie. Two stunt guys doing what I consider to be a rather benign stunt. It's    feet. It's water. It's very simple. With the green screen we can put any background in the world on it  moving or still  and I can assure you  nowadays you can't see the joint. This is a parachutist with another parachutist doing exactly the same thing. Completely in the safety of a studio  and yet with the green screen we can have some moving image that a skydiver took  and put in the sky moving and the clouds whizzing by. Decelerator rigs and wires  we use them a lot. We fly people on wires  like this. This guy is not skydiving. He's being flown like a kite  or moved around like a kite. And this is a Guinness World Record attempt. They asked me to open their   th anniversary show in     . And again  technology meant that I could do the fastest abseil over     meters  and stop within a couple of feet of the ground without melting the rope with the friction  because of the alloys I used in the descender device. And that's Centre Point in London. We brought Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road to a standstill. Helicopter stunts are always fun  hanging out of them  whatever. And aerial stunts. No aerial stunt would be the same without skydiving. Which brings us quite nicely to why I'm really here today  Project Space Jump. In       Joseph Kittenger of the United States Air Force did the most spectacular thing. He did a jump from         feet          to be precise  and he did it to test high altitude systems for military pilots in the new range of aircraft that were going up to        feet or so. And I'd just like to show you a little footage of what he did back then. And just how brave he was in       bear in mind. Project Excelsior  it was called. There were three jumps. They first dropped some dummies. So that's the balloon  big gas balloon. It's that shape because the helium has to expand. My balloon will expand to     times and look like a big pumpkin when it's at the top. These are the dummies being dropped from         feet  and there is the camera that's strapped to them. You can clearly see the curvature of the Earth at that kind of altitude. And I'm planning to go from         feet  which is about    miles. You're in a near vacuum in that environment  which is in minus    degrees. So it's an extremely hostile place to be. This is Joe Kittenger himself. Bear in mind  ladies and gents  this was     . He didn't know if he would live or die. This is an extremely brave man. I spoke with him on the phone a few months ago. He's a very humble and wonderful human being. He sent me an email  saying   If you get this thing off the ground I wish you all the best.  And he signed it   Happy landings   which I thought was quite lovely. He's in his   s and he lives in Florida. He's a tremendous guy. This is him in a pressure suit. Now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is when you get to        feet    it's great  isn't it     When you get to        feet you can really only use oxygen. Above        feet up to nearly        feet  you need pressure breathing  which is where you're wearing a G suit. This is him in his old rock and roll jeans there  pushing him in  those turned up jeans. You need a pressure suit. You need a pressure breathing system with a G suit that squeezes you  that helps you to breathe in and helps you to exhale. Above        feet you need a space suit  a pressure suit. Certainly at         feet no aircraft will fly. Not even a jet engine. It needs to be rocket powered or one of these things  a great big gas balloon. It took me a while  it took me years to find the right balloon team to build the balloon that would do this job. I've found that team in America now. And it's made of polyethylene  so it's very thin. We will have two balloons for each of my test jumps  and two balloons for the main jump  because they notoriously tear on takeoff. They're just so  so delicate. This is the step off. He's written on that thing   The highest step in the world.  And what must that feel like  I'm excited and I'm scared  both at the same time in equal measures. And this is the camera that he had on him as he tumbled before his drogue chute opened to stabilize him. A drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down. You can just see them there  popping open. Those are the drogue chutes. He had three of them. I did quite a lot of research. And you'll see in a second there  he comes back down to the floor. Now just to give you some perspective of this balloon  the little black dots are people. It's hundreds of feet high. It's enormous. That's in New Mexico. That's the U.S. Air Force Museum. And they've made a dummy of him. That's exactly what it looked like. My gondola will be more simple than that. It's a three sided box  basically. So I've had to do quite a lot of training. This is Morocco last year in the Atlas mountains  training in preparation for some high altitude jumps. This is what the view is going to be like at        feet for me. Now you may think this is just a thrill seeking trip  a pleasure ride  just the world's biggest stunt. Well there's a little bit more to it than that. Trying to find a space suit to do this has led me to an area of technology that I never really expected when I set about doing this. I contacted a company in the States who make suits for NASA. That's a current suit. This was me last year with their chief engineer. That suit would cost me about a million and a half dollars. And it weighs     pounds and you can't skydive in it. So I've been stuck. For the past    years I've been trying to find a space suit that would do this job  or someone that will make one. Something revolutionary happened a little while ago  at the same facility. That's the prototype of the parachute. I've now had them custom make one  the only one of its kind in the world. And that's the only suit of its kind in the world. It was made by a Russian that's designed most of the suits of the past    years for the Soviets. He left the company because he saw  as some other people in the space suit industry  an emerging market for space suits for space tourists. You know if you are in an aircraft at        feet and the cabin depressurizes  you can have oxygen. If you're at         feet you die. In six seconds you've lost consciousness. In    seconds you're dead. Your blood tries to boil. It's called vaporization. The body swells up. It's awful. And so we expect    it's not much fun. We expect  and others expect  that perhaps the FAA  the CAA might say   You need to put someone in a suit that's not inflated  that's connected to the aircraft.  Then they're comfortable  they have good vision  like this great big visor. And then if the cabin depressurizes while the aircraft is coming back down  in whatever emergency measures  everyone is okay. I would like to bring Costa on  if he's here  to show you the only one of its kind in the world. I was going to wear it  but I thought I'd get Costa to do it  my lovely assistant. Thank you. He's very hot. Thank you  Costa. This is the communication headset you'll see on lots of space suits. It's a two layer suit. NASA suits have got    layers. This is a very lightweight suit. It weighs about    pounds. It's next to nothing. Especially designed for me. It's a working prototype. I will use it for all the jumps. Would you just give us a little twirl  please  Costa  Thank you very much. And it doesn't look far different when it's inflated  as you can see from the picture down there. I've even skydived in it in a wind tunnel  which means that I can practice everything I need to practice  in safety  before I ever jump out of anything. Thanks very much  Costa. Ladies and gentlemen  that's just about it from me. The status of my mission at the moment is it still needs a major sponsor. I'm confident that we'll find one. I think it's a great challenge. And I hope that you will agree with me  it is the greatest stunt on Earth. Thank you very much for your time. Most of the time  art and science stare at each other across a gulf of mutual incomprehension. There is great confusion when the two look at each other. Art  of course  looks at the world through the psyche  the emotions    the unconscious at times    and of course the aesthetic. Science tends to look at the world through the rational  the quantitative    things that can be measured and described    but it gives art a terrific context of understanding. In the Extreme Ice Survey  we're dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together  to merging the art and science to the end of helping us understand nature and humanity's relationship with nature better. Specifically  I as a person who's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life  am firmly of the belief that photography  video  film have tremendous powers for helping us understand and shape the way we think about nature and about ourselves in relationship to nature. In this project  we're specifically interested  of course  in ice. I'm fascinated by the beauty of it  the mutability of it  the malleability of it  and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself. These first images are from Greenland. But ice has another meaning. Ice is the canary in the global coal mine. It's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action. Climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world. Whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of is it raining more or is it raining less  Is it getting hotter or is it getting colder  What do the computer models say about this  that and the other thing  All of that  strip it away. In the world of the arctic and alpine environments  where the ice is  it's real and it's present. The changes are happening. They're very visible. They're photographable. They're measurable.    percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking. That's outside Antarctica.    percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking  and that's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing. There is no significant scientific dispute about that. It's been observed  it's measured  it's bomb proof information. And the great irony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that. Science is not arguing about that. In these images we see ice from enormous glaciers  ice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old breaking up into chunks  and chunk by chunk by chunk  iceberg by iceberg  turning into global sea level rise. So  having seen all of this in the course of a    year career  I was still a skeptic about climate change until about    years ago  because I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models. I hadn't realized it was based on concrete measurements of what the paleoclimates    the ancient climates    were  as recorded in the ice sheets  as recorded in deep ocean sediments  as recorded in lake sediments  tree rings  and a lot of other ways of measuring temperature. When I realized that climate change was real  and it was not based on computer models  I decided that one day I would do a project looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically. And that led me to this project. Initially  I was working on a National Geographic assignment    conventional  single frame  still photography. And one crazy day  I got the idea that I should    after that assignment was finished    I got the idea that I should shoot in time lapse photography  that I should station a camera or two at a glacier and let it shoot every    minutes  or every hour or whatever and watch the progression of the landscape over time. Well  within about three weeks  I incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time lapse cameras into    time lapse cameras. And the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career  trying to design  build and deploy out in the field these    time lapse cameras. They are powered by the sun. Solar panels power them. Power goes into a battery. There is a custom made computer that tells the camera when to fire. And these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers  and they look in on the glacier from permanent  bedrock positions  and they watch the evolution of the landscape. We just had a number of cameras out on the Greenland Ice Sheet. We actually drilled holes into the ice  way deep down below the thawing level  and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so. Actually  there's still a camera out there right now. In any case  the cameras shoot roughly every hour. Some of them shoot every half hour  every    minutes  every five minutes. Here's a time lapse of one of the time lapse units being made. I personally obsessed about every nut  bolt and washer in these crazy things. I spent half my life at our local hardware store during the months when we built these units originally. We're working in most of the major glaciated regions of the northern hemisphere. Our time lapse units are in Alaska  the Rockies  Greenland and Iceland  and we have repeat photography positions  that is places we just visit on an annual basis  in British Columbia  the Alps and Bolivia. It's a big undertaking. I stand here before you tonight as an ambassador for my whole team. There's a lot of people working on this right now. We've got    cameras out this moment. We just had    cameras shoot about half an hour ago all across the northern hemisphere  watching what's happened. And we've spent a lot of time in the field. It's been a fantastic amount of work. We've been out for two and a half years  and we've got about another two and a half years yet to go. That's only half our job. The other half of our job is to tell the story to the global public. You know  scientists have collected this kind of information off and on over the years  but a lot of it stays within the science community. Similarly  a lot of art projects stay in the art community  and I feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like TED  and like our relationship with the Obama White House  with the Senate  with John Kerry  to influence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well. We've done films. We've done books. We have more coming. We have a site on Google Earth that Google Earth was generous enough to give us  and so forth  because we feel very much the need to tell this story  because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now. Now  one bit of science before we get into the visuals. If everybody in the developed world understood this graph  and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads  there would be no further societal argument about climate change because this is the story that counts. Everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion. Key issues  this is a         year record. This exact same pattern is seen going back now almost a million years before our current time. And several things are important. Number one  temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere go up and down basically in sync. You can see that from the orange line and the blue line. Nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to     parts per million. That's the natural cycle. Goes up to     and then drops for various reasons that aren't important to discuss right here. But     is the peak. Right now  if you look at the top right part of that graph  we're at     parts per million. We are way  way outside the normal  natural variability. Earth is having a fever. In the past hundred years  the temperature of the Earth has gone up  .  degrees Fahrenheit  .   degrees Celsius  and it's going to keep going up because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere. At the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year. It's been a remorseless  steady increase. We have to turn that around. That's the crux  and someday I hope to emblazon that across Times Square in New York and a lot of other places. But anyway  off to the world of ice. We're now at the Columbia Glacier in Alaska. This is a view of what's called the calving face. This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months. You see the glacier flowing in from the right  dropping off into the sea  camera shooting every hour. If you look in the middle background  you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo yo. That means that glacier's floating and it's unstable  and you're about to see the consequences of that floating. To give you a little bit of a sense of scale  that calving face in this picture is about     feet tall. That's    stories. This is not a little cliff. This is like a major office building in an urban center. The calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off  but in fact  it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet. So there's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep going down to bedrock if the glacier's grounded on bedrock  and floating if it isn't. Here's what Columbia's done. This is in south central Alaska. This was an aerial picture I did one day in June three years ago. This is an aerial picture we did this year. That's the retreat of this glacier. The main stem  the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right and it's going very rapidly up that stem. We're going to be up there in just a few more weeks  and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile  but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back  I wouldn't be the least bit surprised. Now it's really hard to grasp the scale of these places  because as the glaciers    one of the things is that places like Alaska and Greenland are huge  they're not normal landscapes    but as the glaciers are retreating  they're also deflating  like air is being let out of a balloon. And so  there are features on this landscape. There's a ridge right in the middle of the picture  up above where that arrow comes in  that shows you that a little bit. There's a marker line called the trim line above our little red illustration there. This is something no self respecting photographer would ever do    you put some cheesy illustration on your shot  right     and yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points. But  in any case  the deflation of this glacier since      has been higher than the Eiffel Tower  higher than the Empire State Building. A tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys as it's retreated and deflated  gone back up valley. These changes in the alpine world are accelerating. It's not static. Particularly in the world of sea ice  the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago  and the processes either are accelerating or the predictions were too low to begin with. But in any case  there are big  big changes happening as we speak. So  here's another time lapse shot of Columbia. And you see where it ended in these various spring days  June  May  then October. Now we turn on our time lapse. This camera was shooting every hour. Geologic process in action here. And everybody says  well don't they advance in the winter time  No. It was retreating through the winter because it's an unhealthy glacier. Finally catches up to itself  it advances. And you can look at these pictures over and over again because there's such a strange  bizarre fascination in seeing these things you don't normally get to see come alive. We've been talking about  seeing is believing   and seeing the unseen at TED Global. That's what you see with these cameras. The images make the invisible visible. These huge crevasses open up. These great ice islands break off    and now watch this. This has been the springtime this year    a huge collapse. That happened in about a month  the loss of all that ice. So that's where we started three years ago  way out on the left  and that's where we were a few months ago  the last time we went into Columbia. To give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat  we did another cheesy illustration  with British double decker buses. If you line up     of those nose to tail  that's about how far back that was. It's a long way. On up to Iceland. One of my favorite glaciers  the S lheimaj kull. And here  if you watch  you can see the terminus retreating. You can see this river being formed. You can see it deflating. Without the photographic process  you would never see this. This is invisible. You can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this  but the camera records it. So we wind time backwards now. We go back a couple years in time. That's where it started. That's where it ended a few months ago. And on up to Greenland. The smaller the ice mass  the faster it responds to climate. Greenland took a little while to start reacting to the warming climate of the past century  but it really started galloping along about    years ago. And there's been a tremendous increase in the temperature up there. It's a big place. That's all ice. All those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick  just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle. The one glacier up in Greenland that puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined is the Ilulissat Glacier. We have some cameras on the south edge of the Ilulissat  watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat. Here's a two year record of what that looks like. Helicopter in front of the calving face for scale  quickly dwarfed. The calving face is four and a half miles across  and in this shot  as we pull back  you're only seeing about a mile and a half. So  imagine how big this is and how much ice is charging out. The interior of Greenland is to the right. It's flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left. Icebergs  many  many  many  many times the size of this building  are roaring out to sea. We just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago  as you can see. June   th  monster calving events happened. I'll show you one of those in a second. This glacier has doubled its flow speed in the past    years. It now goes at     feet a day  dumping all this ice into the ocean. It tends to go in these pulses  about every three days  but on average      feet a day  twice the rate it did    years ago. Okay. We had a team out watching this glacier  and we recorded the biggest calving event that's ever been put on film. We had nine cameras going. This is what a couple of the cameras saw. A     foot tall calving face breaking off. Huge icebergs rolling over. Okay  how big was that  It's hard to get it. So an illustration again  gives you a feeling for scale. A mile of retreat in    minutes across the calving face  in that particular event  three miles wide. The block was three fifths of a mile deep  and if you compare the expanse of the calving face to the Tower Bridge in London  about    bridges wide. Or if you take an American reference  to the U.S. Capitol Building and you pack       Capitol Buildings into that block  it would be equivalent to how large that block was.    minutes. Now I've come to the conclusion after spending a lot of time in this climate change world that we don't have a problem of economics  technology and public policy. We have a problem of perception. The policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough issues  but we actually can deal with them. I'm certain that we can. But what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet. You're an elite audience. You get it. Fortunately  a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now. But we still need to bring a lot of people along with us. And that's where I think organizations like TED  like the Extreme Ice Survey can have a terrific impact on human perception and bring us along. Because I believe we have an opportunity right now. We are nearly on the edge of a crisis  but we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge of our generation and  in fact  of our century. This is a terrific  terrific call to arms to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future. I hope that we have the wisdom to let the angels of our better nature rise to the occasion and do what needs to be done. Thank you. Today I want to talk to you about swimming across the North Pole  across the most northern place in the whole world. And perhaps the best place to start is with my late father. He was a great storyteller. He could tell a story about an event  and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment. And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy was of the first British atomic bomb test. He had been there and watched it go off. And he said that the explosion was so loud and the light was so intense  that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes. And he said that he could actually see an x ray of his fingers  because the light was so bright. And I know that watching that atomic bomb going off had a very  very big impact on my late father. Every holiday I had as a young boy was in a national park. What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world  and show me just how fragile the world is. He also told me about the great explorers. He loved history. He would tell me about Captain Scott walking all the way to the South Pole and Sir Edmund Hillary climbing up Mount Everest. And so ever since I think I was just six years old  I dreamed of going to the polar regions. I really  really wanted to go to the Arctic. There was something about that place which drew me to it. And  well  sometimes it takes a long time for a dream to come true. But seven years ago  I went to the Arctic for the first time. And it was so beautiful that I've been back there ever since  for the last seven years. I love the place. But I have seen that place change beyond all description  just in that short period of time. I have seen polar bears walking across very  very thin ice in search of food. I have swum in front of glaciers which have retreated so much. And I have also  every year  seen less and less sea ice. And I wanted the world to know what was happening up there. In the two years before my swim     percent of the arctic sea ice cover just melted away. And I wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders to get them to understand what is happening. So I decided to do this symbolic swim at the top of the world  in a place which should be frozen over  but which now is rapidly unfreezing. And the message was very clear  Climate change is for real  and we need to do something about it. And we need to do something about it right now. Well  swimming across the North Pole  it's not an ordinary thing to do. I mean  just to put it in perspective     degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool. This morning  the temperature of the English Channel was    degrees. The passengers who fell off the Titanic fell into water of just five degrees centigrade. Fresh water freezes at zero. And the water at the North Pole is minus  . . It's fucking freezing. I'm sorry  but there is no other way to describe it. And so I had to assemble an incredible team around me to help me with this task. I assembled this team of    people from    nations. Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport  you just dive into the sea and off you go. It couldn't be further from the truth for me. And I then went and did a huge amount of training  swimming in icy water  backwards and forwards. But the most important thing was to train my mind to prepare myself for what was going to happen. And I had to visualize the swim. I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end. I had to taste the salt water in my mouth. I had to see my coach screaming for me   Come on Lewis  Come on  Go  Go  Go  Don't slow down   And so I literally swam across the North Pole hundreds and hundreds of times in my mind. And then  after a year of training  I felt ready. I felt confident that I could actually do this swim. So myself and the five members of the team  we hitched a ride on an icebreaker which was going to the North Pole. And on day four  we decided to just do a quick five minute test swim. I had never swum in water of minus  .  degrees before  because it's just impossible to train in those types of conditions. So we stopped the ship  as you do. We all got down onto the ice  and I then got into my swimming costume and I dived into the sea. I have never in my life felt anything like that moment. I could barely breathe. I was gasping for air. I was hyperventilating so much  and within seconds my hands were numb. And it was    the paradox is that you're in freezing cold water  but actually you're on fire. I swam as hard as I could for five minutes. I remember just trying to get out of the water. I climbed out of the ice. And I remember taking the goggles off my face and looking down at my hands in sheer shock  because my fingers had swollen so much that they were like sausages. And they were swollen so much  I couldn't even close them. What had happened is that we are made partially of water  and when water freezes it expands. And so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded. And they had burst. And I was in so much agony. I immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower. And I remember standing underneath the hot shower and trying to defrost my fingers. And I thought  in two days' time  I was going to do this swim across the North Pole. I was going to try and do a    minute swim  for one kilometer across the North Pole. And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy with my father  was just going out the window. There is no possibility that this was going to happen. And I remember then getting out of the shower and realizing I couldn't even feel my hands. And for a swimmer  you need to feel your hands because you need to be able to grab the water and pull it through with you. The next morning  I woke up and I was in such a state of depression  and all I could think about was Sir Ranulph Fiennes. For those of you who don't know him  he's the great British explorer. A number of years ago  he tried to ski all the way to the North Pole. He accidentally fell through the ice into the sea. And after just three minutes in that water  he was able to get himself out. And his hands were so badly frostbitten that he had to return to England. He went to a local hospital and there they said   Ran  there is no possibility of us being able to save these fingers. We are going to actually have to take them off.  And Ran decided to go into his tool shed and take out a saw and do it himself. And all I could think of was  if that happened to Ran after three minutes  and I can't feel my hands after five minutes  what on earth is going to happen if I try    minutes  At the very best  I'm going to end up losing some fingers. And at worst  I didn't even want to think about it. We carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the North Pole. And my close friend David  he saw the way I was thinking  and he came up to me and he said   Lewis  I've known you since you were    years old. I've known you  and I know  Lewis  deep down  right deep down here  that you are going to make this swim. I so believe in you Lewis. I've seen the way you've been training. And I realize the reason why you're going to do this. This is such an important swim. We stand at a very  very important moment in this history  and you're going to make a symbolic swim here to try to shake the lapels of world leaders. Lewis  have the courage to go in there  because we are going to look after you every moment of it.  And I just  I got so much confidence from him saying that  because he knew me so well. So we carried on sailing and we arrived at the North Pole. And we stopped the ship  and it was just as the scientists had predicted. There were open patches of sea everywhere. And I went down into my cabin and I put on my swimming costume. And then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor  which measures my core body temperature and my heart rate. And then we walked out onto the ice. And I remember looking into the ice  and there were big chunks of white ice in there  and the water was completely black. I had never seen black water before. And it is       meters deep. And I said to myself   Lewis  don't look left  don't look right. Just scuttle forward and go for it.  And so I now want to show you a short video of what happened there on the ice. Narrator  Video   We're just sailing out of harbor now  and it's at this stage when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally. Everything just looks so gray around here  and looks so cold. We've just seen our first polar bears. It was absolutely magical. A mother and a cub  such a beautiful sight. And to think that in        years they could become extinct. It's a very frightening  very  very frightening thought. We're finally at the North Pole. This is months and months and months of dreaming to get here  years of training and planning and preparation. Ooh. In a couple of hours' time I'm going to get in here and do my swim. It's all a little bit frightening  and emotional. Amundson  you ready  Amudson  Ready. Lewis Pugh  Ten seconds to swim. Ten seconds to swim. Take the goggles off. Take the goggles off  Man  Take the shoes. Take the shoes. Well done lad  You did it  You did it Lewis  You did it  You did it man  LP  How on earth did we do that  Man  Against the current  You did it against the current  LP  Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Audience  Encore  LP  I'd just like to end off by just saying this  It took me four months again to feel my hands. But was it worth it  Yes  absolutely it was. There are very  very few people who don't know now about what is happening in the Arctic. And people ask me   Lewis  what can we do about climate change   And I say to them  I think we need to do three things. The first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down into manageable chunks. You saw during that video all those flags. Those flags represented the countries from which my team came from. And equally  when it comes to climate change  every single country is going to have to make cuts. Britain  America  Japan  South Africa  the Congo. All of us together  we're all on the same ship together. The second thing we need to do is we need to just look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time. I remember  just a few years ago  speaking about climate change  and people heckling me in the back and saying it doesn't even exist. I've just come back from giving a series of speeches in some of the poorest townships in South Africa to young children as young as    years old. Four or five children sitting behind a desk  and even in those poorest conditions  they all have a very  very good grasp of climate change. We need to believe in ourselves. Now is the time to believe. We've come a long way. We're doing good. But the most important thing we must do is  I think  we must all walk to the end of our lives and turn around  and ask ourselves a most fundamental question. And that is   What type of world do we want to live in  and what decision are we going to make today to ensure that we all live in a sustainable world   Ladies and gentlemen  thank you very  very much. Today I'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds. And the problem I'm going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy  which is   How can we know whether other people have minds   That is  maybe you have a mind  and everyone else is just a really convincing robot. So that's a problem in philosophy  but for today's purposes I'm going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind  and that I don't have to worry about this. There is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us as parents and teachers and spouses and novelists  which is   Why is it so hard to know what somebody else wants or believes   Or perhaps  more relevantly   Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes   I think novelists put this best. Like Philip Roth  who said   And yet  what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people  So ill equipped are we all  to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims.  So as a teacher and as a spouse  this is  of course  a problem I confront every day. But as a scientist  I'm interested in a different problem of other minds  and that is the one I'm going to introduce to you today. And that problem is   How is it so easy to know other minds   So to start with an illustration  you need almost no information  one snapshot of a stranger  to guess what this woman is thinking  or what this man is. And put another way  the crux of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds  our brain  is made up of pieces  brain cells  that we share with all other animals  with monkeys and mice and even sea slugs. And yet  you put them together in a particular network  and what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet. Or to say  as Alan Greenspan did   I know you think you understand what you thought I said  but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant.  So  the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience is to stand with these ideas  one in each hand. And to try to understand how you can put together simple units  simple messages over space and time  in a network  and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds. So I'm going to tell you three things about this today. Obviously the whole project here is huge. And I'm going to tell you just our first few steps about the discovery of a special brain region for thinking about other people's thoughts. Some observations on the slow development of this system as we learn how to do this difficult job. And then finally  to show that some of the differences between people  in how we judge others  can be explained by differences in this brain system. So first  the first thing I want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain  in your brains  whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts. This is a picture of it. It's called the Right Temporo Parietal Junction. It's above and behind your right ear. And this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you  or when you read Romeo and Juliet or when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan. And you don't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems. So this brain region is called the Right TPJ. And this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults. They're MIT undergraduates. The second thing I want to say about this brain system is that although we human adults are really good at understanding other minds  we weren't always that way. It takes children a long time to break into the system. I'm going to show you a little bit of that long  extended process. The first thing I'm going to show you is a change between age three and five  as kids learn to understand that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own. So I'm going to show you a five year old who is getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task. Rebecca Saxe  Video   This is the first pirate. His name is Ivan. And you know what pirates really like  Child  What  RS  Pirates really like cheese sandwiches. Child  Cheese  I love cheese  RS  Yeah. So Ivan has this cheese sandwich  and he says   Yum yum yum yum yum  I really love cheese sandwiches.  And Ivan puts his sandwich over here  on top of the pirate chest. And Ivan says   You know what  I need a drink with my lunch.  And so Ivan goes to get a drink. And while Ivan is away the wind comes  and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass. And now  here comes the other pirate. This pirate is called Joshua. And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches. So Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says   Yum yum yum yum yum  I love cheese sandwiches.  And he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest. Child  So  that one is his. RS  That one is Joshua's. That's right. Child  And then his went on the ground. RS  That's exactly right. Child  So he won't know which one is his. RS  Oh. So now Joshua goes off to get a drink. Ivan comes back and he says   I want my cheese sandwich.  So which one do you think Ivan is going to take  Child  I think he is going to take that one. RS  Yeah  you think he's going to take that one  All right. Let's see. Oh yeah  you were right. He took that one. So that's a five year old who clearly understands that other people can have false beliefs and what the consequences are for their actions. Now I'm going to show you a three year old who got the same puzzle. RS  And Ivan says   I want my cheese sandwich.  Which sandwich is he going to take  Do you think he's going to take that one  Let's see what happens. Let's see what he does. Here comes Ivan. And he says   I want my cheese sandwich.  And he takes this one. Uh oh. Why did he take that one  Child  His was on the grass. So the three year old does two things differently. First  he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich that's really his. And second  when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his  where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his  the three year old comes up with another explanation  He's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it  because now it's dirty  on the ground. So that's why he's taking the other sandwich. Now of course  development doesn't end at five. And we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now  not for an action prediction  but for a moral judgment. So first I'm going to show you the three year old again. RS.  So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich  Child  Yeah. RS  Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich  Child  Yeah. So it's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of Ivan to take Joshua's sandwich  since he thinks Ivan only took Joshua's sandwich to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich. But now I'm going to show you the five year old. Remember the five year old completely understood why Ivan took Joshua's sandwich. RS  Was Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich  Child  Um  yeah. And so  it is not until age seven that we get what looks more like an adult response. RS  Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich  Child  No  because the wind should get in trouble. He says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches. And now what we've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts. So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region  the Right TPJ  being used while children are thinking about other people. But it's not quite like the adult brain. So whereas in the adults  as I told you  this brain region is almost completely specialized    it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people's thoughts    in children it's much less so  when they are age five to eight  the age range of the children I just showed you. And actually if we even look at eight to    year olds  getting into early adolescence  they still don't have quite an adult like brain region. And so  what we can see is that over the course of childhood and even into adolescence  both the cognitive system  our mind's ability to think about other minds  and the brain system that supports it are continuing  slowly  to develop. But of course  as you're probably aware  even in adulthood  people differ from one another in how good they are at thinking of other minds  how often they do it and how accurately. And so what we wanted to know was  could differences among adults in how they think about other people's thoughts be explained in terms of differences in this brain region  So  the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids. And I'm going to give that to you now. So Grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory  and they take a break for coffee. And Grace's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee. Grace goes to make the coffee and finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder  which is sugar. But the powder is labeled  Deadly Poison   so Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison. And she puts it in her friend's coffee. And her friend drinks the coffee  and is fine. How many people think it was morally permissible for Grace to put the powder in the coffee  Okay. Good.  Laughter  So we ask people  how much should Grace be blamed in this case  which we call a failed attempt to harm  And we can compare that to another case  where everything in the real world is the same. The powder is still sugar  but what's different is what Grace thinks. Now she thinks the powder is sugar. And perhaps unsurprisingly  if Grace thinks the powder is sugar and puts it in her friend's coffee  people say she deserves no blame at all. Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison  even though it's really sugar  now people say she deserves a lot of blame  even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same. And in fact  they say she deserves more blame in this case  the failed attempt to harm  than in another case  which we call an accident. Where Grace thought the powder was sugar  because it was labeled  sugar  and by the coffee machine  but actually the powder was poison. So even though when the powder was poison  the friend drank the coffee and died  people say Grace deserves less blame in that case  when she innocently thought it was sugar  than in the other case  where she thought it was poison and no harm occurred. People  though  disagree a little bit about exactly how much blame Grace should get in the accident case. Some people think she should deserve more blame  and other people less. And what I'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while they're making that judgment. So what I'm showing you  from left to right  is how much activity there was in this brain region  and from top to bottom  how much blame people said that Grace deserved. And what you can see is  on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region  people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident. Whereas on the right  where there was a lot of activity  people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief  and said she deserved a lot less blame for causing the accident. So that's good  but of course what we'd rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region  and see if we could change people's moral judgment. And we do have such a tool. It's called Trans Cranial Magnetic Stimulation  or TMS. This is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse through somebody's skull  into a small region of their brain  and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region. So I'm going to show you a demo of this. First  I'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse. I'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine. When you hear clicks  we're turning the machine on. So now I'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain  to the part of my brain that controls my hand. So there is no physical force  just a magnetic pulse. Woman  Video   Ready  Rebecca  RS  Yes. Okay  so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain. And we can use that same pulse  now applied to the RTPJ  to ask if we can change people's moral judgments. So these are the judgments I showed you before  people's normal moral judgments. And then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ and ask how people's judgments change. And the first thing is  people can still do this task overall. So their judgments of the case when everything was fine remain the same. They say she deserves no blame. But in the case of a failed attempt to harm  where Grace thought that it was poison  although it was really sugar  people now say it was more okay  she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee. And in the case of the accident  where she thought that it was sugar  but it was really poison and so she caused a death  people say that it was less okay  she deserves more blame. So what I've told you today is that people come  actually  especially well equipped to think about other people's thoughts. We have a special brain system that lets us think about what other people are thinking. This system takes a long time to develop  slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence. And even in adulthood  differences in this brain region can explain differences among adults in how we think about and judge other people. But I want to give the last word back to the novelists  and to Philip Roth  who ended by saying   The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living. Getting them wrong and wrong and wrong  and then on careful reconsideration  getting them wrong again.  Thank you. Chris Anderson  So  I have a question. When you start talking about using magnetic pulses to change people's moral judgments  that sounds alarming. Please tell me that you're not taking phone calls from the Pentagon  say. RS  I'm not. I mean  they're calling  but I'm not taking the call. CA  They really are calling  So then seriously  you must lie awake at night sometimes wondering where this work leads. I mean  you're clearly an incredible human being  but someone could take this knowledge and in some future not torture chamber  do acts that people here might be worried about. RS  Yeah  we worry about this. So  there's a couple of things to say about TMS. One is that you can't be TMSed without knowing it. So it's not a surreptitious technology. It's quite hard  actually  to get those very small changes. The changes I showed you are impressive to me because of what they tell us about the function of the brain  but they're small on the scale of the moral judgments that we actually make. And what we changed was not people's moral judgments when they're deciding what to do  when they're making action choices. We changed their ability to judge other people's actions. And so  I think of what I'm doing not so much as studying the defendant in a criminal trial  but studying the jury. CA  Is your work going to lead to any recommendations in education  to perhaps bring up a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments  RS  That's one of the idealistic hopes. The whole research program here of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new. Until recently  what we knew about the brain were the things that any other animal's brain could do too  so we could study it in animal models. We knew how brains see  and how they control the body and how they hear and sense. And the whole project of understanding how brains do the uniquely human things    learn language and abstract concepts  and thinking about other people's thoughts    that's brand new. And we don't know yet what the implications will be of understanding it. CA  So I've got one last question. There is this thing called the hard problem of consciousness  that puzzles a lot of people. The notion that you can understand why a brain works  perhaps. But why does anyone have to feel anything  Why does it seem to require these beings who sense things for us to operate  You're a brilliant young neuroscientist. I mean  what chances do you think there are that at some time in your career  someone  you or someone else  is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem  RS  I hope they do. And I think they probably won't. CA  Why  RS  It's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing. CA  That's a great answer. Rebecca Saxe  thank you very much. That was fantastic. These are grim economic times  fellow TEDsters  grim economic times indeed. And so  I would like to cheer you up with one of the great  albeit largely unknown  commercial success stories of the past    years. Comparable  in its own very peculiar way  to the achievements of Microsoft or Google. And it's an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity. I refer to organized crime. Now organized crime has been around for a very long time  I hear you say  and these would be wise words  indeed. But in the last two decades  it has experienced an unprecedented expansion  now accounting for roughly    percent of the world's GDP. I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy  or McMafia  for short. So what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross border crime  Well  of course  there is globalization  technology  communications  all that stuff  which we'll talk about a little bit later. But first  I would like to take you back to this event  the collapse of communism. All across Eastern Europe  a most momentous episode in our post war history. Now it's time for full disclosure. This event meant a great deal to me personally. I had started smuggling books across the Iron Curtain to Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe  like Solidarity in Poland  when I was in my teens. I then started writing about Eastern Europe  and eventually I became the BBC's chief correspondent for the region  which is what I was doing in     . And so when     million people finally won the right to choose their own governments  I was ecstatic  but I was also a touch worried about some of the nastier things lurking behind the wall. It wasn't long  for example  before ethnic nationalism reared its bloody head in Yugoslavia. And amongst the chaos  amidst the euphoria  it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wielded power before       in Eastern Europe  continued to do so after the revolutions there. Obviously there were characters like this. But there were also some more unexpected people who played a critical role in what was going on in Eastern Europe. Like this character. Remember these guys  They used to win the gold medals in weightlifting and wrestling  every four years in the Olympics  and they were the great celebrities of communism  with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it. They used to get great apartments in the center of town  casual sex on tap  and they could travel to the West very freely  which was a great luxury at the time. It may come as a surprise  but they played a critical role in the emergence of the market economy in Eastern Europe. Or as I like to call them  they are the midwives of capitalism. Here are some of those same weightlifters after their      makeover. Now in Bulgaria    this photograph was taken in Bulgaria    when communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe  it wasn't just communism  it was the state that collapsed as well. That means your police force wasn't working. The court system wasn't functioning properly. So what was a business man in the brave new world of East European capitalism going to do to make sure that his contracts would be honored  Well  he would turn to people who were called  rather prosaically by sociologists  privatized law enforcement agencies. We prefer to know them as the mafia. And in Bulgaria  the mafia was soon joined with        people who were sacked from their jobs in the security services between      and     . Now  when your state is collapsing  your economy is heading south at a rate of knots  the last people you want coming on to the labor market are        men and women whose chief skills are surveillance  are smuggling  building underground networks and killing people. But that's what happened all over Eastern Europe. Now  when I was working in the     s  I spent most of the time covering the appalling conflict in Yugoslavia. And I couldn't help notice that the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities  the paramilitary organizations  were actually the same people running the organized criminal syndicates. And I came to think that behind the violence lay a sinister criminal enterprise. And so I resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen  by talking to victims  by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services. But above all else  by talking to the gangsters themselves. And the Balkans was a fabulous place to start. Why  Well of course there was the issue of law and order collapsing  but also  as they say in the retail trade  it's location  location  location. And what I noticed at the beginning of my research that the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world. Heroin  cocaine  women being trafficked into prostitution and precious minerals. And where were they heading  The European Union  which by now was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization  transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history  eventually comprising some     million people. And a significant minority of those     million people like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash sleeping with prostitutes  sticking    Euro notes up their nose and employing illegal migrant laborers. Now  organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business. It has zones of production  like Afghanistan and Columbia. It has zones of distribution  like Mexico and the Balkans. And then  of course  it has zones of consumption  like the European Union  Japan and of course  the United States. The zones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world  and they are often threatened by appalling violence and bloodshed. Take Mexico  for example. Six thousand people killed there in the last    months as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade. But what about the Democratic Republic of Congo  Since       five million people have died there. It's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers  but it's the biggest conflict on this planet since the Second World War. And why is it  Because mafias from all around the world cooperate with local paramilitaries in order to seize the supplies of the rich mineral resources of the region. In the year          percent of the world's coltan was sourced to the killing fields of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Now  coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone  in almost every laptop and games console. The Congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia in exchange for weapons  and the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets. And it is this Western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime. Now  let me show you some of my friends in action  caught conveniently on film by the Italian police  and smuggling duty not paid cigarettes. Now  cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap. The European Union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world. So if you can smuggle them into the E.U.  there are very handsome profits to be made  and I want to show you this to demonstrate the type of resources available to these groups. This boat is worth one million Euros when it's new. And it's the fastest thing on European waters. From       for seven years     of these boats made the trip across the Adriatic  from Montenegro to Italy  every single night. And as a consequence of this trade  Britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue. And instead that money went to underwrite the wars in Yugoslavia and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals. Now Italian police  when this trade started  had just two boats which could go at the same speed. And this is very important  because the only way you can catch these guys is if they run out of gas. Sometimes the gangsters would bring with them women being trafficked into prostitution  and if the police intervened  they would hurl the women into the sea so that the police had to go and save them from drowning  rather than chasing the bad guys. So I have shown you this to demonstrate how many boats  how many vessels it takes to catch one of these guys. And the answer is six vessels. And remember     of these speed boats were coming across the Adriatic every single night. So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making  Well  this is where we come to globalization  because that was not just the deregulation of global trade. It was the liberalization of international financial markets. And boy  did that make it easy for the money launderers. The last two decades have been the champagne era for dirty lucre. In the     s  we saw financial centers around the world competing for their business  and there was simply no effective mechanism to prevent money laundering. And a lot of licit banks were also happy to accept deposits from very dubious sources without questions being asked. But at the heart of this  is the offshore banking network. Now these things are an essential part of the money laundering parade  and if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion and transnational organized crime  money laundering  you have to get rid of them. On a positive note  we at last have someone in the White House who has consistently spoken out against these corrosive entities. And if anyone is concerned about what I believe is the necessity for new legislation  regulation  effective regulation  I say  let's take a look at Bernie Madoff  who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail. Bernie Madoff stole    billion dollars. That puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters with the Colombian cartels and the major Russian crime syndicates  but he did this for decades in the very heart of Wall Street  and no regulator picked up on it. So how many other Madoffs are there on Wall Street or in the city of London  fleecing ordinary folk and money laundering  Well I can tell you  it's quite a few of them. Let me go on to the     of international organized crime now. And that is narcotics. Our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning. This one  however  is in central British Columbia where I photographed it. It's one of the tens of thousands of mom and pop grow ops in B.C. which ensure that over five percent of the province's GDP is accounted for by this trade. Now  I was taken by inspector Brian Cantera  of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police  to a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated by the RCMP from the smugglers who are sending it  of course  down south to the United States where there is an insatiable market for B.C. Bud  as it's called  in part because it's marketed as organic  which of course goes down very well in California. Now  even by the police's admission  this makes not a dent in the profits  really  of the major exporters. Since the beginning of globalization  the global narcotics market has expanded enormously. There has  however  been no concomitant increase in the resources available to police forces. This  however  may all be about to change  because something very strange is going on. The United Nations recognized earlier this    it was last month actually    that Canada has become a key area of distribution and production of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs. Interestingly  the market share of heroin and cocaine is going down  because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs. Now that is a game changer  because it shifts production away from the developing world and into the Western world. When that happens  it is a trend which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the West. The drugs policy which we've had in place for    years is long overdue for a very serious rethink  in my opinion. Now  the recession. Well  organized crime has already adapted very well to the recession. Not surprising  the most opportunistic industry in the whole world. And it has no rules to its regulatory system. Except  of course  it has two business risks  arrest by law enforcement  which is  frankly  the least of their worries  and competition from other groups  i.e. a bullet in the back of the head. What they've done is they've shifted their operations. People don't smoke as much dope  or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession. And so instead  they have invaded financial and corporate crime in a big way  but above all  two sectors  and that is counterfeit goods and cybercrime. And it's been terribly successful. I would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle. Or perhaps I should say  more accurately  Se or Pringle. I was introduced to this bit of kit by a Brazilian cybercriminal. We sat in a car on the Avenue Paulista in S o Paulo  together. Hooked it up to my laptop  and within about five minutes he had penetrated the computer security system of a major Brazilian bank. It's really not that difficult. And it's actually much easier because the fascinating thing about cybercrime is that it's not so much the technology. The key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering. Or to use the technical term for it  there's one born every minute. You would not believe how easy it is to persuade people to do things with their computers which are objectively not in their interest. And it was very soon when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this  of course  the quickest way to a person's wallet is through the promise of sex and love. I expect some of you remember the ILOVEYOU virus  one of the very great worldwide viruses that came. I was very fortunate when the ILOVEYOU virus came out  because the first person I received it from was an ex girlfriend of mine. Now  she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time  but love was not amongst them. And so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox  I dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin and spared myself a very nasty infection. So  cybercrime  do watch out for it. One thing that we do know that the Internet is doing is the Internet is assisting these guys. These are mosquitos who carry the malarial parasite which infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal at our expense. Now  Artesunate is a very effective drug at destroying the parasite in the early days of infection. But over the past year or so  researchers in Cambodia have discovered that what's happening is the malarial parasite is developing a resistance. And they fear that the reason why it's developing a resistance is because Cambodians can't afford the drugs on the commercial market  and so they buy it from the Internet. And these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient. Which is why the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance. The reason I say this is because we have to know that organized crime impacts all sorts of areas of our lives. You don't have to sleep with prostitutes or take drugs in order to have a relationship with organized crime. They affect our bank accounts. They affect our communications  our pension funds. They even affect the food that we eat and our governments. This is no longer an issue of Sicilians from Palermo and New York. There is no romance involved with gangsters in the   st Century. This is a mighty industry  and it creates instability and violence wherever it goes. It is a major economic force and we need to take it very  very seriously. It's been a privilege talking to you. Thank you very much. The public debate about architecture quite often just stays on contemplating the final result  the architectural object. Is the latest tower in London a gherkin or a sausage or a sex tool  So recently  we asked ourselves if we could invent a format that could actually tell the stories behind the projects  maybe combining images and drawings and words to actually sort of tell stories about architecture. And we discovered that we didn't have to invent it  it already existed in the form of a comic book. So we basically copied the format of the comic book to actually tell the stories of behind the scenes  how our projects actually evolve through adaptation and improvisation. Sort of through the turmoil and the opportunities and the incidents of the real world. We call this comic book  Yes is More   which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes. In this case it's Mies van der Rohe's Less is More. He triggered the modernist revolution. After him followed the post modern counter revolution  Robert Venturi saying   Less is a bore.  After him  Philip Johnson sort of introduced you could say promiscuity  or at least openness to new ideas with   I am a whore.  Recently  Obama has introduced optimism at a sort of time of global financial crisis. And what we'd like to say with  Yes is More  is basically trying to question this idea that the architectural avant garde is almost always negatively defined  as who or what we are against. The cliche of the radical architect is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment. Or this idea of the misunderstood genius  frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas. Rather than revolution  we're much more interested in evolution  this idea that things gradually evolve by adapting and improvising to the changes of the world. In fact  I actually think that Darwin is one of the people who best explains our design process. His famous evolutionary tree could almost be a diagram of the way we work. As you can see  a project evolves through a series of generations of design meetings. At each meeting  there's way too many ideas. Only the best ones can survive. And through a process of architectural selection  we might choose a really beautiful model or we might have a very functional model. We mate them. They have sort of mutant offspring. And through these sort of generations of design meetings we arrive at a design. A very literal way of showing it is a project we did for a library and a hotel in Copenhagen. The design process was really tough  almost like a struggle for survival  but gradually an idea evolved  this sort of idea of a rational tower that melts together with the surrounding city  sort of expanding the public space onto what we refer to as a Scandinavian version of the Spanish Steps in Rome  but sort of public on the outside  as well as on the inside  with the library. But Darwin doesn't only explain the evolution of a single idea. As you can see  sometimes a subspecies branches off. And quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that there is this great idea. It doesn't really work in this context. But for another client in another culture  it could really be the right answer to a different question. So as a result  we never throw anything out. We keep our office almost like an archive of architectural biodiversity. You never know when you might need it. And what I'd like to do now  in an act of warp speed storytelling  is tell the story of how two projects evolved by adapting and improvising to the happenstance of the world. The first story starts last year when we went to Shanghai to do the competition for the Danish National Pavilion for the World Expo in     . And we saw this guy  Haibao. He's the mascot of the expo  and he looks strangely familiar. In fact he looked like a building we had designed for a hotel in the north of Sweden. When we submitted it for the Swedish competition we thought it was a really cool scheme  but it didn't exactly look like something from the north of Sweden. The Swedish jury didn't think so either. So we lost. But then we had a meeting with a Chinese businessman who saw our design and said   Wow  that's the Chinese character for the word 'people.'  So  apparently this is how you write  people   as in the People's Republic of China. We even double checked. And at the same time  we got invited to exhibit at the Shanghai Creative Industry Week. So we thought like  this is too much of an opportunity  so we hired a feng shui master. We scaled the building up three times to Chinese proportions  and went to China. So the People's Building  as we called it. This is our two interpreters  sort of reading the architecture. It went on the cover of the Wen Wei Po newspaper  which got Mr. Liangyu Chen  the mayor of Shanghai  to visit the exhibition. And we had the chance to explain the project. And he said   Shanghai is the city in the world with most skyscrapers   but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over. And with the People's Building  he saw an architecture that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of China and the progressive future of China. So we obviously profoundly agreed with him. Unfortunately  Mr. Chen is now in prison for corruption. But like I said  Haibao looked very familiar  because he is actually the Chinese character for  people.  And they chose this mascot because the theme of the expo is  Better City  Better Life.  Sustainability. And we thought  sustainability has grown into being this sort of neo Protestant idea that it has to hurt in order to do good. You know  you're not supposed to take long  warm showers. You're not supposed to fly on holidays because it's bad for the environment. Gradually  you get this idea that sustainable life is less fun than normal life. So we thought that maybe it could be interesting to focus on examples where a sustainable city actually increases the quality of life. We also asked ourselves  what could Denmark possibly show China that would be relevant  You know  it's one of the biggest countries in the world  one of the smallest. China symbolized by the dragon. Denmark  we have a national bird  the swan. China has many great poets  but we discovered that in the People's Republic public school curriculum  they have three fairy tales by An Tu Sheng  or Hans Christian Anderson  as we call him. So that means that all  .  billion Chinese have grown up with  The Emperor's New Clothes    The Matchstick Girl  and  The Little Mermaid.  It's almost like a fragment of Danish culture integrated into Chinese culture. The biggest tourist attraction in China is the Great Wall. The Great Wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon. The big tourist attraction in Denmark is The Little Mermaid. That can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours. And it sort of shows the difference between these two cities. Copenhagen  Shanghai  modern  European. But then we looked at recent urban development  and we noticed that this is like a Shanghai street     years ago. All bikes  no cars. This is how it looks today  all traffic jam. Bicycles have become forbidden many places. Meanwhile  in Copenhagen we're actually expanding the bicycle lanes. A third of all the people commute by bike. We have a free system of bicycles called the City Bike that you can borrow if you visit the city. So we thought  why don't we reintroduce the bicycle in China  We donate       bikes to Shanghai. So if you come to the expo  go straight to the Danish pavilion  get a Danish bike  and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions. Like I said  Shanghai and Copenhagen are both port cities  but in Copenhagen the water has gotten so clean that you can actually swim in it. One of the first projects we ever did was the harbor bath in Copenhagen  sort of continuing the public realm into the water. So we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of state financed propaganda  images  statements  but no real experience. So just like with a bike  we don't talk about it. You can try it. Like with the water  instead of talking about it  we're going to sail a million liters of harbor water from Copenhagen to Shanghai  so the Chinese who have the courage can actually dive in and feel how clean it is. This is where people normally object that it doesn't sound very sustainable to sail water from Copenhagen to China. But in fact  the container ships go full of goods from China to Denmark  and then they sail empty back. So quite often you load water for ballast. So we can actually hitch a ride for free. And in the middle of this sort of harbor bath  we're actually going to put the actual Little Mermaid. So the real Mermaid  the real water  and the real bikes. And when she's gone  we're going to invite a Chinese artist to reinterpret her. The architecture of the pavilion is this sort of loop of exhibition and bikes. When you go to the exhibition  you'll see the Mermaid and the pool. You'll walk around  start looking for a bicycle on the roof  jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo. So when we actually won the competition we had to do an exhibition in China explaining the project. And to our surprise we got one of our boards back with corrections from the Chinese state censorship. The first thing  the China map missed Taiwan. It's a very serious political issue in China. We will add on. The second thing  we had compared the swan to the dragon  and then the Chinese state said   Suggest change to panda.  So  when it came out in Denmark that we were actually going to move our national monument  the National People's Party sort of rebelled against it. They tried to pass a law against moving the Mermaid. So for the first time  I got invited to speak at the National Parliament. It was kind of interesting because in the morning  from   to     they were discussing the bailout package    how many billions to invest in saving the Danish economy. And then at    o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues. And then from    to    they were debating whether or not to send the Mermaid to China. But to conclude  if you want to see the Mermaid from May to December next year  don't come to Copenhagen  because she's going to be in Shanghai. If you do come to Copenhagen  you will probably see an installation by Ai Weiwei  the Chinese artist. But if the Chinese government intervenes  it might even be a panda. So the second story that I'd like to tell is  actually starts in my own house. This is my apartment. This is the view from my apartment  over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies that our client called the Leonardo DiCaprio balcony. And they form this sort of vertical backyard where  on a nice summer day  you'll actually get introduced to all your neighbors in a vertical radius of    meters. The house is sort of a distortion of a square block. Trying to zigzag it to make sure that all of the apartments look at the straight views  instead of into each other. Until recently  this was the view from my apartment  onto this place where our client actually bought the neighbor site. And he said that he was going to do an apartment block next to a parking structure. And we thought  rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments looking straight into a big boring block of cars  why don't we turn all the apartments into penthouses  put them on a podium of cars. And because Copenhagen is completely flat  if you want to have a nice south facing slope with a view  you basically have to do it yourself. Then we sort of cut up the volume  so we wouldn't block the view from my apartment. And essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space underneath the apartments. And up in the sun  you have a single layer of apartments that combine all the splendors of a suburban lifestyle  like a house with a garden with a sort of metropolitan view  and a sort of dense urban location. This is our first architectural model. This is an aerial photo taken last summer. And essentially  the apartments cover the parking. They are accessed through this diagonal elevator. It's actually a stand up product from Switzerland  because in Switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators. And the facade of the parking  we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated  so we needed to perforate it. And we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes  we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic  naturally ventilated  rasterized image. And since we always refer to the project as The Mountain  we commissioned this Japanese Himalaya photographer to give us this beautiful photo of Mount Everest  making the entire building a       square meter artwork. So if you go back into the parking  into the corridors  it's almost like traveling into a parallel universe from cars and colors  into this sort of south facing urban oasis. The wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades. If you go even further  it turns into this green garden. And all the rainwater that drops on the Mountain is actually accumulated. And there is an automatic irrigation system that makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens  in one or two years it will sort of transform into a Cambodian temple ruin  completely covered in green. So  the Mountain is like our first built example of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy. This idea that you can actually create  if not gold  then at least added value by mixing traditional ingredients  like normal apartments and normal parking  and in this case actually offer people the chance that they don't have to choose between a life with a garden or a life in the city. They can actually have both. As an architect  it's really hard to set the agenda. You can't just say that now I'd like to do a sustainable city in central Asia  because that's not really how you get commissions. You always have to sort of adapt and improvise to the opportunities and accidents that happen  and the sort of turmoil of the world. One last example is that recently we  like last summer  we won the competition to design a Nordic national bank. This was the director of the bank when he was still smiling. It was in the middle of the capital so we were really excited by this opportunity. Unfortunately  it was the national bank of Iceland. At the same time  we actually had a visitor    a minister from Azerbaijan came to our office. We took him to see the Mountain. And he got very excited by this idea that you could actually make mountains out of architecture  because Azerbaijan is known as the Alps of Central Asia. So he asked us if we could actually imagine an urban master plan on an island outside the capital that would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains of Azerbaijan. So we took the commission. And we made this small movie that I'd like to show. We quite often make little movies. We always argue a lot about the soundtrack  but in this case it was really easy to choose the song. So basically  Baku is this sort of crescent bay overlooking the island of Zira  the island that we are planning    almost like the diagram of their flag. And our main idea was to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains of the topography of Azerbaijan and reinterpret them into urban and architectural structures  inhabitable of human life. Then we place these mountains on the island  surrounding this sort of central green valley  almost like a central park. And what makes it interesting is that the island right now is just a piece of desert. It has no vegetation. It has no water. It has no energy  no resources. So we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem  exploiting wind energy to drive the desalination plants  and to use the thermal properties of water to heat and cool the buildings. And all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater is filtered organically into the landscape  gradually transforming the desert island into sort of a green  lush landscape. So  you can say where an urban development normally happens at the expense of nature  in this case it's actually creating nature. And the buildings  they don't only sort of invoke the imagery of the mountains  they also operate like mountains. They create shelter from the wind. They accumulate the solar energy. They accumulate the water. So they actually transform the entire island into a single ecosystem. So we recently presented the master plan  and it has gotten approved. And this summer we are starting the construction documents of the two first mountains  in what's going to be the first carbon neutral island in Central Asia. Yes  maybe just to round off. So in a way you can see how the Mountain in Copenhagen sort of evolved into the Seven Peaks of Azerbaijan. With a little luck and some more evolution  maybe in    years it could be the Five Mountains on Mars. Thank you. So the question is  what is invisible  There is more of it than you think  actually. Everything  I would say. Everything that matters except every thing and except matter. We can see matter. But we can't see what's the matter. As in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently   The marriage suffered a setback in       when the husband was killed by the wife.  There's a world of invisibility there  isn't there  So  we can see the stars and the planets  but we can't see what holds them apart or what draws them together. With matter  as with people  we see only the skin of things. We can't see into the engine room. We can't see what makes people tick  at least not without difficulty. And the closer we look at anything  the more it disappears. In fact  if you look really closely at stuff  if you look at the basic substructure of matter  there isn't anything there. Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz  and there is only energy. And you can't see energy. So everything that matters  that's important  is invisible. One slightly silly thing that's invisible is this story  which is invisible to you. And I'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds. It's about an M.P. called Geoffrey Dickens. The late Geoffrey Dickens  M.P. was attending a fete in his constituency. Wherever he went  at every stall he stopped he was closely followed by a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness. Try as he might  he couldn't get away from her. A few days later he received a letter from a constituent saying how much she admired him  had met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph. After her name  written in brackets was the apt description  horse face.  I've misjudged this women   thought Mr. Dickens.  Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness  she turns it to her advantage. A photo is not enough.  So he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in. And on the photograph  he wrote with a flourish   To Horse Face  with love from Geoffrey Dickens  M.P.  After it had been sent off  his secretary said to him   Did you get that letter from the woman at the fete  I wrote Horse Face on her  so you'd remember who she was.  I bet he thought he wished he was invisible  don't you  So  one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can't see we also can't understand. Gravity is one thing that we can't see and which we don't understand. It's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces  and the weakest. And nobody really knows what it is or why it's there. For what it's worth  Sir Isaac Newton  the greatest scientist who ever lived  he thought Jesus came to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity. That's what he thought he was there for. So  bright guy  could be wrong on that one  I don't know. Consciousness. I see all your faces. I have no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing  Isn't that incredible that we can't read each other's minds  But we can touch each other  taste each other perhaps  if we get close enough. But we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing. In the Sufi faith  this great Middle Eastern religion  which some claim is the route of all religions  Sufi masters are all telepaths  so they say. But their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist. So that's why we don't think it exists  the Sufi masters working on us. In the question of consciousness and artificial intelligence  artificial intelligence has really  like the study of consciousness  gotten nowhere. We have no idea how consciousness works. With artificial intelligence  not only have they not created artificial intelligence  they haven't yet created artificial stupidity. The laws of physics  invisible  eternal  omnipresent  all powerful. Remind you of anyone  Interesting. I'm  as you can guess  not a materialist  I'm an immaterialist. And I've found a very useful new word  ignostic. Okay  I'm an ignostic. I refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists  until somebody properly defines the terms. Another thing we can't see is the human genome. And this is increasingly peculiar  because about    years ago  when they started delving into the genome  they thought it would probably contain around         genes. Geneticists will know this  but every year since  it's been revised downwards. We now think there are likely to be only just over        genes in the human genome. This is extraordinary. Because rice    get this    rice is known to have    thousand genes. Potatoes  potatoes have    chromosomes. Do you know that  Two more than people  and the same as a gorilla. You can't see these things  but they are very strange. The stars by day. I always think that's fascinating. The universe disappears. The more light there is  the less you can see. Time  nobody can see time. I don't know if you know this. Modern physics  there is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist  because it's too inconvenient for the figures. It's much easier if it's not really there. You can't see the future  obviously. And you can't see the past  except in your memory. One of the interesting things about the past is you particularly can't see. My son asked me this the other day  he said   Dad  can you remember what I was like when I was two   And I said   Yes.  And he said   Why can't I   Isn't that extraordinary  You cannot remember what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three  which is great news for psychoanalysts  because otherwise they'd be out of a job. Because that's where all the stuff happens that makes you who you are. Another thing you can't see is the grid on which we hang. This is fascinating. You probably know  some of you  that cells are continually renewed. You can see it in skin and this kind of stuff. Skin flakes off  hairs grow  nails  that kind of stuff. But every cell in your body is replaced at some point. Taste buds  every    days or so. Livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer. A spine takes several years. But at the end of seven years  not one cell in your body remains from what was there seven years ago. The question is  who  then  are we  What are we  What is this thing that we hang on  that is actually us  Okay. Atoms  you can't see them. Nobody ever will. They're smaller than the wavelength of light. Gas  you can't see that. Interesting. Somebody mentioned      recently. Gas was invented in      by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont. It's said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by a known individual. Quite good. He also invented a word called  blas   meaning astral radiation. Didn't catch on  unfortunately. But well done  him. There is so many things that    Light. You can't see light. When it's dark  in a vacuum  if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes  you won't see it. Slightly technical  some physicists will disagree with this. But it's odd that you can't see the beam of light  you can only see what it hits. I find that extraordinary  not to be able to see light  not to be able to see darkness. Electricity  you can't see that. Don't let anyone tell you they understand electricity. They don't. Nobody knows what it is. You probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire  don't you  at the speed of light when you turn the light on. They don't. Electrons bumble down the wire  about the speed of spreading honey  they say. Galaxies      billion of them estimated in the universe.     billion. How many can we see  Five. Five out of the     billion galaxies  with the naked eye  and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight. Radio waves. There's another thing. Heinrich Hertz  when he discovered radio waves in       he called them radio waves because they radiated. And somebody said to him   Well what's the point of these  Heinrich  What's the point of these radio waves that you've found   And he said   Well  I've no idea. But I guess somebody will find a use for them someday.  And that's what they do  radio. That's what they discovered. Anyway  so the biggest thing that's invisible to us is what we don't know. It is incredible how little we know. Thomas Edison once said   We don't know one percent of one millionth about anything.  And I've come to the conclusion    because you've asked this other question   What's another thing you can't see   The point  most of us. What's the point  You can't see a point. It's by definition dimensionless  like an electron  oddly enough. But the point  what I've got it down to  is there are only two questions really worth asking.  Why are we here   and  What should we do about it while we are  And to help you  I've got two things to leave you with  from two great philosophers  perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the   th century  one a mathematician and an engineer  and the other a poet. The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein who said   I don't know why we are here. But I'm pretty sure it's not in order to enjoy ourselves.  He was a cheerful bastard wasn't he  And secondly and lastly  W.H. Auden  one of my favorite poets  who said   We are here on earth to help others. What the others are here for  I've no idea.  We see with the eyes  but we see with the brain as well. And seeing with the brain is often called imagination. And we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination  our inscapes.  We've lived with them all our lives. But there are also hallucinations as well  and hallucinations  are completely different. They don't seem to be of our creation. They don't seem to be under our control. They seem to come from the outside  and to mimic perception. So I am going to be talking about hallucinations  and a particular sort of visual hallucination which I see among my patients. A few months ago  I got a phone call from a nursing home where I work. They told me that one of their residents  an old lady in her   s  was seeing things  and they wondered if she'd gone bonkers or  because she was an old lady  whether she'd had a stroke  or whether she had Alzheimer's. And so they asked me if I would come and see Rosalie  the old lady. I went in to see her. It was evident straight away that she was perfectly sane and lucid and  of good intelligence  but she'd been very startled and very bewildered  because she'd been seeing things. And she told me    the nurses hadn't mentioned this    that she was blind  that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years. But now  for the last few days  she'd been seeing things. So I said   What sort of things   And she said   People in Eastern dress  in drapes  walking up and down stairs. A man who turns towards me and smiles. But he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth. Animals too. I see a white building. It's snowing  a soft snow. I see this horse with a harness  dragging the snow away. Then  one night  the scene changes. I see cats and dogs walking towards me. They come to a certain point and then stop. Then it changes again. I see a lot of children. They are walking up and down stairs. They wear bright colors  rose and blue  like Eastern dress.  Sometimes  she said  before the people come on  she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor  which seem to go up to the ceiling. I said   Is this like a dream   And she said   No  it's not like a dream. It's like a movie.  She said   It's got color. It's got motion. But it's completely silent  like a silent movie.  And she said that it's a rather boring movie. She said   All these people with Eastern dress  walking up and down  very repetitive  very limited.  And she has a sense of humor. She knew it was a hallucination. But she was frightened. She'd lived    years and she'd never had a hallucination before. She said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing  that they seemed to come on by themselves  or disappear. She had no control over them. She said she didn't recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations. And none of the people or the animals  well  they all seemed oblivious of her. And she didn't know what was going on. She wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind. Well  I examined her carefully. She was a bright old lady  perfectly sane. She had no medical problems. She wasn't on any medications which could produce hallucinations. But she was blind. And I then said to her   I think I know what you have.  I said   There is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness. This was originally described   I said   right back in the   th century  by a man called Charles Bonnet. And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome. There is nothing wrong with your brain. There is nothing wrong with your mind. You have Charles Bonnet syndrome.  And she was very relieved at this  that there was nothing seriously the matter  and also rather curious. She said   Who is this Charles Bonnet   She said   Did he have them himself   And she said   Tell all the nurses that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome.   I'm not crazy. I'm not demented. I have Charles Bonnet syndrome.  Well  so I did tell the nurses. Now this  for me  is a common situation. I work in old age homes  largely. I see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired. About    percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations. And about    percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations. You don't have to be completely blind  only sufficiently impaired. Now with the original description in the   th century  Charles Bonnet did not have them. His grandfather had these hallucinations. His grandfather was a magistrate  an elderly man. He'd had cataract surgery. His vision was pretty poor. And in       he described to his grandson various things he was seeing. The first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair. It was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles. And he knew it was a hallucination. You don't have handkerchiefs in midair. And then he saw a big wheel in midair. But sometimes he wasn't sure whether he was hallucinating or not  because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions. So on one occasion  when his granddaughters were visiting them  he said   And who are these handsome young men with you   And they said   Alas  Grandpapa  there are no handsome young men.  And then the handsome young men disappeared. It's typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash. They don't usually fade in and out. They are rather sudden  and they change suddenly. Charles Lullin  the grandfather  saw hundreds of different figures  different landscapes of all sorts. On one occasion  he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe  and realized it was himself. That was the only figure he recognized. On one occasion when he was walking in the streets of Paris  he saw    this was real    a scaffolding. But when he got back home  he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high  on his study table. This repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia. With him and with Rosalie  what seems to be going on    and Rosalie said   What's going on      and I said that as you lose vision  as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input  they become hyperactive and excitable  and they start to fire spontaneously. And you start to see things. The things you see can be very complicated indeed. With another patient of mine  who  also had some vision  the vision she had could be disturbing. On one occasion  she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant. And he turned around. And then he divided into six figures in striped shirts  who started walking towards her. And then the six figures came together again  like a concertina. Once  when she was driving  or rather  her husband was driving  the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads. She had very mobile hallucinations as well. A lot of them had to do with a car. Sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car. He was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned. And then when they came to a stop  the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff      foot in the air  and then disappear. Another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination. This was a woman who didn't have trouble with her eyes  but the visual parts of her brain  a little tumor in the occipital cortex. And  above all  she would see cartoons. These cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field  like a screen. And especially she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog. Now  I don't watch Sesame Street  but she made a point of saying   Why Kermit   she said   Kermit the Frog means nothing to me. You know  I was wondering about Freudian determinants. Why Kermit  Kermit the Frog means nothing to me.  She didn't mind the cartoons too much. But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with Rosalie  the faces were often deformed  with very large teeth or very large eyes. And these frightened her. Well  what is going on with these people  As a physician  I have to try and define what's going on  and to reassure people  especially to reassure them that they're not going insane. Something like    percent  as I said  of visually impaired people get these. But no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them  because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something. And if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed. In particular  the notion is that if you see things or hear things  you're going mad  but the psychotic hallucinations  are quite different. Psychotic hallucinations  whether they are visual or vocal  they address you. They accuse you. They seduce you. They humiliate you. They jeer at you. You interact with them. There is none of this quality of being addressed with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations. There is a film. You're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you  or that's how people think about it. There is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy  and sometimes  if one has this  one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past. You're at a particular road junction. You smell chestnuts roasting. You hear the traffic. All the senses are involved. And you're waiting for your girl. And it's that Tuesday evening back in     . And the temporal lobe hallucinations are all sense hallucinations  full of feeling  full of familiarity  located in space and time  coherent  dramatic. The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different. So in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations  you have all sorts of levels  from the geometrical hallucinations    the pink and blue squares the woman had    up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces. Faces  and sometimes deformed faces  are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations. And one of the second commonest is cartoons. So  what is going on  Fascinatingly  in the last few years  it's been possible to do functional brain imagery  to do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating. And in fact  to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating. When people have these simple geometrical hallucinations  the primary visual cortex is activated. This is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns. You don't form images with your primary visual cortex. When images are formed  a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe. And in particular  one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus. And it's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus  they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces. But if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus  they may hallucinate faces  and this is exactly what you find in some of these people. There is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented  and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations. There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons. It's activated when one recognizes cartoons  when one draws cartoons  and when one hallucinates them. It's very interesting that that should be specific. There are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes. Around       it was found that there were not only parts of the brain  but particular cells.  Face cells  were discovered around     . And now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells  which can be very  very specific. So you may not only have  car  cells  you may have  Aston Martin  cells. I saw an Aston Martin this morning. I had to bring it in. And now it's in there somewhere. Now  at this level  in what's called the inferotemporal cortex  there are only visual images  or figments or fragments. It's only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion. And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome  you don't go to those higher levels. You're in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images  or figments  or fragmentary figments  all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells. Normally these are all part of the integrated stream of perception  or imagination  and one is not conscious of them. It is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted. And instead of getting normal perception  you're getting an anarchic  convulsive stimulation  or release  of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex. So  suddenly you see a face. Suddenly you see a car. Suddenly this  and suddenly that. The mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this  but not terribly successfully. When these were first described  it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams. But in fact people say   I don't recognize the people. I can't form any associations.   Kermit means nothing to me.  You don't get anywhere thinking of them as dreams. Well  I've more or less said what I wanted. I think I just want to recapitulate and say this is common. Think of the number of blind people. There must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations  but are too scared to mention them. So this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice  for patients  for doctors  for the public. Finally  I think they are infinitely interesting and valuable  for giving one some insight as to how the brain works. Charles Bonnet said      years ago    he wondered how  thinking these hallucinations  how  as he put it  the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain. Now      years later  I think we're beginning to glimpse how this is done. Thanks very much. Chris Anderson  That was superb. Thank you so much. You speak about these things with so much insight and empathy for your patients. Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about  Oliver Sacks  I was afraid you'd ask that. Well  yeah  a lot of them. And actually I'm a little visually impaired myself. I'm blind in one eye  and not terribly good in the other. And I see the geometrical hallucinations. But they stop there. CA  And they don't disturb you  Because you understand what's doing it  it doesn't make you worried  OS  Well they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus  which I ignore. They occasionally interest me  and I have many pictures of them in my notebooks. I've gone and had an fMRI myself  to see how my visual cortex is taking over. And when I see all these hexagons and complex things  which I also have  in visual migraine  I wonder whether everyone sees things like this  and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit. CA  That was an utterly  utterly fascinating talk. Thank you so much for sharing. OS  Thank you. Thank you. My name is Jonathan Zittrain  and in my recent work I've been a bit of a pessimist. So I thought this morning I would try to be the optimist  and give reason to hope for the future of the Internet by drawing upon its present. Now  it may seem like there is less hope today than there was before. People are less kind. There is less trust around. I don't know. As a simple example  we could run a test here. How many people have ever hitchhiked  I know. How many people have hitchhiked within the past    years  Right. So what has changed  It's not better public transportation. So that's one reason to think that we might be declensionists  going in the wrong direction. But I want to give you three examples to try to say that the trend line is in fact in the other direction  and it's the Internet helping it along. So example number one  the Internet itself. These are three of the founders of the Internet. They were actually high school classmates together at the same high school in suburban Los Angles in the     s. You might have had a French club or a Debate club. They had a  Let's build a global network  club  and it worked out very well. They are pictured here for their   th anniversary Newsweek retrospective on the Internet. And as you can tell  they are basically goof balls. They had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network. The limitation was that they didn't have any money. No particular amount of capital to invest  of the sort that for a physical network you might need for trucks and people and a hub to move packages around overnight. They had none of that. But they had an amazing freedom  which was they didn't have to make any money from it. The Internet has no business plan  never did. No CEO  no firm responsible  singly  for building it. Instead  it's folks getting together to do something for fun  rather than because they were told to  or because they were expecting to make a mint off of it. That ethos led to a network architecture  a structure that was unlike other digital networks then or since. So unusual  in fact  that it was said that it's not clear the Internet could work. As late as       IBM was known to say you couldn't possibly build a corporate network using Internet Protocol. And even some Internet engineers today say the whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out. That's why the mascot of Internet engineering  if it had one  is said to be the bumblebee. Because the fur to wingspan ratio of the bumblebee is far too large for it to be able to fly. And yet  mysteriously  somehow the bee flies. I'm pleased to say that  thanks to massive government funding  about three years ago we finally figured out how bees fly. It's very complicated  but it turns out they flap their wings very quickly. So what is this bizarre architecture configuration that makes the network sing and be so unusual  Well  to move data around from one place to another    again  it's not like a package courier. It's more like a mosh pit. Imagine  you being part of a network where  you're maybe at a sporting event  and you're sitting in rows like this  and somebody asks for a beer  and it gets handed at the aisle. And your neighborly duty is to pass the beer along  at risk to your own trousers  to get it to the destination. No one pays you to do this. It's just part of your neighborly duty. And  in a way  that's exactly how packets move around the Internet  sometimes in as many as    or    hops  with the intervening entities that are passing the data around having no particular contractual or legal obligation to the original sender or to the receiver. Now  of course  in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination. You need a lot of trust  but it's not like   I'm trying to get to Pensacola  please.  So the Internet needs addressing and directions. It turns out there is no one overall map of the Internet. Instead  again  it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater  but we can only see amidst the fog the people immediately around us. So what do we do to figure out who is where  We turn to the person on the right  and we tell that person what we see on our left  and vice versa. And they can lather  rinse  repeat. And before you know it  you have a general sense of where everything is. This is how Internet addressing and routing actually work. This is a system that relies on kindness and trust  which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable. In rare but striking instances  a single lie told by just one entity in this honeycomb can lead to real trouble. So  for example  last year  the government of Pakistan asked its Internet service providers there to prevent citizens of Pakistan from seeing YouTube. There was a video there that the government did not like and they wanted to make sure it was blocked. This is a common occurrence. Governments everywhere are often trying to block and filter and censor content on the Internet. Well this one ISP in Pakistan chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers in a rather unusual way. It advertised    the way that you might be asked  if you were part of the Internet  to declare what you see near you    it advertised that near it  in fact  it had suddenly awakened to find that it was YouTube.  That's right   it said   I am YouTube.  Which meant that packets of data from subscribers going to YouTube stopped at the ISP  since they thought they were already there  and the ISP threw them away unopened because the point was to block it. But it didn't stop there. You see  that announcement went one click out  which got reverberated  one click out. And it turns out that as you look at the postmortem of this event  you have at one moment perfectly working YouTube. Then  at moment number two  you have the fake announcement go out. And within two minutes  it reverberates around and YouTube is blocked everywhere in the world. If you were sitting in Oxford  England  trying to get to YouTube  your packets were going to Pakistan and they weren't coming back. Now just think about that. One of the most popular websites in the world  run by the most powerful company in the world  and there was nothing that YouTube or Google were particularly privileged to do about it. And yet  somehow  within about two hours  the problem was fixed. How did this happen  Well  for a big clue  we turn to NANOG. The North American Network Operators Group  a group of people who  on a beautiful day outside  enter into a windowless room  at their terminals reading email and messages in fixed proportion font  like this  and they talk about networks. And some of them are mid level employees at Internet service providers around the world. And here is the message where one of them says   Looks like we've got a live one. We have a hijacking of YouTube  This is not a drill. It's not just the cluelessness of YouTube engineers. I promise. Something is up in Pakistan.  And they came together to help find the problem and fix it. So it's kind of like if your house catches on fire. The bad news is there is no fire brigade. The good news is random people apparate from nowhere  put out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise. I was trying to think of the right model to describe this form of random acts of kindness by geeky strangers. You know  it's just like the hail goes out and people are ready to help. And it turns out this model is everywhere  once you start looking for it. Example number two  Wikipedia. If a man named Jimbo came up to you in      and said   I've got a great idea  We start with seven articles that anybody can edit anything  at any time  and we'll get a great encyclopedia  Eh   Right. Dumbest idea ever. In fact  Wikipedia is an idea so profoundly stupid that even Jimbo never had it. Jimbo's idea was for Nupedia. It was going to be totally traditional. He would pay people money because he was feeling like a good guy  and the money would go to the people and they would write the articles. The wiki was introduced so others could make suggestions on edits    as almost an afterthought  a back room. And then it turns out the back room grew to encompass the entire project. And today  Wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can now find it on Chinese restaurant menus. I am not making this up. I have a theory I can explain later. Suffice it to say for now that I prefer my Wikipedia stir fried with pimentos. But now  Wikipedia doesn't just spontaneously work. How does it really work  It turns out there is a back room that is kind of windowless  metaphorically speaking. And there are a bunch of people who  on a sunny day  would rather be inside and monitoring this  the administrator's notice board  itself a wiki page that anyone can edit. And you just bring your problems to the page. It's reminiscent of the description of history as  one damn thing after another   right  Number one   Tendentious editing by user Andyvphil.  Apologies  Andyvphil  if you're here today. I'm not taking sides.  Anon attacking me for reverting.  Here is my favorite   A long story.  It turns out there are more people checking this page for problems and wanting to solve them than there are problems arising on the page. And that's what keeps Wikipedia afloat. At all times  Wikipedia is approximately    minutes away from utter destruction. Right  There are spambots crawling it  trying to turn every article into an ad for a Rolex watch. It's this thin geeky line that keeps it going. Not because it's a job  not because it's a career  but because it's a calling. It's something they feel impelled to do because they care about it. They even gather together in such groups as the Counter Vandalism Unit     Civility  Maturity  Responsibility     to just clean up the pages. It does make you wonder if there were  for instance  a massive  extremely popular Star Trek convention one weekend  who would be minding the store  So what we see    what we see in this phenomenon is something that the crazed  late traffic engineer Hans Monderman discovered in the Netherlands  and here in South Kensington  that sometimes if you remove some of the external rules and signs and everything else  you can actually end up with a safer environment in which people can function  and one in which they are more human with each other. They're realizing that they have to take responsibility for what they do. And Wikipedia has embraced this. Some of you may remember Star Wars Kid  the poor teenager who filmed himself with a golf ball retriever  acting as if it were a light saber. The film  without his permission or even knowledge at first  found its way onto the Internet. Hugely viral video. Extremely popular. Totally mortifying to him. Now  it being encyclopedic and all  Wikipedia had to do an article about Star Wars Kid. Every article on Wikipedia has a corresponding discussion page  and on the discussion page they had extensive argument among the Wikipedians as to whether to have his real name featured in the article. You could see arguments on both sides. Here is just a snapshot of some of them. They eventually decided    not unanimously by any means    not to include his real name  despite the fact that nearly all media reports did. They just didn't think it was the right thing to do. It was an act of kindness. And to this day  the page for Star Wars Kid has a warning right at the top that says you are not to put his real name on the page. If you do  it will be removed immediately  removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision  but respect the outcome and work to make it stay because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion. As a lawyer  I've got to say these guys are inventing the law and stare decisis and stuff like that as they go along. Now  this isn't just limited to Wikipedia. We see it on blogs all over the place. I mean  this is a      Business Week cover. Wow. Blogs are going to change your business. I know they look silly. And sure they look silly. They start off on all sorts of goofy projects. This is my favorite goofy blog  Catsthatlooklikehitler.com. You send in a picture of your cat if it looks like Hitler. Yeah  I know. Number four  it's like  can you imagine coming home to that cat everyday  But then  you can see the same kind of whimsy applied to people. So this is a blog devoted to unfortunate portraiture. This one says   Bucolic meadow with split rail fence. Is that an animal carcass behind her   You're like   You know  I think that's an animal carcass behind her.  And it's one after the other. But then you hit this one. Image removed at request of owner. That's it. Image removed at request of owner. It turns out that somebody lampooned here wrote to the snarky guy that does the site  not with a legal threat  not with an offer of payment  but just said   Hey  would you mind   The person said   No  that's fine.  I believe we can build architectures online to make such human requests that much easier to do  to make it possible for all of us to see that the data we encounter online is just stuff on which to click and paste and copy and forward that actually represents human emotion and endeavor and impact  and to be able to have an ethical moment where we decide how we want to treat it. I even think it can go into the real world. We can end up  as we get in a world with more censors    everywhere there is something filming you  maybe putting it online    to be able to have a little clip you could wear that says   You know  I'd rather not.  And then have technology that the person taking the photo will know later  this person requested to be contacted before this goes anywhere big  if you don't mind. And that person taking the photo can make a decision about how and whether to respect it. In the real world  we see filtering of this sort taking place in Pakistan. And we now have means that we can build  like this system  so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it. And it's no longer just a  I don't know. I couldn't get there. I guess I'll move on   but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online. In fact  talk about technology imitating life imitating tech  or maybe it's the other way around. An NYU researcher here took little cardboard robots with smiley faces on them  and a motor that just drove them forward and a flag sticking out the back with a desired destination. It said   Can you help me get there   Released it on the streets of Manhattan. They'll fund anything these days. Here is the chart of over    people helping to steer the robot that could not steer and get it on its way  from one corner from one corner of Washington Square Park to another. That leads to example number three  hitchhiking. I'm not so sure hitchhiking is dead. Why  There is the Craigslist rideshare board. If it were called the Craigslist hitchhiking board  tumbleweeds would be blowing through it. But it's the rideshare board  and it's basically the same thing. Now why are people using it  I don't know. Maybe they think that  uh  killers don't plan ahead  No. I think the actual answer is that once you reframe it  once you get out of one set of stale expectations from a failed project that had its day  but now  for whatever reason  is tarnished  you can actually rekindle the kind of human kindness and sharing that something like this on Craigslist represents. And then you can highlight it into something like  yes  CouchSurfing.org. CouchSurfing  one guy's idea to  at last  put together people who are going somewhere far away and would like to sleep on a stranger's couch for free  with people who live far away  and would like someone they don't know to sleep on their couch for free. It's a brilliant idea. It's a bee that  yes  flies. Amazing how many successful couch surfings there have been. And if you're wondering  no  there have been no known fatalities associated with CouchSurfing. Although  to be sure  the reputation system  at the moment  works that you leave your report after the couch surfing experience  so there may be some selection bias there. So  my urging  my thought  is that the Internet isn't just a pile of information. It's not a noun. It's a verb. And when you go on it  if you listen and see carefully and closely enough  what you will discover is that that information is saying something to you. What it's saying to you is what we heard yesterday  Demosthenes was saying to us. It's saying   Let's march.  Thank you very much. Good morning. I think  as a grumpy Eastern European  I was brought in to play the pessimist this morning. So bear with me. Well  I come from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus  which  as some of you may know  is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy. So that's why I've always been fascinated with how technology could actually reshape and open up authoritarian societies like ours. So  I'm graduating college and  feeling very idealistic  I decided to join the NGO which actually was using new media to promote democracy and media reform in much of the former Soviet Union. However  to my surprise  I discovered that dictatorships do not crumble so easily. In fact  some of them actually survived the Internet challenge  and some got even more repressive. So this is when I ran out of my idealism and decided to quit my NGO job and actually study how the Internet could impede democratization. Now  I must tell you that this was never a very popular argument  and it's probably not very popular yet with some of you sitting in this audience. It was never popular with many political leaders  especially those in the United States who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn't. That is  promote democracy in difficult places where everything else has already been tried and failed. And I think by       this news has finally reached Britain  so I should probably add Gordon Brown to this list as well. However  there is an underlying argument about logistics  which has driven so much of this debate. Right  So if you look at it close enough  you'll actually see that much of this is about economics. The cybertopians say  much like fax machines and Xerox machines did in the '  s  blogs and social networks have radically transformed the economics of protest  so people would inevitably rebel. To put it very simply  the assumption so far has been that if you give people enough connectivity  if you give them enough devices  democracy will inevitably follow. And to tell you the truth  I never really bought into this argument  in part because I never saw three American presidents agree on anything else in the past. But  you know  even beyond that  if you think about the logic underlying it  is something I call iPod liberalism  where we assume that every single Iranian or Chinese who happens to have and love his iPod will also love liberal democracy. And again  I think this is kind of false. But I think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic    that we should be dropping iPods not bombs    I mean  it would make a fascinating title for Thomas Friedman's new book. But this is rarely a good sign. Right  So  the bigger problem with this logic is that it confuses the intended versus the actual uses of technology. For those of you who think that new media of the Internet could somehow help us avert genocide  should look no further than Rwanda  where in the '  s it was actually two radio stations which were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the first place. But even beyond that  coming back to the Internet  what you can actually see is that certain governments have mastered the use of cyberspace for propaganda purposes. Right  And they are building what I call the Spinternet. The combination of spin  on the one hand  and the Internet on the other. So governments from Russia to China to Iran are actually hiring  training and paying bloggers in order to leave ideological comments and create a lot of ideological blog posts to comment on sensitive political issues. Right  So you may wonder  why on Earth are they doing it  Why are they engaging with cyberspace  Well my theory is that it's happening because censorship actually is less effective than you think it is in many of those places. The moment you put something critical in a blog  even if you manage to ban it immediately  it will still spread around thousands and thousands of other blogs. So the more you block it  the more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship and thus win in this cat and mouse game. So the only way to control this message is actually to try to spin it and accuse anyone who has written something critical of being  for example  a CIA agent. And  again  this is happening quite often. Just to give you an example of how it works in China  for example. There was a big case in February      called  Elude the Cat.  And for those of you who didn't know  I'll just give a little summary. So what happened is that a    year old man  a Chinese man  died in prison custody. And police said that it happened because he was playing hide and seek  which is  elude the cat  in Chinese slang  with other inmates and hit his head against the wall  which was not an explanation which sat well with many Chinese bloggers. So they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments. In fact  QQ.com  which is a popular Chinese website  had        comments on this issue within hours. But then authorities did something very smart. Instead of trying to purge these comments  they instead went and reached out to the bloggers. And they basically said   Look guys. We'd like you to become netizen investigators.  So     people applied  and four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question  and thus inspect it and then blog about it. Within days the entire incident was forgotten  which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content. People would keep talking about it for weeks. And this actually fits with another interesting theory about what's happening in authoritarian states and in their cyberspace. This is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation  and it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics and letting them engage with each other online. We tend to think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships  but in many cases it only strengthens them. And you may wonder why. I'll just give you a very short list of reasons why authoritarian deliberation may actually help the dictators. And first it's quite simple. Most of them operate in a complete information vacuum. They don't really have the data they need in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime. So encouraging people to actually go online and share information and data on blogs and wikis is great because otherwise  low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats will continue concealing what's actually happening in the country  right  So from this perspective  having blogs and wikis produce knowledge has been great. Secondly  involving public in any decision making is also great because it helps you to share the blame for the policies which eventually fail. Because they say   Well look  we asked you  we consulted you  you voted on it. You put it on the front page of your blog. Well  great. You are the one who is to blame.  And finally  the purpose of any authoritarian deliberation efforts is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes  both at home and abroad. So inviting people to all sorts of public forums  having them participate in decision making  it's actually great. Because what happens is that then you can actually point to this initiative and say   Well  we are having a democracy. We are having a forum.  Just to give you an example  one of the Russian regions  for example  now involves its citizens in planning its strategy up until year     . Right  So they can go online and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year     . I mean  anyone who has been to Russia would know that there was no planning in Russia for the next month. So having people involved in planning for      is not necessarily going to change anything  because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda. Just to give you an example from Iran  we all heard about the Twitter revolution that happened there  but if you look close enough  you'll actually see that many of the networks and blogs and Twitter and Facebook were actually operational. They may have become slower  but the activists could still access it and actually argue that having access to them is actually great for many authoritarian states. And it's great simply because they can gather open source intelligence. In the past it would take you weeks  if not months  to identify how Iranian activists connect to each other. Now you actually know how they connect to each other by looking at their Facebook page. I mean KGB  and not just KGB  used to torture in order to actually get this data. Now it's all available online. But I think the biggest conceptual pitfall that cybertopians made is when it comes to digital natives  people who have grown up online. We often hear about cyber activism  how people are getting more active because of the Internet. Rarely hear about cyber hedonism  for example  how people are becoming passive. Why  Because they somehow assume that the Internet is going to be the catalyst of change that will push young people into the streets  while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography. That's not an option being considered too strongly. So for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of Tehran  there may as well be two digital captives who are actually rebelling only in the World of Warcraft. And this is realistic. And there is nothing wrong about it because the Internet has greatly empowered many of these young people and it plays a completely different social role for them. If you look at some of the surveys on how the young people actually benefit from the Internet  you'll see that the number of teenagers in China  for example  for whom the Internet actually broadens their sex life  is three times more than in the United States. So it does play a social role  however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement. So the way I tend to think of it is like a hierarchy of cyber needs in space  a total rip off from Abraham Maslow. But the point here is that when we get the remote Russian village online  what will get people to the Internet is not going to be the reports from Human Rights Watch. It's going to be pornography   Sex and the City   or maybe watching funny videos of cats. So this is something you have to recognize. So what should we do about it  Well I say we have to stop thinking about the number of iPods per capita and start thinking about ways in which we can empower intellectuals  dissidents  NGOs and then the members of civil society. Because even what has been happening up 'til now with the Spinternet and authoritarian deliberation  there is a great chance that those voices will not be heard. So I think we should shatter some of our utopian assumptions and actually start doing something about it. Thank you. Thank you. Two years ago  I stood on the TED stage in Arusha  Tanzania. I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations. It was a simple machine that changed my life. Before that time  I had never been away from my home in Malawi. I had never used a computer. I had never seen an Internet. On the stage that day  I was so nervous. My English lost  I wanted to vomit. I had never been surrounded by so many azungu  white people. There was a story I wouldn't tell you then. But well  I'm feeling good right now. I would like to share that story today. We have seven children in my family. All sisters  excepting me. This is me with my dad when I was a little boy. Before I discovered the wonders of science  I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers. Like everyone else  we grew maize. One year our fortune turned very bad. In      we experienced an awful famine. Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death. My family ate one meal per day  at night. Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us. The food passes through our bodies. We drop down to nothing. In Malawi  the secondary school  you have to pay school fees. Because of the hunger  I was forced to drop out of school. I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields. It was the future I couldn't accept. I felt very happy to be at the secondary school  so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education. So I went to a library. I read books  science books  especially physics. I couldn't read English that well. I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them. Another book put that knowledge in my hands. It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity. Pump water meant irrigation  a defense against hunger  which we were experiencing by that time. So I decided I would build one windmill for myself. But I didn't have materials to use  so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials. Many people  including my mother  said I was crazy. I found a tractor fan  shock absorber  PVC pipes. Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo  I built my machine. It was one light at first. And then four lights  with switches  and even a circuit breaker  modeled after an electric bell. Another machine pumps water for irrigation. Queues of people start lining up at my house to charge their mobile phone. I could not get rid of them. And the reporters came too  which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED. I had never seen an airplane before. I had never slept in a hotel. So  on stage that day in Arusha  my English lost  I said something like   I tried. And I made it.  So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans  and the poor who are struggling with your dreams. God bless. Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet. I say to you  trust yourself and believe. Whatever happens  don't give up. Thank you. Okay  so    percent of my photographic process is  in fact  not photographic. It involves a campaign of letter writing  research and phone calls to access my subjects  which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in West Virginia. And oddly  the most notable letter of rejection I ever received came from Walt Disney World  a seemingly innocuous site. And it read    I'm just going to read a key sentence   Especially during these violent times  I personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to.  Photography threatens fantasy. They didn't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities  myths and beliefs  and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth. But there are multiple truths attached to every image  depending on the creator's intention  the viewer and the context in which it is presented. Over a five year period following September   th  when the American media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders  most notably weapons of mass destruction  I chose to look inward at that which was integral to America's foundation  mythology and daily functioning. I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen  self imposed and real  and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge. It was a critical moment in American history and global history where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information. And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes  but what I came away with is a photograph. And it's just another place from which to observe  and the understanding that there are no absolute  all knowing insiders. And the outsider can never really reach the core. I'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series. It's titled   An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar   and it's comprised of nearly    images. In this context I'll just show you a few. This is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility at Hanford site in Washington State  where there are over       stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water. A human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly. And I found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the United States of America  which you can see here. And a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text. So I create these two poles. Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text. And what I'm most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image  and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image. So  at best  the image is meant to float away into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy. And then the text functions as this cruel anchor that kind of nails it to the ground. But in this context I'm just going to read an abridged version of those texts. This is a cryopreservation unit  and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger  who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health  with advancements in science and technology  all for the cost of    thousand dollars  for forever. This is a    year old Palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty. Hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state  allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations regarding virginity and marriage. So it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen  allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse  to simulate the loss of virginity. This is a jury simulation deliberation room  and you can see beyond that two way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror. And they observe deliberations after mock trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that they're hoping for. This process costs        dollars. This is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room  a contraband room  at John F. Kennedy International Airport. On that table you can see    hours' worth of seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States. There is a pig's head and African cane rats. And part of my photographic work is I'm not just documenting what's there. I do take certain liberties and intervene. And in this I really wanted it to resemble an early still life painting  so I spent some time with the smells and items. This is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA in Langley  Virginia  their original headquarters building. And the CIA has had a long history with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts. And it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter Soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro American thoughts and aesthetics. And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency  and had thus come under question  is abstract expressionism. This is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility  and on a six acre plot there are approximately    cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers who are interested in monitoring a rate of corpse decomposition. And in this particular photograph the body of a young boy has been used to reenact a crime scene. This is the only federally funded site where it is legal to cultivate cannabis for scientific research in the United States. It's a research crop marijuana grow room. And part of the work that I hope for is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy where you can't find any discernible formula in how these things    they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science to religion to security    and you can't completely understand how information is being distributed. These are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean  connecting North America to Europe. They carry over    million simultaneous voice conversations  and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability. This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut. But stuff did feel like it could have been taken    or    years ago  like it was locked in the Cold War era and hadn't necessarily progressed. This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine. And this is ... a division of the Library of Congress produces a free national library service for the blind and visually impaired  and the publications they choose to publish are based on reader popularity. And Playboy is always in the top few. But you'd be surprised  they don't do the photographs. It's just the text. This is an avian quarantine facility where all imported birds coming into America are required to undergo a    day quarantine  where they are tested for diseases including Exotic Newcastle Disease and Avian Influenza. This film shows the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead. And the Air Armament Center at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida is responsible for the deployment and testing of all air delivered weaponry coming from the United States. And the film was shot on    millimeter  government issue film. And that red dot is a marking on the government issue film. All living white tigers in North America are the result of selective inbreeding    that would be mother to son  father to daughter  sister to brother    to allow for the genetic conditions that create a salable white tiger. Meaning white fur  ice blue eyes  a pink nose. And the majority of these white tigers are not born in a salable state and are killed at birth. It's a very violent process that is little known. And the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment. Kenny was born. He actually made it to adulthood. He has since passed away  but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities. This  on a lighter note  is at George Lucas' personal archive. This is the Death Star. And it's shown here in its true orientation. In the context of  Star Wars  Return of the Jedi   its mirror image is presented. They flip the negative. And you can see the photoetched brass detailing  and the painted acrylic facade. In the context of the film  this is a deep space battle station of the Galactic Empire  capable of annihilating planets and civilizations  and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet. This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky. It's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site. Essentially they've simulated a city for urban combat  and this is one of the structures that exists in that city. It's called the World Church of God. It's supposed to be a generic site of worship. And after I took this photograph  they constructed a wall around the World Church of God to mimic the set up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq. And I worked with Mehta Vihar who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice. And we put that wall around the World Church of God  and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for the army. And I put them into my photograph. This is live HIV virus at Harvard Medical School  who is working with the U.S. Government to develop sterilizing immunity. And Alhurra is a U.S. Government  sponsored Arabic language television network that distributes news and information to over    countries in the Arab world. It runs    hours a day  commercial free. However  it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States. And in       they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq  which specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq and is broadcast to Iraq. Now I'm going to move on to another project I did. It's titled  The Innocents.  And for the men in these photographs  photography had been used to create a fantasy. Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth  in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie. I traveled across the United States photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit  violent crimes. I investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction  and its influence on memory  which can lead to severe  even lethal consequences. For the men in these photographs  the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification. A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of images. But through exposure to composite sketches  Polaroids  mug shots and line ups  eyewitness testimony can change. I'll give you an example from a case. A woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker. She saw some similarities in one of the photographs  but couldn't quite make a positive identification. Days later  she is presented with another photo array of all new photographs  except that one photograph that she had some draw to from the earlier array is repeated in the second array. And a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory  if there ever was an actual memory. Photography offered the criminal justice system a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals  and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations of relying on photographic identifications. Frederick Daye  who is photographed at his alibi location  where    witnesses placed him at the time of the crime. He was convicted by an all white jury of rape  kidnapping and vehicle theft. And he served    years of a life sentence. Now DNA exonerated Frederick and it also implicated another man who was serving time in prison. But the victim refused to press charges because she claimed that law enforcement had permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph. Charles Fain was convicted of kidnapping  rape and murder of a young girl walking to school. He served    years of a death sentence. I photographed him at the scene of the crime at the Snake River in Idaho. And I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted at sites that came to particular significance in the history of their wrongful conviction. The scene of arrest  the scene of misidentification  the alibi location. And here  the scene of the crime  it's this place to which he's never been  but changed his life forever. So photographing there  I was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction  in both his life and in photography. Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder. He served    years of a life sentence in Waco  Texas. Larry Mayes  I photographed at the scene of arrest  where he hid between two mattresses in Gary  Indiana  in this very room to hide from the police. He ended up serving    and a half years of an    year sentence for rape and robbery. The victim failed to identify Larry in two live lineups and then made a positive identification  days later  from a photo array. Larry Youngblood served eight years of a    and half year sentence in Arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing of a    year old boy at a carnival. He is photographed at his alibi location. Ron Williamson. Ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club  and served    years of a death sentence. I photographed Ron at a baseball field because he had been drafted to the Oakland A's to play professional baseball just before his conviction. And the state's key witness in Ron's case was  in the end  the actual perpetrator. Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a    year old woman. I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago. William Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary. He served seven years of a    year sentence in Kentucky. Timothy Durham  who I photographed at his alibi location where    witnesses placed him at the time of the crime  was convicted of  .  years of a      year sentence  for several charges of rape and robbery. He had been misidentified by an    year old victim. Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia. He was convicted of rape  kidnapping and robbery  and served seven years of a    year sentence. Troy's picture was in a photo array that the victim tentatively had some draw toward  but said he looked too old. The police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb from four years earlier  which they entered into a photo array days later  and he was positively identified. Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait. And it reiterates that distortion is a constant  and our eyes are easily deceived. That's it. Thank you. Clearly  we're living in a moment of crisis. Arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us  and yet I stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive. Because of some of technologies we've been talking about. Because of the resources  the skills  and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world  with the mindset to create change. And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen  who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower  but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world. And by definition  every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul  a global citizen. You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another. And no matter what country you live or work in  you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of  even in their most ordinariness. Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty  how best we release their energies. On the one hand  we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out. And on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid. And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems. We call it patient capital. The critics point to the     billion dollars spent in Africa since      and say  and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty  rampant corruption  They use Mobutu as metaphor. And their policy prescription is to make government more accountable  focus on the capital markets  invest  don't give anything away. On the other side  as I said  there are those who say the problem is that we need more money. That when it comes to the rich  we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid  but when it comes to our poor brethren  we want little to do with it. They point to the successes of aid  the eradication of smallpox  and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals. Both sides are right. And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other. Even more problematic  they're not listening to poor people themselves. After    years of working on issues of poverty and innovation  it's true that there are probably no more market oriented individuals on the planet than low income people. They must navigate markets daily  making micro decisions  dozens and dozens  to move their way through society  and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family  they could be put back into poverty  sometimes for generations. And so we need both the market and we need aid. Patient capital works between  and tries to take the best of both. It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare  water  housing  alternative energy  thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity  but as individual customers  consumers  clients  people who want to make decisions in their own lives. Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk  a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment  to use the market as the best listening device that we have  and the expectation of below market returns  but outsized social impact. It recognizes that the market has its limitation  and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people. Now  entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons. First  they tend to work in markets where people make one  two  three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level. Second  the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure    no roads to speak of  sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption. Third  they are often creating markets. Even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages  it is something new. And so many low income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time  takes a lot of patience. It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance. Not only to build the systems  the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way  but to connect those business to other markets  to governments  to corporations    real partnerships if we want to get to scale. I want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation. In      I met this incredible entrepreneur named Amitabha Sadangi from India  who'd been working for    years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet. And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low income farmers altogether  despite the fact that     million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day. They were creating subsidies either for large farms  or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use  rather than that the farmers wanted to use. At the same time Amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in Israel. It was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant. And it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green. But the market also had bypassed low income farmers  because these systems were both too expensive  and they were constructed for fields that were too large. The average small village farmer works on two acres or less. And so  Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves  because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have. And he used three fundamental principles. The first one was miniaturization. The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre  even if he had two  because it was too frightening  given all that he had at stake. Second  it had to be extremely affordable. In other words  that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest  or else they wouldn't take the risk. And third  it had to be what Amitabha calls infinitely expandable. What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre  the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth. As of today  IDE India  Amitabha's organization  has sold over         farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average  but this didn't happen overnight. In fact  when you go back to the beginning  there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day  that were known to be some of the most risk averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors  agriculture. And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants to research  to experiment  to fail  to innovate and try again. And when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers  that's when patient capital could come in. And we helped him build a company  for profit  that would build on IDE's knowledge  and start looking at sales and exports  and be able to tap into other kinds of capital. Secondarily  we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries. And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan. And while  again  you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in India into Pakistan  just to get the permits  over time we were able to start a company with Dr. Sono  who runs a large community development organization in the Thar Desert  which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country. And though that company has just started  our assumption is that there too we'll see the impact on millions. But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation. We're starting to see these happening all around the world. In Arusha  Tanzania  A to Z Textile Manufacturing has worked in partnership with us  with UNICEF  with the Global Fund  to create a factory that now employs       people  mostly women. And they produce    million lifesaving bednets for Africans around the world. Lifespring Hospital is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India to bring quality  affordable maternal health care to low income women  and it's been so successful that it's currently building a new hospital every    days. And      Ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry  building an ambulance service in Bombay that would use the technology of Google Earth  a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access  and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption. So that in the terrorist attacks of November they were the first responder  and are now beginning to scale  because of partnership. They've just won four government contracts to build off their     ambulances  and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in India. This idea of scale is critical. Because we're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed have reached at least a quarter million people. But that's obviously not enough. And it's where the idea of partnership becomes so important. Whether it's by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets  government itself  or partner with major corporations  there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation. President Obama understands that. He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund to focus on what works in this country  and look at how we can scale it. And I would submit that it's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations  not only for their country  but ones that we can use in the developed world as well. Invest financial assistance  but also management assistance. And then measure the returns  both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective. When we think about new approaches to aid  it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan. We've had a rocky relationship with that country and  in all fairness  the United States has not always been a very reliable partner. But again I would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen. And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund  we could use this time to invest not directly in government  though we would have government's blessing  nor in international experts  but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country. People like Rashani Zafar  who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country  and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country. And Tasneem Siddiqui  who developed a way called incremental housing  where he has moved        slum dwellers into safe  affordable community housing. Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation that are building schools across the country. It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban. I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now  and those of you who've also worked there can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population  and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature. President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. I would say that the converse is true. That these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the    percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day  provide real pathways to hope. And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan  while we need to strengthen the judiciary  build greater stability  we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world. On one of my last visits to Pakistan  I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert. And we left Karachi one morning before dawn. It was about     degrees. And we drove for eight hours along this moonscape like landscape with very little color  lots of heat  very little discussion  because we were exhausted. And finally  at the end of the journey  I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon. And as we got closer  its significance became apparent. That there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall. Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life. His name was Raja  and he had kind  twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father. And he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn't taken his    children and    grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about    cents a day. Because he was building these crops. And with the money he earned he could stay this year. And for the first time ever in three generations  his children would go to school. We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons. And he said   Of course I will. Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore.  When we think about solutions to poverty  we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity. Because at the end of the day  dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth. And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity. Because that is where dignity really starts. Martin Luther King said that love without power is anemic and sentimental  and that power without love is reckless and abusive. Our generation has seen both approaches tried  and often fail. But I think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power. For that is what we'll need  as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us  and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet. The time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions  a cross sector  is now. I can only talk from my own experience  but in eight years of running Acumen fund  I've seen the power of patient capital. Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking  but to truly build systems that have created more than        jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet. I know it works. But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work. And so I urge you  in whatever sector you work  in whatever job you do  to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those we're trying to help. Rather than what we think that they might need. It will take embracing the world with both arms. And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability  with a sense of integrity and perseverance. And yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations. And there is so much good that we can do. Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert. Thank you. Do we live in a borderless world  Before you answer that  have a look at this map. Contemporary political map shows that we have over     countries in the world today. That's probably more than at any time in centuries. Now  many of you will object. For you this would be a more appropriate map. You could call it TEDistan. In TEDistan  there are no borders  just connected spaces and unconnected spaces. Most of you probably reside in one of the    dots on this screen  of the many more that represent    percent of the world economy. But let's talk about the    percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born. For them  nations  countries  boundaries  borders still matter a great deal  and often violently. Now here at TED  we're solving some of the great riddles of science and mysteries of the universe. Well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved  our basic political geography. How do we distribute ourselves around the world  Now this is important  because border conflicts justify so much of the world's military industrial complex. Border conflicts can derail so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here. So I think we need a deeper understanding of how people  money  power  religion  culture  technology interact to change the map of the world. And we can try to anticipate those changes  and shape them in a more constructive direction. So we're going to look at some maps of the past  the present and some maps you haven't seen in order to get a sense of where things are going. Let's start with the world of     .      there were just     countries in the world. After World War II  Europe was devastated  but still held large overseas colonies  French West Africa  British East Africa  South Asia  and so forth. Then over the late '  s  '  s  '  s  '  s and '  s  waves of decolonization took place. Over    new countries were born. You can see that Africa has been fragmented. India  Pakistan  Bangladesh  South East Asian nations created. Then came the end of the Cold War. The end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. You had the creation of new states in Eastern Europe  the former Yugoslav republics and the Balkans  and the 'stans of central Asia. Today we have     countries in the world. The entire planet is covered by sovereign  independent nation states. Does that mean that someone's gain has to be someone else's loss  Let's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world  Eastern Eurasia. As you can see on this map  Russia is still the largest country in the world. And as you know  China is the most populous. And they share a lengthy land border. What you don't see on this map is that most of Russia's     million people are concentrated in its western provinces and areas that are close to Europe. And only    million people are in its eastern areas. In fact  the World Bank predicts that Russia's population is declining towards about     million people And there is another thing that you don't see on this map. Stalin  Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders forced Russians out to the far east to be in gulags  labor camps  nuclear cities  whatever the case was. But as oil prices rose  Russian governments have invested in infrastructure to unite the country  east and west. But nothing has more perversely impacted Russia's demographic distribution  because the people in the east  who never wanted to be there anyway  have gotten on those trains and roads and gone back to the west. As a result  in the Russian far east today  which is twice the size of India  you have exactly six million Russians. So let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world. We can start with Mongolia  or as some call it  Mine golia. Why do they call it that  Because in Mine golia  Chinese firms operate and own most of the mines    copper  zinc  gold    and they truck the resources south and east into mainland China. China isn't conquering Mongolia. It's buying it. Colonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought. So let's apply this principle to Siberia. Siberia most of you probably think of as a cold  desolate  unlivable place. But in fact  with global warming and rising temperatures  all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields and agribusiness  and grain being produced in Siberia. But who is it going to feed  Well  just on the other side of the Amo River  in the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China  you have over     million people. That's larger than the entire population of Russia. Every single year  for at least a decade or more           of them have been voting with their feet  crossing  moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain. They set up their own bazaars and medical clinics. They've taken over the timber industry and been shipping the lumber east  back into China. Again  like Mongolia  China isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it. That's what I call globalization Chinese style. Now maybe this is what the map of the region might look like in    to    years. But hold on. This map is     years old. This is the map of the Yuan Dynasty  led by Kublai Khan  the grandson of Genghis Khan. So history doesn't necessarily repeat itself  but it does rhyme. This is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world. Again  globalization Chinese style. Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography. So  the history of East Asia in fact  people don't think about nations and borders. They think more in terms of empires and hierarchies  usually Chinese or Japanese. Well it's China's turn again. So let's look at how China is re establishing that hierarchy in the far East. It starts with the global hubs. Remember the    dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global economy  East Asia today has more of those global hubs than any other region in the world. Tokyo  Seoul  Beijing  Shanghai  Hong Kong  Singapore and Sidney. These are the filters and funnels of global capital. Trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region  so much of it being invested into China. Then there is trade. These vectors and arrows represent ever stronger trade relationships that China has with every country in the region. Specifically  it targets Japan and Korea and Australia  countries that are strong allies of the United States. Australia  for example  is heavily dependent on exporting iron ore and natural gas to China. For poorer countries  China reduces tariffs so that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply and become dependent on exporting to China as well. And now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to China to lead the rebound  the economic rebound  not just in Asia  but potentially for the world. The Asian free trade zone  almost free trade zone  that's emerging now has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific. So China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region. Another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy. China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region. It has become the hub of diplomatic institutions such as the East Asian Community. Some of these organizations don't even have the United States as a member. There is a treaty of nonaggression between countries  such that if there were a conflict between China and the United States  most countries vow to just sit it out  including American allies like Korea and Australia. Another pillar of the strategy  like Russia  is demographic. China exports business people  nannies  students  teachers to teach Chinese around the region  to intermarry and to occupy ever greater commanding heights of the economies. Already ethnic Chinese people in Malaysia  Thailand and Indonesia are the real key factors and drivers in the economies there. Chinese pride is resurgent in the region as a result. Singapore  for example  used to ban Chinese language education. Now it encourages it. If you add it all up what do you get  Well  if you remember before World War II  Japan had a vision for a greater Japanese co prosperity sphere. What's emerging today is what you might call a greater Chinese co prosperity sphere. So no matter what the lines on the map tell you in terms of nations and borders  what you really have emerging in the far east are national cultures  but in a much more fluid  imperial zone. All of this is happening without firing a shot. That's most certainly not the case in the Middle East where countries are still very uncomfortable in the borders left behind by European colonialists. So what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world  What lines on the map should we focus on  What I want to present to you is what I call state building  day by day. Let's start with Iraq. Six years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq  the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality. Oil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together  now it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration. The reason is Kurdistan. The Kurds for       years have been waging a struggle for independence  and now is their chance to finally have it. These are pipeline routes  which emerge from Kurdistan  which is an oil rich region. And today  if you go to Kurdistan  you'll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas are squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army. But what are they guarding  Is it really a border on the map  No. It's the pipelines. If the Kurds can control their pipelines  they can set the terms of their own statehood. Now should we be upset about this  about the potential disintegration of Iraq  I don't believe we should. Iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world  behind Saudi Arabia. And we'll have a chance to solve a       year old dispute. Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked. It has no choice but to behave. In order to profit from its oil it has to export it through Turkey or Syria  and other countries  and Iraq itself. And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them. Now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region. That is  of course  in Palestine. Palestine is something of a cartographic anomaly because it's two parts Palestinian  one part Israel.    years of rose garden diplomacy have not delivered us peace in this conflict. What might  I believe that what might solve the problem is infrastructure. Today donors are spending billions of dollars on this. These two arrows are an arc  an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure that link the West Bank and Gaza. If Gaza can have a functioning port and be linked to the West Bank  you can have a viable Palestinian state  Palestinian economy. That  I believe  is going to bring peace to this particular conflict. The lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine is that independence alone  without infrastructure  is futile. Now what might this entire region look like if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders  when the insecurities might abate  The last time that was the case was actually a century ago  during the Ottoman Empire. This is the Hejaz Railway. The Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus. It even had an offshoot running to Haifa in what is today Israel  on the Mediterranean Sea. But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters  ruins. If we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map  infrastructure  that cross the straight lines  the borders  I believe the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region. Now let's look at another part of the world  the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia  the 'stans. These countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees. He purposely did not want these countries to make sense. He wanted ethnicities to mingle in ways that would allow him to divide and rule. Fortunately for them  most of their oil and gas resources were discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed. Now I know some of you may be thinking   Oil  oil  oil. Why is it all he's talking about is oil   Well  there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil and the way we're talking about it now. Before it was  how do we control their oil  Now it's their oil for their own purposes. And I assure you it's every bit as important to them as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists. Here are just some of the pipeline projections and possibilities and scenarios and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades. A great deal of them. For a number of countries in this part of the world  having pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy and for having some meaning besides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves. Just take Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the Caucuses  but now with the Baku Tbilisi Ceyhan pipeline into Turkey  it has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west. Then there is Turkmenistan  which most people think of as a frozen basket case. But now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea to provide for Europe  and even a potentially Turkmen  Afghan Pakistan India pipeline as well. Then there is Kazakhstan  which didn't even have a name before. It was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union. Today most people recognize Kazakhstan as an emerging geopolitical player. Why  Because it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian  north through Russia  and even east to China. More pipelines means more silk roads  instead of the Great Game. The Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other. Silk road connotes independence and mutual trust. The more pipelines we have  the more silk roads we'll have  and the less of a dominant Great Game competition we'll have in the   st century. Now let's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders  and how that has enhanced its strength. And that is  of course  Europe. The European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries  and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany to happen in a peaceful way. But then eventually it grew into    countries  and those are the    stars on the European flag. The E.U. also became a currency block  and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world. On average  the E.U. has grown by one country per year since the end of the Cold War. In fact most of that happened on just one day. In          new countries joined the E.U. and now you have what most people consider a zone of peace spanning    countries and     million people. So what is next  What is the future of the European Union  Well in light blue  you see the zones or the regions that are at least two thirds or more dependent on the European Union for trade and investment. What does that tell us  Trade and investment tell us that Europe is putting its money where its mouth is. Even if these regions aren't part of the E.U.  they are becoming part of its sphere of influence. Just take the Balkans. Croatia  Serbia Bosnia  they're not members of the E.U. yet. But you can get on a German ICE train and make it almost to Albania. In Bosnia you use the Euro currency already  and that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have. So  looking at other parts of Europe's periphery  such as North Africa. On average  every year or two  a new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the Mediterranean  connecting North Africa to Europe. That not only helps Europe diminish its reliance on Russia for energy  but if you travel to North Africa today  you'll hear more and more people saying that they don't really think of their region as the Middle East. So in other words  I believe that President Sarkozy of France is right when he talks about a Mediterranean union. Now let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus. I mentioned Azerbaijan before. That corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus has become the conduit for    percent of Europe's energy supply. So does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union  I don't think it does. I think it's already part of a Euro Turkish superpower. So what's next  Where are we going to see borders change and new countries born  Well  South Central Asia  South West Asia is a very good place to start. Eight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan there is still a tremendous amount of instability. Pakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile that neither of them have dealt constructively with the problem of Pashtun nationalism. This is the flag that flies in the minds of    million Pashtuns who live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border. Let's not neglect the insurgency just to the south  Balochistan. Two weeks ago  Balochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison  and this was the flag that they raised over it. The post colonial entropy that is happening around the world is accelerating  and I expect more such changes to occur in the map as the states fragment. Of course  we can't forget Africa.    countries  and by far the most number of suspiciously straight lines on the map. If we were to look at all of Africa we could most certainly acknowledge far more  tribal divisions and so forth. But let's just look at Sudan  the second largest country in Africa. It has three ongoing civil wars  the genocide in Darfur  which you all know about  the civil war in the east of the country  and south Sudan. South Sudan is going to be having a referendum in      in which it is very likely to vote itself independence. Now let's go up to the Arctic Circle. There is a great race on for energy resources under the Arctic seabed. Who will win  Canada  Russia  The United States  Actually Greenland. Several weeks ago Greenland's          people voted themselves self governance rights from Denmark. So Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller. What is the lesson from all of this  Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline. It's constantly morphing and changing the world  like climate change. And like our relationship with the ecosystem we're always searching for equilibrium in how we divide ourselves across the planet. Now we fear changes on the map. We fear civil wars  death tolls  having to learn the names of new countries. But I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today is far worse and far more violent. The question is how do we change those borders  and what lines do we focus on  I believe we focus on the lines that cross borders  the infrastructure lines. Then we'll wind up with the world we want  a borderless one. Thank you. I'd like to talk a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design to design thinking. Now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project I was ever hired to do  something like    years ago. It's a woodworking machine  or at least a piece of one  and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern  a little bit easier to use. I thought  at the time  I did a pretty good job. Unfortunately  not very long afterwards the company went out of business. This is the second project that I did. It's a fax machine. I put an attractive shell around some new technology. Again     months later  the product was obsolete. And now  of course  the whole technology is obsolete. Now  I'm a fairly slow learner  but eventually it occurred to me that maybe what passed for design wasn't all that important    making things more attractive  making them a bit easier to use  making them more marketable. By focusing on a design  maybe just a single product  I was being incremental and not having much of an impact. But I think this small view of design is a relatively recent phenomenon  and in fact really emerged in the latter half of the   th century as design became a tool of consumerism. So when we talk about design today  and particularly when we read about it in the popular press  we're often talking about products like these. Amusing  Yes. Desirable  Maybe. Important  Not so very. But this wasn't always the way. And I'd like to suggest that if we take a different view of design  and focus less on the object and more on design thinking as an approach  that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact. Now this gentleman  Isambard Kingdom Brunel  designed many great things in his career in the   th century  including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol and the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe. Both great designs and actually very innovative too. His greatest creation runs actually right through here in Oxford. It's called the Great Western Railway. And as a kid I grew up very close to here  and one of my favorite things to do was to cycle along by the side of the railway waiting for the great big express trains to roar past. You can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting   Rain  Steam and Speed . Now  what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers was the experience of floating across the countryside. Now  this was back in the   th century. And to do that meant creating the flattest gradients that had ever yet been made  which meant building long viaducts across river valleys    this is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead    and long tunnels such as the one at Box  in Wiltshire. But he didn't stop there. He didn't stop with just trying to design the best railway journey. He imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in London and disembark from a ship in New York. One journey from London to New York. This is the S.S. Great Western that he built to take care of the second half of that journey. Now  Brunel was working     years before the emergence of the design profession  but I think he was using design thinking to solve problems and to create world changing innovations. Now  design thinking begins with what Roger Martin  the business school professor at the University of Toronto  calls integrative thinking. And that's the ability to exploit opposing ideas and opposing constraints to create new solutions. In the case of design  that means balancing desirability  what humans need  with technical feasibility  and economic viability. With innovations like the Great Western  we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit. So somehow  we went from this to this. Systems thinkers who were reinventing the world  to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses working on small things. As our industrial society matured  so design became a profession and it focused on an ever smaller canvas until it came to stand for aesthetics  image and fashion. Now I'm not trying to throw stones here. I'm a fully paid up member of that priesthood  and somewhere in here I have my designer glasses. There we go. But I do think that perhaps design is getting big again. And that's happening through the application of design thinking to new kinds of problems    to global warming  to education  healthcare  security  clean water  whatever. And as we see this reemergence of design thinking and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems  there are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful. And I'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes. The first of those is that design is human centered. It may integrate technology and economics  but it starts with what humans need  or might need. What makes life easier  more enjoyable  What makes technology useful and usable  But that is more than simply good ergonomics  putting the buttons in the right place. It's often about understanding culture and context before we even know where to start to have ideas. So when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India  they wanted to understand what the aspirations and motivations were of these school children to understand how they might play a role in screening their parents. Conversion Sound has developed a high quality  ultra low cost digital hearing aid for the developing world. Now  in the West we rely on highly trained technicians to fit these hearing aids. In places like India  those technicians simply don't exist. So it took a team working in India with patients and community health workers to understand how a PDA and an application on a PDA might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service. Instead of starting with technology  the team started with people and culture. So if human need is the place to start  then design thinking rapidly moves on to learning by making. Instead of thinking about what to build  building in order to think. Now  prototypes speed up the process of innovation  because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses. And the faster we do that  the faster our ideas evolve. Now  much has been said and written about the Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai  India. They do an incredible job of serving very poor patients by taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay to cross subsidize those who cannot. Now  they are very efficient  but they are also very innovative. When I visited them a few years ago  what really impressed me was their willingness to prototype their ideas very early. This is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs. They make their own intraocular lenses. These are the lenses that replace those that are damaged by cataracts. And I think it's partly their prototyping mentality that really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough. Because they brought the cost down from      a pair  down to just    a pair. Partly they did this by instead of building a fancy new factory  they used the basement of one of their hospitals. And instead of installing the large scale machines used by western producers  they used low cost CAD CAM prototyping technology. They are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world and have recently moved into a custom factory. So if human need is the place to start  and prototyping  a vehicle for progress  then there are also some questions to ask about the destination. Instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption  design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation    the shift from a passive relationship between consumer and producer to the active engagement of everyone in experiences that are meaningful  productive and profitable. So I'd like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about  this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things  and take that a little bit further and say that I think the design of participatory systems  in which many more forms of value beyond simply cash are both created and measured  is going to be the major theme  not only for design  but also for our economy as we go forward. So William Beveridge  when he wrote the first of his famous reports in       created what became Britain's welfare state in which he hoped that every citizen would be an active participant in their own social well being. By the time he wrote his third report  he confessed that he had failed and instead had created a society of welfare consumers. Hilary Cottam  Charlie Leadbeater  and Hugo Manassei of Participle have taken this idea of participation  and in their manifesto entitled Beveridge  .   they are suggesting a framework for reinventing the welfare state. So in one of their projects called Southwark Circle  they worked with residents in Southwark  South London and a small team of designers to develop a new membership organization to help the elderly with household tasks. Designs were refined and developed with     older people and their families before the service was launched earlier this year. We can take this idea of participation perhaps to its logical conclusion and say that design may have its greatest impact when it's taken out of the hands of designers and put into the hands of everyone. Nurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system Kaiser Permanente study the topic of improving the patient experience  and particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge and change shift. Through a program of observational research  brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping  they've developed a completely new way to change shift. They went from retreating to the nurse's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients  to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients  using a simple software tool. By doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients down from    minutes to    minutes  on average. They increased patient confidence and nurse happiness. When you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in    hospitals in the system  it resulted  actually  in a pretty big impact. And this is just one of thousands of opportunities in healthcare alone. So these are just some of the kind of basic ideas around design thinking and some of the new kinds of projects that they're being applied to. But I'd like to go back to Brunel here  and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now  and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool. And that connection is change. In times of change we need new alternatives  new ideas. Now  Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution  when all of life and our economy was being reinvented. Now the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course  and indeed they are part of the problem today. But  again  we are in the midst of massive change. And that change is forcing us to question quite fundamental aspects of our society    how we keep ourselves healthy  how we govern ourselves  how we educate ourselves  how we keep ourselves secure. And in these times of change  we need these new choices because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete. So why design thinking  Because it gives us a new way of tackling problems. Instead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach where we make the best choice out of available alternatives  it encourages us to take a divergent approach  to explore new alternatives  new solutions  new ideas that have not existed before. But before we go through that process of divergence  there is actually quite an important first step. And that is  what is the question that we're trying to answer  What's the design brief  Now Brunel may have asked a question like this   How do I take a train from London to New York   But what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today  So these are some that we've been asked to think about recently. And one in particular  is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund  in a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. How might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world's poorest people  and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers  So instead of having a bunch of American designers come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate  we took a sort of more open  collaborative and participative approach. We teamed designers and investment experts up with    water organizations across India. And through workshops they developed innovative new products  services  and business models. We hosted a competition and then funded five of those organizations to develop their ideas. So they developed and iterated these ideas. And then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them to help design new social marketing campaigns  community outreach strategies  business models  new water vessels for storing water and carts for delivering water. Some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market. And the same process is just getting underway with NGOs in East Africa. So for me  this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that I was working on at the beginning of my career. That by focusing on the needs of humans and by using prototypes to move ideas along quickly  by getting the process out of the hands of designers  and by getting the active participation of the community  we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions. And just like Brunel  by focusing on systems  we can have a bigger impact. So that's one thing that we've been working on. I'm actually really quite interested  and perhaps more interested to know what this community thinks we could work on. What kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tackle  And if you've got any ideas then feel free  you can post them to Twitter. There is a hash tag there that you can use   CBDQ. And the list looked something like this a little while ago. And of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested in by using the same hash code. So I'd like to believe that design thinking actually can make a difference  that it can help create new ideas and new innovations  beyond the latest High Street products. To do that I think we have to take a more expansive view of design  more like Brunel  less a domain of a professional priesthood. And the first step is to start asking the right questions. Thank you very much. For years I've been feeling frustrated  because as a religious historian  I've become acutely aware of the centrality of compassion in all the major world faiths. Every single one of them has evolved their own version of what's been called the Golden Rule. Sometimes it comes in a positive version     Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself.  And equally important is the negative version     Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you.  Look into your own heart  discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse  under any circumstance whatsoever  to inflict that pain on anybody else. And people have emphasized the importance of compassion  not just because it sounds good  but because it works. People have found that when they have implemented the Golden Rule as Confucius said   all day and every day   not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then returning to a life of greed and egotism  but to do it all day and every day  you dethrone yourself from the center of your world  put another there  and you transcend yourself. And it brings you into the presence of what's been called God  Nirvana  Rama  Tao. Something that goes beyond what we know in our ego bound existence. But you know you'd never know it a lot of the time  that this was so central to the religious life. Because with a few wonderful exceptions  very often when religious people come together  religious leaders come together  they're arguing about abstruse doctrines or uttering a council of hatred or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort. Often people don't really want to be compassionate. I sometimes see when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead. And that of course defeats the object of the exercise. Now why was I so grateful to TED  Because they took me very gently from my book lined study and brought me into the   st century  enabling me to speak to a much  much wider audience than I could have ever conceived. Because I feel an urgency about this. If we don't manage to implement the Golden Rule globally  so that we treat all peoples  wherever and whoever they may be  as though they were as important as ourselves  I doubt that we'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation. The task of our time  one of the great tasks of our time  is to build a global society  as I said  where people can live together in peace. And the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem. And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule. This is the source of all morality  this imaginative act of empathy  putting yourself in the place of another. And so we have a choice  it seems to me. We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith  or we can go back to the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel  the older contemporary of Jesus  who  when asked by a pagan to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg  said   That which is hateful to you  do not do to your neighbor. That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary.  And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate. And we need to revive that spirit. And it's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down. We have to make this happen  and we can do it with the modern communications that TED has introduced. Already I've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners. In Singapore  we have a group going to use the Charter to heal divisions recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society  and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically. In Malaysia  there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to be taking people  young people  and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art. Throughout Europe  the Muslim communities are holding events and discussions  are discussing the centrality of compassion in Islam and in all faiths. But it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch. Religious teaching  this is where we've gone so wrong  concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines. Religious teaching must always lead to action. And I intend to work on this till my dying day. And I want to continue with our partners to do two things    educate and stimulate compassionate thinking. Education because we've so dropped out of compassion. People often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody. But of course you don't understand compassion if you're just going to think about it. You also have to do it. I want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people  which are dividing us from one another. The same applies to educators. I'd like youth to get a sense of the dynamism  the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle. And also see that it demands acute intelligence  not just a gooey feeling. I'd like to call upon scholars to explore the compassionate theme in their own and in other people's traditions. And perhaps above all  to encourage a sensitivity about uncompassionate speaking  so that because people have this Charter  whatever their beliefs or lack of them  they feel empowered to challenge uncompassionate speech  disdainful remarks from their religious leaders  their political leaders  from the captains of industry. Because we can change the world  we have the ability. I would never have thought of putting the Charter online. I was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room and issuing yet another arcane statement. And TED introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas. Because that is what is so wonderful about TED. In this room  all this expertise  if we joined it all together  we could change the world. And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable. But I'd just like to quote  finish at the end with a reference to a British author  an Oxford author whom I don't quote very often  C.S. Lewis. But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl. It's in his book  The Four Loves.  He said that he distinguished between erotic love  when two people gaze  spellbound  into each other's eyes. And then he compared that to friendship  when two people stand side by side  as it were  shoulder to shoulder  with their eyes fixed on a common goal. We don't have to fall in love with each other  but we can become friends. And I am convinced. I felt it very strongly during our little deliberations at Vevey  that when people of all different persuasions come together  working side by side for a common goal  differences melt away. And we learn amity. And we learn to live together and to get to know one another. Thank you very much. I have a very difficult task. I'm a spectroscopist. I have to talk about astronomy without showing you any single image of nebulae or galaxies  etc. because my job is spectroscopy. I never deal with images. But I'll try to convince you that spectroscopy is actually something which can change this world. Spectroscopy can probably answer the question   Is there anybody out there   Are we alone  SETI. It's not very fun to do spectroscopy. One of my colleagues in Bulgaria  Nevena Markova  spent about    years studying these profiles. And she published    articles just dedicated to the subject. Can you imagine  Day and night  thinking  observing  the same star for    years is incredible. But we are crazy. We do these things. And I'm not that far. I spent about eight months working on these profiles. Because I've noticed a very small symmetry in the profile of one of the planet host stars. And I thought  well maybe there is Lithium   in this star  which is an indication that this star has swallowed a planet. Because apparently you can't have this fragile isotope of Lithium   in the atmospheres of sun like stars. But you have it in planets and asteroids. So if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids  you will have this Lithium   isotope in the spectrum of the star. So I invested more than eight months just studying the profile of this star. And actually it's amazing  because I got phone calls from many reporters asking   Have you actually seen the planet going into a star   Because they thought that if you are having a telescope  you are an astronomer so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescope. And you might have seen the planet going into a star. And I was saying   No  excuse me. What I see is this one.  It's just incredible. Because nobody understood really. I bet that there were very few people who really understood what I'm talking about. Because this is the indication that the planet went into the star. It's amazing. The power of spectroscopy was actually realized by Pink Floyd already in     . Because they actually said that you can get any color you like in a spectrum. And all you need is time and money to make your spectrograph. This is the number one high resolution  most precise spectrograph on this planet  called HARPS  which is actually used to detect extrasolar planets and sound waves in the atmospheres of stars. How we get spectra  I'm sure most of you know from school physics that it's basically splitting a white light into colors. And if you have a liquid hot mass  it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum. A hot gas is producing emission lines only  no continuum. And if you place a cool gas in front of a hot source  you will see certain patterns which we call absorption lines. Which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter  which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies. Now  what we can do with the spectra  We can actually study line of sight velocities of cosmic objects. And we can also study chemical composition and physical parameters of stars  galaxies  nebulae. A star is the most simple object. In the core  we have thermonuclear reactions going on  creating chemical elements. And we have a cool atmosphere. It's cool for me. Cool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees. My colleagues in infra red astronomy call minus     Kelvin is cool for them. But you know  everything is relative. So for me       degrees is pretty cool. This is the spectrum of the Sun           spectral lines  and about    percent of these lines is not yet identified. It is amazing. So we are in the   st century  and we still cannot properly understand the spectrum of the sun. Sometimes we have to deal with just one tiny  weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere. For instance  you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun. And we use this weak feature to measure the composition of gold in the atmosphere of the Sun. And now this is a work in progress. We have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature  which belongs to osmium. It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae. It's the only place where you can produce  actually  osmium. Just comparing the composition of osmium in one of the planet host stars  we want to understand why there is so much of this element. Perhaps we even think that maybe supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars. It can be an indication. The other day  my colleague from Berkeley  Gibor Basri  emailed me a very interesting spectrum  asking me   Can you have a look at this   And I couldn't sleep  next two weeks  when I saw the huge amount of oxygen and other elements in the spectrum of the stars. I knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy. It was incredible. The only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system  which polluted the atmosphere of this star. And later a black hole was formed in a binary system  which is still there with a mass of about five solar masses. This was considered as first evidence that actually black holes come from supernovae explosions. My colleagues  comparing composition of chemical elements in different galactic stars  actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy. It's amazing that you can go so far simply studying the chemical composition of stars. They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien. It comes from a different galaxy. There is interaction of galaxies. We know this. And sometimes they just capture stars. You've heard about solar flares. We were very surprised to discover a super flare  a flare which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those we see in the Sun. In one of the binary stars in our galaxy called FH Leo  we discovered the super flare. And later we went to study the spectral stars to see is there anything strange with these objects. And we found that everything is normal. These stars are normal like the Sun. Age  everything was normal. So this is a mystery. It's one of the mysteries we still have  super flares. And there are six or seven similar cases reported in the literature. Now to go ahead with this  we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe. It's very complicated. I don't really want you to try to understand what is here. But it's to show you how complicated is the whole story of the production of chemical elements. You have two channels    the massive stars and low mass stars    producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe. And doing this for    billion years  we end up with this picture  which is a very important graph  showing relative abundances of chemical elements in sun like stars and in the interstellar medium. So which means that it's really impossible to find an object where you find about    times more sulfur than silicon  five times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible. And if you find one  I will say that this is something related to SETI  because naturally you can't do it. Doppler Effect is something very important from fundamental physics. And this is related to the change of the frequency of a moving source. The Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets. The precision which we need to discover a Jupiter like planet around a sun like star is something like   .  meters per second. And we need nine centimeters per second to detect an Earth like planet. This can be done with the future spectrographs. I  myself  I'm actually involved in the team which is developing a CODEX  high resolution  future generation spectrograph for the    meter E ELT telescope. And this is going to be an instrument to detect Earth like planets around sun like stars. It is an amazing tool called astroseismology where we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of stars. This is the sound of an Alpha Cen. We can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of sun like stars. Those waves have frequencies in infrasound domain  the sound actually nobody knows  domain. Coming back to the most important question   Is there anybody out there   This is closely related to tectonic and volcanic activity of planets. Connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward. No life without tectonic activity  without volcanic activity. And we know very well that geothermal energy is mostly produced by decay of uranium  thorium  and potassium. How to measure  if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small  so those planets are tectonically dead  there cannot be life. If there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium  probably  again  there would be no life. Because can you imagine everything boiling  It's too much energy on a planet. Now  we have been measuring abundance of thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets. It's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature. We are actually trying to measure this profile and to detect thorium. It's very tough. It's very tough. And you have to  first you have to convince yourself. Then you have to convince your colleagues. And then you have to convince the whole world that you have actually detected something like this in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet host star somewhere in     parsec away from here. It's really difficult. But if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets  you have to do this job. Because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have in those systems. The one way to discover about aliens is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals. If you receive something interesting  well that's what SETI does actually  what SETI has been doing for many years. I think the most promising way is to go for biomarkers. You can see the spectrum of the Earth  this Earthshine spectrum  and that is a very clear signal. The slope which is coming  which we call a Red Edge  is a detection of vegetated area. It's amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum. Now imagine doing this test for other planets. Now very recently  very recently  I'm talking about last six  seven  eight months  water  methane  carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system. It's amazing. So this is the power of spectroscopy. You can actually go and detect and study a chemical composition of planets far  far  far from solar system. We have to detect oxygen or ozone to make sure that we have all necessary conditions to have life. Cosmic miracles are something which can be related to SETI. Now imagine an object  amazing object  or something which we cannot explain when we just stand up and say   Look  we give up. Physics doesn't work.  So it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say   Well  somebody must be doing this  somehow.  And with the known physics etc  it's something actually which has been pointed out by Frank Drake  many years ago  and Shklovsky. If you see  in the spectrum of a planet host star  if you see strange chemical elements  it can be a signal from a civilization which is there and they want to signal about it. They want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines  in the spectrum of a star  in different ways. There can be different ways doing this. One is  for instance  technetium is a radioactive element with a decay time of  .  million years. If you suddenly observe technetium in a sun like star  you can be sure that somebody has put this element in the atmosphere  because in a natural way it is impossible to do this. Now we are reviewing the spectra of about     stars with extrasolar planets. And we are doing this job since      and it's a very heavy project. We have been working very hard. And we have some interesting cases  candidates  so on  things which we can't really explain. And I hope in the near future we can confirm this. So the main question   Are we alone   I think it will not come from UFOs. It will not come from radio signals. I think it will come from a spectrum like this. It is the spectrum of a planet like Earth  showing a presence of nitrogen dioxide  as a clear signal of life  and oxygen and ozone. If  one day  and I think it will be within    years from now  or    years. If we discover a spectrum like this we can be sure that there is life on that planet. In about five years we will discover planets like Earth  around sun like stars  the same distance as the Earth from the Sun. It will take about five years. And then we will need another        years with space projects to get the spectra of Earth like planets like the one I showed you. And if we see the nitrogen dioxide and oxygen  I think we have the perfect E.T. Thank you very much. I run a design studio in New York. Every seven years  I close it for one year to pursue some little experiments  things that are always difficult to accomplish during the regular working year. In that year  we are not available for any of our clients. We are totally closed. And as you can imagine  it is a lovely and very energetic time. I originally had opened the studio in New York to combine my two loves  music and design. And we created videos and packaging for many musicians that you know  and for even more that you've never heard of. As I realized  just like with many many things in my life that I actually love  I adapt to it. And I get  over time  bored by them. And for sure  in our case  our work started to look the same. You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book. Quite the similar idea  then  a perfume packaged in a book  in a die cut. So I decided to close it down for one year. Also is the knowledge that right now we spend about in the first    years of our lives learning  then there is another    years that's really reserved for working. And then tacked on at the end of it are about    years for retirement. And I thought it might be helpful to basically cut off five of those retirement years and intersperse them in between those working years. That's clearly enjoyable for myself. But probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large  rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two. There is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago  Jonathan Haidt  who defined his work into three different levels. And they rang very true for me. I can see my work as a job. I do it for money. I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays. And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism. In a career I'm definitely more engaged. But at the same time  there will be periods when I think is all that really hard work really worth my while  While in the third one  in the calling  very much likely I would do it also if I wouldn't be financially compensated for it. I am not a religious person myself  but I did look for nature. I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City. Looked for something different for the second one. Europe and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing because I knew them too well. So Asia it was. The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia were Sri Lanka and Bali. Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on  so Bali it was. It's a wonderful  very craft oriented society. I arrived there in September       and pretty much started to work right away. There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself. However the first thing that I needed was mosquito repellent typography because they were definitely around heavily. And then I needed some sort of way to be able to get back to all the wild dogs that surround my house  and attacked me during my morning walks. So we created this series of    portraits on tee shirts. Every single dog on one tee shirt. As a little retaliation with a just ever so slightly menacing message on the back of the shirt. Just before I left New York I decided I could actually renovate my studio. And then just leave it all to them. And I don't have to do anything. So I looked for furniture. And it turned out that all the furniture that I really liked  I couldn't afford. And all the stuff I could afford  I didn't like. So one of the things that we pursued in Bali was pieces of furniture. This one  of course  still works with the wild dogs. It's not quite finished yet. And I think by the time this lamp came about  I had finally made peace with those dogs. Then there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table. It's called Be Here Now. It includes     compasses. And we had custom espresso cups made that hide a magnet inside  and make those compasses go crazy  always centering on them. Then this is a fairly talkative  verbose kind of chair. I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali. And at the same time  I'm extremely aware how boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses. So I will not really go too far into it. Many of you will know this TEDster  Danny Gilbert  whose book  actually  I got it through the TED book club. I think it took me four years to finally read it  while on sabbatical. And I was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical. And I'll show you a couple of people that did well by pursuing sabbaticals. This is Ferran Adria. Many people think he is right now the best chef in the world with his restaurant north of Barcelona  El Bulli. His restaurant is open seven months every year. He closes it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff. His latest numbers are fairly impressive. He can seat  throughout the year  he can seat       people. And he has  .  million requests for reservations. If I look at my cycle  seven years  one year sabbatical  it's   .  percent of my time. And if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine   M since the     s is giving all their engineers    percent to pursue whatever they want. There is some good successes. Scotch tape came out of this program  as well as Art Fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for  M. Google  of course  very famously gives    percent for their software engineers to pursue their own personal projects. Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical  That's about five percent of everybody. So I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up. Talk to them about if it was successful or not. I've found that finding out about what I'm going to like in the future  my very best way is to talk to people who have actually done it much better than myself envisioning it. When I had the idea of doing one  the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book. And then I told as many  many people as I possibly could about it so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on. In the beginning  on the first sabbatical  it was rather disastrous. I had thought that I should do this without any plan  that this vacuum of time somehow would be wonderful and enticing for idea generation. It was not. I just  without a plan  I just reacted to little requests  not work requests  those I all said no to  but other little requests. Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that. So I became my own intern. And I very quickly made a list of the things I was interested in  put them in a hierarchy  divided them into chunks of time and then made a plan  very much like in grade school. What does it say here  Monday    to    story writing    to     future thinking. Was not very successful. And so on and so forth. And that actually  specifically as a starting point of the first sabbatical  worked really well for me. What came out of it  I really got close to design again. I had fun. Financially  seen over the long term  it was actually successful. Because of the improved quality  we could ask for higher prices. And probably most importantly  basically everything we've done in the seven years following the first sabbatical came out of thinking of that one single year. And I'll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical. One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was that sameness is so incredibly overrated. This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few strand of companies  and not for everybody else. We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica  the Rem Koolhaas built music center in Porto  in Portugal. And even though I desired to do an identity that doesn't use the architecture  I failed at that. And mostly also because I realized out of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto  where he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning. Which I understood after I translated it from architecture speech in to regular English  basically as logo making. And I understood that the building itself was a logo. So then it became quite easy. We put a mask on it  looked at it deep down in the ground  checked it out from all sides  west  north  south  east  top and bottom. Colored them in a very particular way by having a friend of mine write a piece of software  the Casa da Musica Logo Generator. That's connected to a scanner. You put any image in there  like that Beethoven image. And the software  in a second  will give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo. Which  when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster  comes in handy  because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same. So it will always fit together  conceptually  of course. If Zappa's music is performed  it gets its own logo. Or Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers  who all performed there  get their own Casa da Musica logo. It works the same internally with the president or the musical director  whose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards. There is a full blown orchestra living inside the building. It has a more transparent identity. The truck they go on tour with. Or there's a smaller contemporary orchestra     people that remixes its own title. And one of the handy things that came about was that you could take the logo type and create advertising out of it. Like this Donna Toney poster  or Chopin  or Mozart  or La Monte Young. You can take the shape and make typography out of it. You can grow it underneath the skin. You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house  or a rave underneath the house or a weekly program  as well as educational services. Second insight. So far  until that point I had been mostly involved or used the language of design for promotional purposes  which was fine with me. On one hand I have nothing against selling. My parents are both salespeople. But I did feel that I spent so much time learning this language  why do I only promote with it  There must be something else. And the whole series of work came out of it. Some of you might have seen it. I showed some of it at earlier TEDs before  under the title  Things I've Learned in My Life So Far.  I'll just show two now. This is a whole wall of bananas at different ripenesses on the opening day in this gallery in New York. It says   Self confidence produces fine results.  This is after a week. After two weeks  three weeks  four weeks  five weeks. And you see the self confidence almost comes back  but not quite. These are some pictures visitors sent to me. And then the city of Amsterdam gave us a plaza and asked us to do something. We used the stone plates as a grid for our little piece. We got         coins from the central bank  at different darknesses. So we got brand new ones  shiny ones  medium ones  and very old  dark ones. And with the help of     volunteers  over a week  created this fairly floral typography that spelled   Obsessions make my life worse and my work better.  And the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between   Should I really take as much money as I can  Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now   While we built all this up during that week  with the     volunteers  a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it. So when it was finally done  and in the first night a guy came with big plastic bags and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry  one of the neighbors called the police. And the Amsterdam police in all their wisdom  came  saw  and they wanted to protect the artwork. And they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters. I think you see  you see them sweeping. You see them sweeping right here. That's the police  getting rid of it all. So after eight hours that's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing. We are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali. It's a movie about happiness. And here we asked some nearby pigs to do the titles for us. They weren't quite slick enough. So we asked the goose to do it again  and hoped she would do somehow  a more elegant or pretty job. And I think she overdid it. Just a bit too ornamental. And my studio is very close to the monkey forest. And the monkeys in that monkey forest looked  actually  fairly happy. So we asked those guys to do it again. They did a fine job  but had a couple of readability problems. So of course whatever you don't really do yourself doesn't really get done properly. That film we'll be working on for the next two years. So it's going to be a while. And of course you might think that doing a film on happiness might not really be worthwhile. Then you can of course always go and see this guy. Video   Laughter  And I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive. Stefan Sagmeister  Thank you. How do you feed a city  It's one of the great questions of our time. Yet it's one that's rarely asked. We take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant  or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time  there is going to be food there waiting for us  having magically come from somewhere. But when you think that every day for a city the size of London  enough food has to be produced  transported  bought and sold  cooked  eaten  disposed of  and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth  it's remarkable that cities get fed at all. We live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world  forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat  we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were. And as more of us move into cities  more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me    it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil    in order to feed us. These are extraordinary landscapes  but few of us ever get to see them. And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either. As more of us move into cities  more of us are eating meat  so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals. And given that it takes three times as much grain    actually ten times as much grain    to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first  that's not a very efficient way of feeding us. And it's an escalating problem too. By       it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities. And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed. So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand. And that's going to pose an enormous problem. Six billion hungry carnivores to feed  by     . That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are  it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve. Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land. Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion. We're very hungry for fossil fuels too. It takes about    calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West. And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost  we don't actually value it. Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away. And to end all of this  at the end of this long process  we're not even managing to feed the planet properly. A billion of us are obese  while a further billion starve. None of it makes very much sense. And when you think that    percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations  it's a grim picture. As we're moving into cities  the world is also embracing a Western diet. And if we look to the future  it's an unsustainable diet. So how did we get here  And more importantly  what are we going to do about it  Well  to answer the slightly easier question first  about        years ago  I would say  is the beginning of this process in the ancient Near East  known as the Fertile Crescent. Because  as you can see  it was crescent shaped. And it was also fertile. And it was here  about        years ago  that two extraordinary inventions  agriculture and urbanism  happened roughly in the same place and at the same time. This is no accident  because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other. Because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements. And if we look at what those settlements were like  we see they were compact. They were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at Ur  that were  in fact  effectively  spiritualized  central food distribution centers. Because it was the temples that organized the harvest  gathered in the grain  offered it to the gods  and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people. So  if you like  the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them. And in fact  that's true of every ancient city. But of course not all of them were that small. Famously  Rome had about a million citizens by the first century A.D. So how did a city like this feed itself  The answer is what I call  ancient food miles.  Basically  Rome had access to the sea  which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away. This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world  because it was very difficult to transport food over roads  which were rough. And the food obviously went off very quickly. So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves. And  in fact  you could say that the expansion of the Empire was really sort of one long  drawn out militarized shopping spree  really. In fact    I love the fact  I just have to mention this  Rome in fact used to import oysters from London  at one stage. I think that's extraordinary. So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite. But the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre industrial world. If we look at a map of London in the   th century  we can see that its grain  which is coming in from the Thames  along the bottom of this map. So the grain markets were to the south of the city. And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside  which was the main market  were also grain markets. And if you look at the name of one of those streets  Bread Street  you can tell what was going on there     years ago. And the same of course was true for fish. Fish was  of course  coming in by river as well. Same thing. And of course Billingsgate  famously  was London's fish market  operating on site here until the mid     s. Which is extraordinary  really  when you think about it. Everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port. This is another thing about food in cities  Once its roots into the city are established  they very rarely move. Meat is a very different story because  of course  animals could walk into the city. So much of London's meat was coming from the northwest  from Scotland and Wales. So it was coming in  and arriving at the city at the northwest  which is why Smithfield  London's very famous meat market  was located up there. Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on  to the northeast. I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway  and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes. And then when they hit the eastern end of Cheapside  that's where they were sold  which is why it's called Poultry. And  in fact  if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age  you can trace food coming in to it. You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food  both by reading the names of the streets  which give you a lot of clues. Friday Street  in a previous life  is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday. But also you have to imagine it full of food. Because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold. And if we look at an image of Smithfield in      you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from. In fact  if you were having Sunday lunch  the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier. So this was obviously an organic city  part of an organic cycle. And then    years later everything changed. This is an image of the Great Western in     . And as you can see  some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep. So all of a sudden  these animals are no longer walking into market. They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind  somewhere in the countryside. And they're coming into the city by rail. And this changes everything. To start off with  it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities  really any size and shape  in any place. Cities used to be constrained by geography  they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means. All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography. And as you can see from these maps of London  in the    years after the trains came  it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot  and so on  to a large splurge  that would be very  very difficult to feed with anybody on foot  either animals or people. And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars  and really this marks the end of this process. It's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all. And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell  devoid of mess  certainly devoid of people  because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape. In fact  what they did to get food was they got in their cars  drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts  came back with a week's worth of shopping  and wondered what on earth to do with it. And this really is the moment when our relationship  both with food and cities  changes completely. Here we have food    that used to be the center  the social core of the city    at the periphery. It used to be a social event  buying and selling food. Now it's anonymous. We used to cook  now we just add water  or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something. We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat. We just read the back of a label on a packet. And we don't value food. We don't trust it. So instead of trusting it  we fear it. And instead of valuing it  we throw it away. One of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder. By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place  they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship  which is that of us and nature. And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver  that  as we've seen  are unsustainable. So what are we going to do about that  It's not a new question.     years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself. This is the frontispiece of his book  Utopia.  And it was a series of semi independent city states  if that sounds remotely familiar  a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming mad  and grew vegetables in their back gardens  and ate communal meals together  and so on. And I think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia  even though More never framed it that way. And here is another very famous  Utopian  vision  that of Ebenezer Howard   The Garden City.  Same idea  series of semi independent city states  little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around  joined to one another by railway. And again  food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision. It even got built  but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had. And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas  that they are Utopian. Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately. It was a kind of joke  because it's got a double derivation from the Greek. It can either mean a good place  or no place. Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it. And I think  as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling  that makes it not much use. So I've come up with an alternative  which is Sitopia  from the ancient Greek   sitos  for food  and  topos  for place. I believe we already live in Sitopia. We live in a world shaped by food  and if we realize that  we can use food as a really powerful tool    a conceptual tool  design tool  to shape the world differently. So if we were to do that  what might Sitopia look like  Well I think it looks a bit like this. I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog. But anyway  this is     Laughter  it's food at the center of life  at the center of family life  being celebrated  being enjoyed  people taking time for it. This is where food should be in our society. But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this. By the way  these can be men as well. It's people who think about food  who think ahead  who plan  who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them. We need these people. We're part of a network. Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this. Here  I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable. But networks  markets where food is being grown locally. It's common. It's fresh. It's part of the social life of the city. Because without that  you can't have this kind of place  food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape  and is not just a zero sum commodity off in some unseen hell hole. Cows with a view. Steaming piles of humus. This is basically bringing the whole thing together. And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto. It's a greenhouse  where kids get told all about food and growing their own food. Here is a plant called Kevin  or maybe it's a plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know. But anyway  these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important. So Sitopia  for me  is really a way of seeing. It's basically recognizing that Sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere. The trick is to join them up  to use food as a way of seeing. And if we do that  we're going to stop seeing cities as big  metropolitan  unproductive blobs  like this. We're going to see them more like this  as part of the productive  organic framework of which they are inevitably a part  symbiotically connected. But of course  that's not a great image either  because we need not to be producing food like this anymore. We need to be thinking more about permaculture  which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing. It's a re conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives. The best image I know of this is from     years ago. It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's  Allegory of Good Government.  It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside. And I think the message of this is very clear. If the city looks after the country  the country will look after the city. And I want us to ask now  what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today  What would an allegory of good government look like today  Because I think it's an urgent question. It's one we have to ask  and we have to start answering. We know we are what we eat. We need to realize that the world is also what we eat. But if we take that idea  we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better. Thank you very much. What we're really here to talk about is the  how.  Okay  so how exactly do we create this world shattering  if you will  innovation  Now  I want to tell you a quick story. We'll go back a little more than a year. In fact  the date    I'm curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date  It was February  rd      . Anyone remember what happened  February  rd        Super Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl. And the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues  John King and Halee Fischer Wright  and I noticed as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties  is that it seemed to us that across the United States  if you will  tribal councils had convened. And they had discussed things of great national importance. Like   Do we like the Budweiser commercial   and   Do we like the nachos   and   Who is going to win   But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support. And if you go back in time to February  rd  it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination. And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way. But when we talked to people  it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the United States. Now what is a tribe  A tribe is a group of about       so kind of more than a team       to about     people. And it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done. But not just work. It's within these tribes that societies get built  that important things happen. And so as we surveyed the  if you will  representatives from various tribal councils that met  also known as Super Bowl parties  we sent the following email off to    newspaper editors the following day. February  th  we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday. We said   The tribes that we're in are saying it's going to be Obama.  Now  the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous    years studying tribes  studying these naturally occurring groups. All of you are members of tribes. In walking around at the break  many of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them. And many of you were doing what great  if you will  tribal leaders do  which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe  and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe  and make introductions. That is in fact what great tribal leaders do. So here is the bottom line. If you focus in on a group like this    this happens to be a USC game    and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people  you would in fact see not a single crowd  just like there is not a single crowd here  but you would see these tribes that are then coming together. And from a distance it appears that it's a single group. And so people form tribes. They always have. They always will. Just as fish swim and birds fly  people form tribes. It's just what we do. But here's the rub. Not all tribes are the same  and what makes the difference is the culture. Now here is the net out of this. You're all a member of tribes. If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in and nudge them forward  along these tribal stages to what we call Stage Five  which is the top of the mountain. But we're going to start with what we call Stage One. Now  this is the lowest of the stages. You don't want this. Okay  This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen. But it's one that I think we need to learn from. Stage One produces people who do horrible things. This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech. Stage One is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes  and then pool together with people who think like they do. Stage One is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons. Now  again  we don't often deal with Stage One. And I want to make the point that as members of society  we need to. It's not enough to simply write people off. But let's move on to Stage Two. Now  Stage One  you'll notice  says  in effect   Life Sucks.  So  this other book that Steve mentioned  that just came out  called  The Three Laws of Performance   my colleague  Steve Zaffron and I  argue that as people see the world  so they behave. Well  if people see the world in such a way that life sucks  then their behavior will follow automatically from that. It will be despairing hostility. They'll do whatever it takes to survive  even if that means undermining other people. Now  my birthday is coming up shortly  and my driver's license expires. And the reason that that's relevant is that very soon I will be walking into what we call a Stage Two tribe  which looks like this. Now  am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles across the land  you find a Stage Two culture  No. But in the one near me  where I have to go in just a few days  what I will say when I'm standing in line is   How can people be so dumb  and yet live   Now  am I saying that there are dumb people working here  Actually  no  I'm not. But I'm saying the culture makes people dumb. So in a Stage Two culture    and we find these in all sorts of different places    you find them  in fact  in the best organizations in the world. You find them in all places in society. I've come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class. But here is the point. If you believe and you say to people in your tribe  in effect   My life sucks. I mean  if I got to go to TEDx USC my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.  If that's how you talked  imagine what kind of work would get done. What kind of innovation would get done  The amount of world changing behavior that would happen  In fact it would be basically nil. Now when we go on to Stage Three  this is the one that hits closest to home for many of us. Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move. And we park. And we stay. Stage Three says   I'm great. And you're not.  I'm great and you're not. Now imagine having a whole room of people saying  in effect   I'm great and you're not.  Or   I'm going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that.  A whole group of people communicating that way  talking that way. I know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar. But  in this case  three doctors walk into an elevator. I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book. And one doctor said to the others   Did you see my article in the New England Journal of Medicine   And the other said   No. That's great. Congratulations   The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said   Well while you were  you know  doing your research      notice the condescending tone     While you were off doing your research  I was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution.  And the third one got the same wry smile and said   Well  while you were off doing your research  and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery  that eventually we'll train monkeys to do  or cells or robots  or maybe not even need to do it at all  I was off running the future of the residency program  which is really the future of medicine.  And they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back. And the elevator door opened  and they all walked out. That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe. Now  we find these in places where really smart  successful people show up. Like  oh  I don't know  TEDx USC. Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation. It is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four. Let's take a look at a quick video snippet. This is from a company called Zappos  located outside Las Vegas. And my question on the other side is just going to be   What do you think they value   It was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree. This is their lobby. Employees volunteer time in the advice booth. Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon. Okay  we're going through the hallway here at Zappos. This is a call center. Notice how it's decorated. Notice people are applauding for us. They don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did they probably wouldn't applaud. But you'll notice the level of excitement. Notice  again  how they decorate their office. Now  what's important to people at Zappos  these may not be the things that are important to you. But they value things like fun. And they value creativity. One of their stated values is   Be a little bit weird.  And you'll notice they are a little bit weird. So when individuals come together and find something that unites them that's greater than their individual competence  then something very important happens. The group gels. And it changes from a group of highly motivated but fairly individually centric people into something larger  into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence. Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things. But you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet. There is  in fact  another stage. Now  some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here. And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five  which is  Life is Great   this may seem a little incongruous. This is a scene or snippet from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa for which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize. Now think about that. South Africa  terrible atrocities had happened in the society. And people came together focused only on those two values  truth and reconciliation. There was no road map. No one had ever done anything like this before. And in this atmosphere  where the only guidance was people's values and their noble cause  what this group accomplished was historic. And people  at the time  feared that South Africa would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone  descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end. In fact  South Africa has not gone down that road. Largely because people like Desmond Tutu set up a Stage Five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country  to bring everyone together. So  people hear this and they conclude the following  as did we in doing the study. Okay  got it. I don't want to talk Stage One. That's like  you know   Life sucks.  Who wants to talk that way  I don't want to talk like they do at the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives. I really don't want to just say  I'm great   because that kind of sounds narcissistic  and then I won't have any friends. Saying   We're great     that sounds pretty good. But I should really talk Stage Five  right   Life is great.  Well  in fact  there are three somewhat counter intuitive findings that come out of all this. The first one  if you look at the Declaration of Independence and actually read it  the phrase that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights. I mean  that's Stage Five  right  Life is great  oriented only by our values  no other guidance. In fact  most of the document is written at Stage Two.  My life sucks because I live under a tyrant  also known as King George. We're great  Who is not great  England   Sorry.  Laughter  Well  what about other great leaders  What about Gandhi  What about Martin Luther King  I mean  surely these were just people who preached   Life is great   right  Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another. In fact  Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three. He didn't say  We have a dream.  He said   I have a dream.  Why did he do that  Because most people are not at Stage Five. Two percent are at Stage One. About    percent are at Stage Two  saying  in effect   My life sucks.     percent of working tribes say  these are employed tribes  say   I'm great and you're not.  And we have to duke it out every day  so we resort to politics. Only about    percent of tribes are at Stage Four  oriented by our values  saying  We're great. And our values are beginning to unite us.  Only two percent  only two percent of tribes get to Stage Five. And those are the ones that change the world. So the first little finding from this is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society. But you don't leave them where you found them. Okay  Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are. So we have to have the ability to talk all the levels  to go to where they are. And then leaders nudge people within their tribes to the next level. I'd like to show you some examples of this. One of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan  former Mayor of San Francisco. Before that he was Chief of Police in San Francisco. And he grew up essentially in Stage One. And you know what changed his life  It was walking into one of these  a Boys and Girls Club. Now here is what happened to this person who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco. He went from being alive and passionate at Stage One    remember   Life sucks  despairing hostility  I will do whatever it takes to survive     to walking into a Boys and Girls Club  folding his arms  sitting down in a chair  and saying   Wow. My life really sucks. I don't know anybody. I mean  if I was into boxing  like they were  then my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does. So I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything.  In fact  that's progress. We move people from Stage One to Stage Two by getting them in a new tribe and then  over time  getting them connected. So  what about moving from Stage Three to Stage Four  I want to argue that we're doing that right here. TED represents a set of values  and as we unite around these values  something really interesting begins to emerge. If you want this experience to live on as something historic  then at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do and call networking. Which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach  extend your influence  but instead  find someone you don't know  and find someone else you don't know  and introduce them. That's called a triadic relationship. See  people who build world changing tribes do that. They extend the reach of their tribes by connecting them  not just to myself  so that my following is greater  but I connect people who don't know each other to something greater than themselves. And ultimately that adds to their values. But we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four  which is great  to Stage Five  The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of a place called the Gallup Organization. You know they do polls  right  So it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great  Pretty much everybody else who does polls. If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll  people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay  we understand that. So  they were bored. They wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.  How could we  instead of just polling what Asia thinks or what the United States thinks  or who thinks what about Obama versus McCain or something like that  what does the entire world think   And they found a way to do the first ever world poll. They had people involved who were Nobel laureates in economics  who reported being bored. And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out   How do we survey the population of Sub Saharan Africa  How do we survey populations that don't have access to technology  and speak languages we don't speak  and we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order to achieve on this great mission  we have to be able to do it. Incidentally  they did pull it off. And they released the first ever world poll. So I'd like to leave you with these thoughts. First of all  we all form tribes  all of us. You're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reach of the tribes that you have. But the question on the table is this  What kind of an impact are the tribes that you are in making  You're hearing one presentation after another  often representing a group of people  a tribe  about how they have changed the world. If you do what we've talked about  you listen for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in. And you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward. You remember to talk all five culture stages. Because we've got people in all five  around us. And the question that I'd like to leave you with is this  Will your tribes change the world  Thank you very much. I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call  the danger of the single story.  I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two  although I think four is probably close to the truth. So I was an early reader  and what I read were British and American children's books. I was also an early writer  and when I began to write  at about the age of seven  stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read  I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading  All my characters were white and blue eyed  they played in the snow  they ate apples  and they talked a lot about the weather  how lovely it was that the sun had come out. Now  this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside Nigeria. We didn't have snow  we ate mangoes  and we never talked about the weather  because there was no need to. My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer  because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer. Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was. And for many years afterwards  I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer. But that is another story. What this demonstrates  I think  is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story  particularly as children. Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign  I had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify. Now  things changed when I discovered African books. There weren't many of them available  and they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books. But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye  I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature. I realized that people like me  girls with skin the color of chocolate  whose kinky hair could not form ponytails  could also exist in literature. I started to write about things I recognized. Now  I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature. So what the discovery of African writers did for me was this  It saved me from having a single story of what books are. I come from a conventional  middle class Nigerian family. My father was a professor. My mother was an administrator. And so we had  as was the norm  live in domestic help  who would often come from nearby rural villages. So  the year I turned eight  we got a new house boy. His name was Fide. The only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor. My mother sent yams and rice  and our old clothes  to his family. And when I didn't finish my dinner  my mother would say   Finish your food  Don't you know  People like Fide's family have nothing.  So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family. Then one Saturday  we went to his village to visit  and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made. I was startled. It had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something. All I had heard about them was how poor they were  so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor. Their poverty was my single story of them. Years later  I thought about this when I left Nigeria to go to university in the United States. I was   . My American roommate was shocked by me. She asked where I had learned to speak English so well  and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English as its official language. She asked if she could listen to what she called my  tribal music   and was consequently very disappointed when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey. She assumed that I did not know how to use a stove. What struck me was this  She had felt sorry for me even before she saw me. Her default position toward me  as an African  was a kind of patronizing  well meaning pity. My roommate had a single story of Africa  a single story of catastrophe. In this single story  there was no possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way  no possibility of feelings more complex than pity  no possibility of a connection as human equals. I must say that before I went to the U.S.  I didn't consciously identify as African. But in the U.S.  whenever Africa came up  people turned to me. Never mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia. But I did come to embrace this new identity  and in many ways I think of myself now as African. Although I still get quite irritable when Africa is referred to as a country  the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from Lagos two days ago  in which there was an announcement on the Virgin flight about the charity work in  India  Africa and other countries.  So  after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African  I began to understand my roommate's response to me. If I had not grown up in Nigeria  and if all I knew about Africa were from popular images  I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes  beautiful animals  and incomprehensible people  fighting senseless wars  dying of poverty and AIDS  unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind  white foreigner. I would see Africans in the same way that I  as a child  had seen Fide's family. This single story of Africa ultimately comes  I think  from Western literature. Now  here is a quote from the writing of a London merchant called John Locke  who sailed to west Africa in      and kept a fascinating account of his voyage. After referring to the black Africans as  beasts who have no houses   he writes   They are also people without heads  having their mouth and eyes in their breasts.  Now  I've laughed every time I've read this. And one must admire the imagination of John Locke. But what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling African stories in the West  A tradition of Sub Saharan Africa as a place of negatives  of difference  of darkness  of people who  in the words of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling  are  half devil  half child.  And so  I began to realize that my American roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of this single story  as had a professor  who once told me that my novel was not  authentically African.  Now  I was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel  that it had failed in a number of places  but I had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something called African authenticity. In fact  I did not know what African authenticity was. The professor told me that my characters were too much like him  an educated and middle class man. My characters drove cars. They were not starving. Therefore they were not authentically African. But I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty in the question of the single story. A few years ago  I visited Mexico from the U.S. The political climate in the U.S. at the time was tense  and there were debates going on about immigration. And  as often happens in America  immigration became synonymous with Mexicans. There were endless stories of Mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare system  sneaking across the border  being arrested at the border  that sort of thing. I remember walking around on my first day in Guadalajara  watching the people going to work  rolling up tortillas in the marketplace  smoking  laughing. I remember first feeling slight surprise. And then  I was overwhelmed with shame. I realized that I had been so immersed in the media coverage of Mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind  the abject immigrant. I had bought into the single story of Mexicans and I could not have been more ashamed of myself. So that is how to create a single story  show a people as one thing  as only one thing  over and over again  and that is what they become. It is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power. There is a word  an Igbo word  that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world  and it is  nkali.  It's a noun that loosely translates to  to be greater than another.  Like our economic and political worlds  stories too are defined by the principle of nkali  How they are told  who tells them  when they're told  how many stories are told  are really dependent on power. Power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person  but to make it the definitive story of that person. The Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people  the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with   secondly.  Start the story with the arrows of the Native Americans  and not with the arrival of the British  and you have an entirely different story. Start the story with the failure of the African state  and not with the colonial creation of the African state  and you have an entirely different story. I recently spoke at a university where a student told me that it was such a shame that Nigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel. I told him that I had just read a novel called  American Psycho        and that it was such a shame that young Americans were serial murderers. Now  obviously I said this in a fit of mild irritation. But it would never have occurred to me to think that just because I had read a novel in which a character was a serial killer that he was somehow representative of all Americans. This is not because I am a better person than that student  but because of America's cultural and economic power  I had many stories of America. I had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill. I did not have a single story of America. When I learned  some years ago  that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful  I began to think about how I could invent horrible things my parents had done to me. But the truth is that I had a very happy childhood  full of laughter and love  in a very close knit family. But I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps. My cousin Polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare. One of my closest friends  Okoloma  died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have water. I grew up under repressive military governments that devalued education  so that sometimes  my parents were not paid their salaries. And so  as a child  I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table  then margarine disappeared  then bread became too expensive  then milk became rationed. And most of all  a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives. All of these stories make me who I am. But to insist on only these negative stories is to flatten my experience and to overlook the many other stories that formed me. The single story creates stereotypes  and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue  but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story. Of course  Africa is a continent full of catastrophes  There are immense ones  such as the horrific rapes in Congo and depressing ones  such as the fact that       people apply for one job vacancy in Nigeria. But there are other stories that are not about catastrophe  and it is very important  it is just as important  to talk about them. I've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person. The consequence of the single story is this  It robs people of dignity. It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult. It emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar. So what if before my Mexican trip  I had followed the immigration debate from both sides  the U.S. and the Mexican  What if my mother had told us that Fide's family was poor and hardworking  What if we had an African television network that broadcast diverse African stories all over the world  What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe calls  a balance of stories.  What if my roommate knew about my Nigerian publisher  Muhtar Bakare  a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house  Now  the conventional wisdom was that Nigerians don't read literature. He disagreed. He felt that people who could read  would read  if you made literature affordable and available to them. Shortly after he published my first novel  I went to a TV station in Lagos to do an interview  and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said   I really liked your novel. I didn't like the ending. Now  you must write a sequel  and this is what will happen ...  And she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel. I was not only charmed  I was very moved. Here was a woman  part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians  who were not supposed to be readers. She had not only read the book  but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel. Now  what if my roommate knew about my friend Funmi Iyanda  a fearless woman who hosts a TV show in Lagos  and is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget  What if my roommate knew about the heart procedure that was performed in the Lagos hospital last week  What if my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music  talented people singing in English and Pidgin  and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo  mixing influences from Jay Z to Fela to Bob Marley to their grandfathers. What if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in Nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband's consent before renewing their passports  What if my roommate knew about Nollywood  full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds  films so popular that they really are the best example of Nigerians consuming what they produce  What if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider  who has just started her own business selling hair extensions  Or about the millions of other Nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail  but continue to nurse ambition  Every time I am home I am confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most Nigerians  our failed infrastructure  our failed government  but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive despite the government  rather than because of it. I teach writing workshops in Lagos every summer  and it is amazing to me how many people apply  how many people are eager to write  to tell stories. My Nigerian publisher and I have just started a non profit called Farafina Trust  and we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist and providing books for state schools that don't have anything in their libraries  and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops  in reading and writing  for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories. Stories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign  but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize. Stories can break the dignity of a people  but stories can also repair that broken dignity. The American writer Alice Walker wrote this about her Southern relatives who had moved to the North. She introduced them to a book about the Southern life that they had left behind.  They sat around  reading the book themselves  listening to me read the book  and a kind of paradise was regained.  I would like to end with this thought  That when we reject the single story  when we realize that there is never a single story about any place  we regain a kind of paradise. Thank you. I want to start with a game. Okay  And to win this game  all you have to do is see the reality that's in front of you as it really is  all right  So we have two panels here  of colored dots. And one of those dots is the same in the two panels. And you have to tell me which one. Now  I narrowed it down to the gray one  the green one  and  say  the orange one. So by a show of hands  we'll start with the easiest one. Show of hands  how many people think it's the gray one  Really  Okay. How many people think it's the green one  And how many people think it's the orange one  Pretty even split. Let's find out what the reality is. Here is the orange one. Here is the green one. And here is the gray one. So for all of you who saw that  you're complete realists. All right  So this is pretty amazing  isn't it  Because nearly every living system has evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another. So for us  seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does. And yet  even at this most fundamental level  context is everything. What I'm going to talk about is not that context is everything  but why context is everything. Because it's answering that question that tells us not only why we see what we do  but who we are as individuals  and who we are as a society. But first  we have to ask another question  which is   What is color for   And instead of telling you  I'll just show you. What you see here is a jungle scene  and you see the surfaces according to the amount of light that those surfaces reflect. Now  can any of you see the predator that's about to jump out at you  And if you haven't seen it yet  you're dead  right  Can anyone see it  Anyone  No  Now let's see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they reflect. And now you see it. So  color enables us to see the similarities and differences between surfaces  according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect. But what you've just done is in many respects mathematically impossible. Why  Because  as Berkeley tells us  we have no direct access to our physical world  other than through our senses. And the light that falls onto our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world  not only the color of objects  but also the color of their illumination  and the color of the space between us and those objects. You vary any one of those parameters  and you'll change the color of the light that falls onto your eye. This is a huge problem  because it means that the same image could have an infinite number of possible real world sources. Let me show you what I mean. Imagine that this is the back of your eye  okay  And these are two projections from the world. They're identical in every single way. Identical in shape  size  spectral content. They are the same  as far as your eye is concerned. And yet they come from completely different sources. The one on the right comes from a yellow surface  in shadow  oriented facing the left  viewed through a pinkish medium. The one on the left comes from an orange surface  under direct light  facing to the right  viewed through sort of a bluish medium. Completely different meanings  giving rise to the exact same retinal information. And yet it's only the retinal information that we get. So how on Earth do we even see  So if you remember anything in this next    minutes  remember this  that the light that falls onto your eye  sensory information  is meaningless  because it could mean literally anything. And what's true for sensory information is true for information generally. There's no inherent meaning in information. It's what we do with that information that matters. So  how do we see  Well  we see by learning to see. The brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns  finding relationships in information  and associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning  a significance  by interacting with the world. We're very aware of this in the form of more cognitive attributes  like language. I'm going to give you some letter strings  and I want you to read them out for me  if you can. Audience   Can you read this    You are not reading this.   What are you reading   Beau Lotto   What are you reading   Half the letters are missing  right  There's no a priori reason why an  H  has to go between that  W  and  A.  But you put one there. Why  Because in the statistics of your past experience  it would have been useful to do so. So you do so again. And yet you don't put a letter after that first  T.  Why  Because it wouldn't have been useful in the past. So you don't do it again. So  let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality  even at the simplest thing the brain does  which is color. So if I could have the lights down up here. I want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same. One is simply the flipping of the other. Now I want you to look at that dot between the green and the red. And I want you to stare at that dot. Don't look anywhere else. We're going to look at it for about    seconds  which is a bit of a killer in an    minute talk. But I really want you to learn. And I'll tell you    don't look anywhere else    I'll tell you what's happening in your head. Your brain is learning  and it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination  the left side of its visual field is under green illumination. That's what it's learning. Okay  Now  when I tell you  I want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes. So why don't you do that now  Can I have the lights up again  I take it from your response they don't look the same anymore  right  Why  Because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light  and the left one is still under green light. That's your new normal. Okay  So  what does this mean for context  It means I can take two identical squares  put them in light and dark surrounds  and the one on the dark surround looks lighter than on the light surround. What's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter. It's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past. So I'll show you what I mean. Here we have that exact same illusion. We have two identical tiles on the left  one in a dark surround  one in a light surround. And the same thing over on the right. Now  I'll reveal those two scenes  but I'm not going to change anything within those boxes  except their meaning. And see what happens to your perception. Notice that on the left the two tiles look nearly completely opposite  one very white and one very dark  right  Whereas on the right  the two tiles look nearly the same. And yet there is still one on a dark surround  and one on a light surround. Why  Because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow  and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow  it would have to be more reflective    just the laws of physics. So you see it that way. Whereas on the right  the information is consistent with those two tiles being under the same light. If they're under the same light reflecting the same amount of light to your eye  then they must be equally reflective. So you see it that way. Which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions. This is one I made a few years ago. And you'll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top  and a bright orange tile at the side. That is your perceptual reality. The physical reality is that those two tiles are the same. Here you see four gray tiles on your left  seven gray tiles on the right. I'm not going to change those tiles at all  but I'm going to reveal the rest of the scene. And see what happens to your perception. The four blue tiles on the left are gray. The seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray. They are the same. Okay  Don't believe me  Let's watch it again. What's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion. So  here we have    let's turn this around    a diamond. And what I'm going to do is  I'm going to hold it here  and I'm going to spin it. And for all of you  you'll see it probably spinning this direction. Now I want you to keep looking at it. Move your eyes around  blink  maybe close one eye. And suddenly it will flip  and start spinning the opposite direction. Yes  Raise your hand if you got that. Yes  Keep blinking. Every time you blink  it will switch. So I can ask you  which direction is it rotating  How do you know  Your brain doesn't know  because both are equally likely. So depending on where it looks  it flips between the two possibilities. Are we the only ones that see illusions  The answer to this question is no. Even the beautiful bumblebee  with its mere one million brain cells  which is     times fewer cells than you have in one retina  sees illusions  does the most complicated things that even our most sophisticated computers can't do. So in my lab we work on bumblebees  because we can completely control their experience  and see how it alters the architecture of their brain. We do this in what we call the Bee Matrix. Here you have the hive. You can see the queen bee  the large bee in the middle. Those are her daughters  the eggs. They go back and forth between this hive and the arena  via this tube. You'll see one of the bees come out here. You see how she has a little number on her  There's another one coming out  she also has a number on her. Now  they're not born that way  right  We pull them out  put them in the fridge  and they fall asleep. Then you can superglue little numbers on them. And now  in this experiment they get a reward if they go to the blue flowers. They land on the flower  stick their tongue in there  called a proboscis  and drink sugar water. She's drinking a glass of water that's about that big to you and I  will do that about three times  then fly. And sometimes they learn not to go to the blue  but to go where the other bees go. So they copy each other. They can count to five. They can recognize faces. And here she comes down the ladder. And she'll come into the hive  find an empty honey pot  and throw up  and that's honey. Now remember  she's supposed to be going to the blue flowers  but what are these bees doing in the upper right corner  It looks like they're going to green flowers. Now  are they getting it wrong  And the answer to the question is no. Those are actually blue flowers. But those are blue flowers under green light. So they're using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle  which is exactly what we do. So  illusions are often used  especially in art  in the words of a more contemporary artist   to demonstrate the fragility of our senses.  Okay  this is complete rubbish. The senses aren't fragile. And if they were  we wouldn't be here. Instead  color tells us something completely different  that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is. We can't. Instead  the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past. And how we see is by continually redefining normality. So  how can we take this incredible capacity of plasticity of the brain and get people to experience their world differently  Well  one of the ways we do it in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound  and we enable people to hear their visual world. And they can navigate the world using their ears. Here's David on the right  and he's holding a camera. On the left is what his camera sees. And you'll see there's a faint line going across that image. That line is broken up into    squares. In each square  we calculate the average color. And then we just simply translate that into sound. And now he's going to turn around  close his eyes  and find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed. Beau Lotto  He finds it. Amazing  right  So not only can we create a prosthetic for the visually impaired  but we can also investigate how people literally make sense of the world. But we can also do something else. We can also make music with color. So  working with kids  they created images  thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them. And then we translated these images. And this is one of those images. And this is a six year old child composing a piece of music for a    piece orchestra. And this is what it sounds like. So  a six year old child. Okay  Now  what does all this mean  What this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature  okay  We're not defined by our central properties  by the bits that make us up. We're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment  by our ecology. And that ecology is necessarily relative  historical and empirical. So  what I'd like to finish with is this over here. Because what I've been trying to do is really celebrate uncertainty. Because I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding. So  if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain  I'd like to do this one. So  if we have the lights down. And what we have here    Can everyone see    purple surfaces on your left  and     call it yellowish  surfaces on your right  So now  what I want to do  I'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination  by simply putting a filter behind them. Now you can see that changes the light that's coming through there  right  Because now the light is going through a yellowish filter and then a purplish filter. I'm going to do the opposite on the left here. I'm going to put the middle nine under a purplish light. Now  some of you will have noticed that the consequence is that the light coming through those middle nine on the right  or your left  is exactly the same as the light coming through the middle nine on your right. Agreed  Yes  Okay. So they are physically the same. Let's pull the covers off. Now remember    you know that the middle nine are exactly the same. Do they look the same  No. The question is   Is that an illusion   And I'll leave you with that. So  thank you very much. So  I am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves  but first I want to tell you why I'm here. I'm here for two reasons. These two guys are my two sons Ford and Wren. When Ford was about three years old  we shared a very small room together  in a very small space. My office was on one half of the bedroom  and his bedroom was on the other half. And you can imagine  if you're a writer  that things would get really crowded around deadlines. So when Wren was on the way  I realized I needed to find a space of my own. There was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard  and without any previous building experience  and about       dollars and some recycled materials  I built this space. It had everything I needed. It was quiet. There was enough space. And I had control  which was very important. As I was building this space  I thought to myself   Surely I'm not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own.  So I did some research. And I found that there was an historic precedence. Hemingway had his writing space. Elvis had two or three manspaces  which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland. In the popular culture  Superman had the Fortress of Solitude  and there was  of course  the Batcave. So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now. Here is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin  Texas  which is where I'm from. On the outside it looks like a very typical garage  a nice garage. But on the inside  it's anything but. And this  to me  is a pretty classic manspace. It has neon concert posters  a bar and  of course  the leg lamp  which is very important. I soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside. This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard  out of landscaping timbers  astroturf. And he found the scoreboard in the trash. Here's another outdoor space  a little bit more sophisticated. This a      wooden tugboat  made completely out of Douglas fir. The guy did it all himself. And there is about       square feet of hanging out space inside. So  pretty early on in my investigations I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find  which was  quite frankly  a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat screen TVs. There were definitely hang out spots. But some were for working  some were for playing  some were for guys to collect their things. Most of all  I was just surprised with what I was finding. Take this place for example. On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage. This is in Long Island  New York. The only thing that might tip you off is the round window. On the inside it's a recreation of a   th century Japanese tea house. The man imported all the materials from Japan  and he hired a Japanese carpenter to build it in the traditional style. It has no nails or screws. All the joints are hand carved and hand scribed. Here is another pretty typical scene. This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood. But you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional size boxing ring inside. And so there is a good reason for this. It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough. He won the silver medal for Ireland in the      Olympics  and he trains in this space. He trains other people. And right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments  which is another sort of important part about a manspace. So  while this space represents someone's profession  this one certainly represents a passion. It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship. It's a collection of nautical antiques from the     s and     s. Museum quality. So  as I came to the end of my journey  I found over    spaces. And they were unexpected and they were surprising. But they were also    I was really impressed by how personalized they were  and how much work went into them. And I realized that's because the guys that I met were all very passionate about what they did. And they really loved their professions. And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies. And so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do  and who they were. So if you don't have a space of your own  I highly recommend finding one  and getting into it. Thank you very much. The substance of things unseen. Cities  past and future. In Oxford  perhaps we can use Lewis Carroll and look in the looking glass that is New York City to try and see our true selves  or perhaps pass through to another world. Or  in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald   As the moon rose higher  the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that once flowered for Dutch sailors' eyes  a fresh green breast of the new world.  My colleagues and I have been working for    years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call The Mannahatta Project. We're trying to discover what Henry Hudson would have seen on the afternoon of September   th        when he sailed into New York harbor. And I'd like to tell you the story in three acts  and if I have time still  an epilogue. So  Act I  A Map Found. So  I didn't grow up in New York. I grew up out west in the Sierra Nevada Mountains  like you see here  in the Red Rock Canyon. And from these early experiences as a child I learned to love landscapes. And so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies  I studied this emerging field of landscape ecology. Landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals. This experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the Wildlife Conservation Society  which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world. And over the last decade  I traveled to over    countries to see jaguars and bears and elephants and tigers and rhinos. But every time I would return from my trips I'd return back to New York City. And on my weekends I would go up  just like all the other tourists  to the top of the Empire State Building  and I'd look down on this landscape  on these ecosystems  and I'd wonder   How does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals  How does it work to make habitat for animals like me   I'd go to Times Square and I'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall  and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them. I'd go to Central Park and see the rolling topography of Central Park come up against the abrupt and sheer topography of midtown Manhattan. I started reading about the history and the geography in New York City. I read that New York City was the first mega city  a city of    million people or more  in     . I started seeing paintings like this. For those of you who are from New York  this is    th street under the West Side Highway. It was once a beach. And this painting has John James Audubon  the painter  sitting on the rock. And it's looking up on the wooded heights of Washington Heights to Jeffrey's Hook  where the George Washington Bridge goes across today. Or this painting  from the     s  from Greenwich Village. Those are two students at King's College    later Columbia University    sitting on a hill  overlooking a valley. And so I'd go down to Greenwich Village and I'd look for this hill  and I couldn't find it. And I couldn't find that palm tree. What's that palm tree doing there  So  it was in the course of these investigations that I ran into a map. And it's this map you see here. It's held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in. This map isn't from Hudson's time  but from the American Revolution      years later  made by British military cartographers during the occupation of New York City. And it's a remarkable map. It's in the National Archives here in Kew. And it's    feet long and three and a half feet wide. And if I zoom in to lower Manhattan you can see the extent of New York City as it was  right at the end of the American Revolution. Here's Bowling Green. And here's Broadway. And this is City Hall Park. So the city basically extended to City Hall Park. And just beyond it you can see features that have vanished  things that have disappeared. This is the Collect Pond  which was the fresh water source for New York City for its first     years  and for the Native Americans for thousands of years before that. You can see the Lispenard Meadows draining down through here  through what is TriBeCa now  and the beaches that come up from the Battery  all the way to   nd St. This map was made for military reasons. They're mapping the roads  the buildings  these fortifications that they built. But they're also mapping things of ecological interest  also military interest  the hills  the marshes  the streams. This is Richmond Hill  and Minetta Water  which used to run its way through Greenwich Village. Or the swamp at Gramercy Park  right here. Or Murray Hill. And this is the Murrays' house on Murray Hill      years ago. Here is Times Square  the two streams that came together to make a wetland in Times Square  as it was at the end of the American Revolution. So I saw this remarkable map in a book. And I thought to myself   You know  if I could georeference this map  if I could place this map in the grid of the city today  I could find these lost features of the city  in the block by block geography that people know  the geography of where people go to work  and where they go to live  and where they like to eat.  So  after some work we were able to georeference it  which allows us to put the modern streets on the city  and the buildings  and the open spaces  so that we can zoom in to where the Collect Pond is. We can digitize the Collect Pond and the streams  and see where they actually are in the geography of the city today. So this is fun for finding where things are relative to the old topography. But I had another idea about this map. If we take away the streets  and if we take away the buildings  and if we take away the open spaces  then we could take this map. If we pull off the   th century features we could drive it back in time. We could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals  to the hills  to the streams  to the basic hydrology and shoreline  to the beaches  the basic aspects that make the ecological landscape. Then  if we added maps like the geology  the bedrock geology  and the surface geology  what the glaciers leave  if we make the soil map  with the    soil classes  that are defined by the National Conservation Service  if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were  then we can calculate the slopes. We can calculate the aspect. We can calculate the winter wind exposure    so  which way the winter winds blow across the landscape. The white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds. We compiled all the information about where the Native Americans were  the Lenape. And we built a probability map of where they might have been. So  the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on Manhattan  places that are close to water  places that are near the harbor to fish  places protected from the winter winds. We know that there was a Lenape settlement down here by the Collect Pond. And we knew that they planted a kind of horticulture  that they grew these beautiful gardens of corn  beans  and squash  the  Three Sisters  garden. So  we built a model that explains where those fields might have been. And the old fields  the successional fields that go. And we might think of these as abandoned. But  in fact  they're grassland habitats for grassland birds and plants. And they have become successional shrub lands  and these then mix in to a map of all the ecological communities. And it turns out that Manhattan had    different ecosystem types. You can think of these as neighborhoods  as distinctive as TriBeCa and the Upper East Side and Inwood    that these are the forest and the wetlands and the marine communities  the beaches. And    is a lot. On a per area basis  Manhattan had more ecological communities per acre than Yosemite does  than Yellowstone  than Amboseli. It was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity. So  Act II  A Home Reconstructed. So  we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees  the    different kinds of fish that were on Manhattan  the Heath hens  the species that aren't there anymore  the beavers on all the streams  the black bears  and the Native Americans  to study how they used and thought about their landscape. We wanted to try and map these. And to do that what we did was we mapped their habitat needs. Where do they get their food  Where do they get their water  Where do they get their shelter  Where do they get their reproductive resources  To an ecologist  the intersection of these is habitat  but to most people  the intersection of these is their home. So  we would read in field guides  the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves  you know  what beavers need is   A slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows  near the water.  That's the best thing for a beaver. So we just started making a list. Here is the beaver. And here is the stream  and the aspen and the alder and the willow. As if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver. Or the bog turtle  needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places. Or the bobcat  needing rabbits and beavers and den sites. And rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be something that a bobcat needs. But a beaver also needs things. And that having it on either side means that we can link it together  that we can create the network of the habitat relationships for these species. Moreover  we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist  but you can look up what an aspen needs. An aspen needs fire and dry soils. And you can look at what a wet meadow needs. And it need beavers to create the wetlands  and maybe some other things. But you can also talk about sunny places. So  what does a sunny place need  Not habitat per se. But what are the conditions that make it possible  Or fire. Or dry soils. And that you can put these on a grid that's       columns long across the top and       rows down the other way. And then we can visualize this data like a network  like a social network. And this is the network of all the habitat relationships of all the plants and animals on Manhattan  and everything they needed  going back to the geology  going back to time and space at the very core of the web. We call this the Muir Web. And if you zoom in on it it looks like this. Each point is a different species or a different stream or a different soil type. And those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together. They are the connections that actually make nature resilient. And the structure of this is what makes nature work  seen with all its parts. We call these Muir Webs after the Scottish American naturalist John Muir  who said   When we try to pick out anything by itself  we find that it's bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken  to everything in the universe.  So then we took the Muir webs and we took them back to the maps. So if we wanted to go between   th and   th  and Lex and Third  maybe there was a stream in that block. And these would be the kind of trees that might have been there  and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses  the butterflies  the fish in the stream  the birds in the trees. Maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there. And perhaps a black bear walked by. And maybe Native Americans were there. And then we took this data. You can see this for yourself on our website. You can zoom into any block on Manhattan  and see what might have been there     years ago. And we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in Act III. We used the tools they use in Hollywood to make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies. And we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue. So we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography. We'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters  and illuminate the landscape. We would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities. And feed into that the map of the species. So that we would actually take a photograph  flying above Times Square  looking toward the Hudson River  waiting for Hudson to come. Using this technology  we can make these fantastic georeferenced views. We can basically take a picture out of any window on Manhattan and see what that landscape looked like     years ago. This is the view from the East River  looking up Murray Hill at where the United Nations is today. This is the view looking down the Hudson River  with Manhattan on the left  and New Jersey out on the right  looking out toward the Atlantic Ocean. This is the view over Times Square  with the beaver pond there  looking out toward the east. So we can see the Collect Pond  and Lispenard Marshes back behind. We can see the fields that the Native Americans made. And we can see this in the geography of the city today. So when you're watching  Law and Order   and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the New York Court House  right into the Collect Pond      years ago. So these images are the work of my friend and colleague  Mark Boyer  who is here in the audience today. And I'd just like  if you would give him a hand  to call out for his fine work. There is such power in bringing science and visualization together  that we can create images like this  perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass. And even though I've only had a brief time to speak  I hope you appreciate that Mannahatta was a very special place. The place that you see here on the left side was interconnected. It was based on this diversity. It had this resilience that is what we need in our modern world. But I wouldn't have you think that I don't like the place on the right  which I quite do. I've come to love the city and its kind of diversity  and its resilience  and its dependence on density and how we're connected together. In fact  that I see them as reflections of each other  much as Lewis Carroll did in  Through the Looking Glass.  We can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time  that they really are the same place  that there is no way that cities can escape from nature. And I think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future. So if you'll allow me a brief epilogue  not about the past  but about     years from now  what we're realizing is that cities are habitats for people  and need to supply what people need  a sense of home  food  water  shelter  reproductive resources  and a sense of meaning. This is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity. And so many of the talks here at TED are about meaning  about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways  through technology  through art  through science  so much so that I think we focus so much on that side of our lives  that we haven't given enough attention to the food and the water and the shelter  and what we need to raise the kids. So  how can we envision the city of the future  Well  what if we go to Madison Square Park  and we imagine it without all the cars  and bicycles instead and large forests  and streams instead of sewers and storm drains  What if we imagined the Upper East Side with green roofs  and streams winding through the city  and windmills supplying the power we need  Or if we imagine the New York City metropolitan area  currently home to    million people  but    million people in the future  perhaps living at the density of Manhattan  in only    percent of the area  with the areas in between covered by farmland  covered by wetlands  covered by the marshes we need. This is the kind of future I think we need  is a future that has the same diversity and abundance and dynamism of Manhattan  but that learns from the sustainability of the past  of the ecology  the original ecology  of nature with all its parts. Thank you very much. I'm Dr. David Hanson  and I build robots with character. And by that  I mean that I develop robots that are characters  but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you. So we're starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces  make eye contact with you  make a full range of facial expressions  understand speech and begin to model how you're feeling and who you are  and build a relationship with you. I developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved  on lower power  which enabled the walking biped robots  the first androids. So  it's a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face  running on very small batteries  extremely lightweight. The materials that allowed the battery operated facial expressions is a material that we call Frubber  and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen. One is hierarchical pores  and the other is a macro molecular nanoscale porosity in the material. There he's starting to walk. This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. I built the head. They built the body. So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines  and not just sentience  but empathy. We're working with the Machine Perception Laboratory at the U.C. San Diego. They have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions  what facial expressions you're making. It also recognizes where you're looking  your head orientation. We're emulating all the major facial expressions  and then controlling it with the software that we call the Character Engine. And here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that. In fact  right now    plug it from here  and then plug it in here  and now let's see if it gets my facial expressions. Okay. So I'm smiling. Now I'm frowning. And this is really heavily backlit. Okay  here we go. Oh  it's so sad. Okay  so you smile  frowning. So his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic. Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing. Right  Those machines have no place for empathy. And there is billions of dollars being spent on that. Character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy. So  if they achieve human level intelligence or  quite possibly  greater than human levels of intelligence  this could be the seeds of hope for our future. So  we've made    robots in the last eight years  during the course of getting my Ph.D. And then I started Hanson Robotics  which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing. This is one of our robots that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago. And it sees multiple people in a scene  remembers where individual people are  and looks from person to person  remembering people. So  we're involving two things. One  the perception of people  and two  the natural interface  the natural form of the interface  so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot. You start to believe that it's alive and aware. So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together in an artistic display of an android portrait of science fiction writer Philip K. Dick  who wrote great works like   Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep   which was the basis of the movie  Bladerunner.  In these stories  robots often think that they're human  and they sort of come to life. So we put his writings  letters  his interviews  correspondences  into a huge database of thousands of pages  and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him. And it was kind of spooky  because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you. And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing  which is a little character that's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence  friendly machine intelligence. And we're getting this mass manufactured. We specked it out to actually be doable with a very  very low cost bill of materials  so that it can become a childhood companion for kids. Interfacing with the Internet  it gets smarter over the years. As artificial intelligence evolves  so does his intelligence. Chris Anderson  Thank you so much. That's incredible. This is my first time at TED. Normally  as an advertising man  I actually speak at TED Evil  which is TED's secret sister that pays all the bills. It's held every two years in Burma. And I particularly remember a really good speech by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again. But  actually  it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business  that what we create in advertising  which is intangible value    you might call it perceived value  you might call it badge value  subjective value  intangible value of some kind    gets rather a bad rap. If you think about it  if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods  you basically have two choices. You can either live in a world which is poorer  which people in general don't like. Or you can live in a world where actually intangible value constitutes a greater part of overall value  that actually intangible value  in many ways is a very  very fine substitute for using up labor or limited resources in the creation of things. Here is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris. The question was given to a bunch of engineers  about    years ago   How do we make the journey to Paris better   And they came up with a very good engineering solution  which was to spend six billion pounds building completely new tracks from London to the coast  and knocking about    minutes off a three and half hour journey time. Now  call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ... ... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter. Now what is the hedonic opportunity cost on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks  Here is my naive advertising man's suggestion. What you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels  pay them to walk the length of the train  handing out free Chateau Petrus for the entire duration of the journey. Now  you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change  and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down. Now  here is another naive advertising man's question again. And this shows that engineers  medical people  scientific people  have an obsession with solving the problems of reality  when actually most problems  once you reach a basic level of wealth in society  most problems are actually problems of perception. So I'll ask you another question. What on earth is wrong with placebos  They seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop. They work extraordinarily well. They have no side effects  or if they do  they're imaginary  so you can safely ignore them. So I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog by Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it. Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further  and actually produce placebo education. The point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things. It actually works by giving you the impression that you've had a very good education  which gives you an insane sense of unwarranted self confidence  which then makes you very  very successful in later life. So  welcome to Oxford  ladies and gentlemen. But  actually  the point of placebo education is interesting. How many problems of life can be solved actually by tinkering with perception  rather than that tedious  hardworking and messy business of actually trying to change reality  Here's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings  but doing a bit of historical research  it seems to be Fredrick the Great. Fredrick the Great of Prussia was very  very keen for the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it  because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate  wheat and potatoes  you get less price volatility in bread. And you get a far lower risk of famine  because you actually had two crops to fall back on  not one. The only problem is  potatoes  if you think about it  look pretty disgusting. And also    th century Prussians ate very  very few vegetables    rather like contemporary Scottish people. So  actually  he tried making it compulsory. The Prussian peasantry said   We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things. They are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing.  There are even records of people being executed for refusing to grow potatoes. So he tried plan B. He tried the marketing solution  which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable  and none but the royal family could consume it. And he planted it in a royal potato patch  with guards who had instructions to guard over it  night and day  but with secret instructions not to guard it very well. Now    th century peasants know that there is one pretty safe rule in life  which is if something is worth guarding  it's worth stealing. Before long  there was a massive underground potato growing operation in Germany. What he'd effectively done is he'd re branded the potato. It was an absolute masterpiece. I told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said   Very  very good marketer  Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk.  Ataturk  rather like Nicolas Sarkozy  was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil  in Turkey  to modernize it. Now  boring people would have just simply banned the veil. But that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback and a hell of a lot of resistance. Ataturk was a lateral thinker. He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil. I can't verify that fully  but it does not matter. There is your environmental problem solved  by the way  guys  All convicted child molesters have to drive a Porsche Cayenne. What Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things. Which is that  actually  first one  all value is actually relative. All value is perceived value. For those of you who don't speak Spanish  jugo de naranja    it's actually the Spanish for  orange juice.  Because actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso in Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors decided to practice price discrimination to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists. As an advertising man  I have to admire that. But the first thing is that all value is subjective. Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion. These funny signs that flash your speed at you  some of the new ones  on the bottom right  now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face  to act as an emotional trigger. What's fascinating about these signs is they cost about    percent of the running cost of a conventional speed camera  but they prevent twice as many accidents. So  the bizarre thing  which is baffling to conventional  classically trained economists  is that a weird little smiley face has a better effect on changing your behavior than the threat of a     fine and three penalty points. Tiny little behavioral economics detail  in Italy  penalty points go backwards. You start with    and they take them away. Because they found that loss aversion is a more powerful influence on people's behavior. In Britain we tend to feel   Whoa  Got another three   Not so in Italy. Another fantastic case of creating intangible value to replace actual or material value  which remember  is what  after all  the environmental movement needs to be about  This again is from Prussia  from  I think  about           . The wealthy Prussians  to help in the war against the French  were encouraged to give in all their jewelry. And it was replaced with replica jewelry made of cast iron. Here's one   Gold gab ich f r Eisen      .  The interesting thing is that for    years hence  the highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia wasn't made of gold or diamonds. It was made of cast iron. Because actually  never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry. This actually had symbolic value  badge value. It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past. So  the modern equivalent would of course be this. But  actually  there is a thing  just as there are Veblen goods  where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare    there are opposite kind of things where actually the value in them depends on them being ubiquitous  classless and minimalistic. If you think about it  Shakerism was a proto environmental movement. Adam Smith talks about   th century America  where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great  it was almost a block in the economy in New England  because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors. It's perfectly possible to create these social pressures which lead to more egalitarian societies. What's also interesting  if you look at products that have a high component of what you might call messaging value  a high component of intangible value  versus their intrinsic value  They are often quite egalitarian. In terms of dress  denim is perhaps the perfect example of something which replaces material value with symbolic value. Coca Cola. A bunch of you may be a load of pinkos  and you may not like the Coca Cola company  but it's worth remembering Andy Warhol's point about Coke. What Warhol said about Coke is  he said   What I really like about Coca Cola is the president of the United States can't get a better Coke than the bum on the corner of the street.  Now  that is  actually  when you think about it    we take it for granted    it's actually a remarkable achievement  to produce something that's that democratic. Now  we basically have to change our views slightly. There is a basic view that real value involves making things  involves labor. It involves engineering. It involves limited raw materials. And that what we add on top is kind of false. It's a fake version. And there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it. It patently veers toward propaganda. However  what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value  and it's much fairer. When I grew up  this was basically the media environment of my childhood as translated into food. You had a monopoly supplier. On the left  you have Rupert Murdoch  or the BBC. And on your right you have a dependent public which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it. Nowadays  the user is actually involved. This is actually what's called  in the digital world   user generated content.  Although it's called agriculture in the world of food. This is actually called a mash up  where you take content that someone else has produced and you do something new with it. In the world of food we call it cooking. This is food  .   which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people. This is mobile food. British are very good at that. Fish and chips in newspaper  the Cornish Pasty  the pie  the sandwich. We invented the whole lot of them. We're not very good at food in general. Italians do great food  but it's not very portable  generally. I only learned this the other day. The Earl of Sandwich didn't invent the sandwich. He actually invented the toasty. But then  the Earl of Toasty would be a ridiculous name. Finally  we have contextual communication. Now  the reason I show you Pernod    it's only one example. Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod. It tastes great within the borders of that country  but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else. Unicum in Hungary  for example. The Greeks have actually managed to produce something called Retsina  which even tastes shite when you're in Greece. But so much communication now is contextual that the capacity for actually nudging people  for giving them better information    B.J. Fogg  at the University of Stanford  makes the point that actually the mobile phone is    He's invented the phrase   persuasive technologies.  He believes the mobile phone  by being location specific  contextual  timely and immediate  is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented. Now  if we have all these tools at our disposal  we simply have to ask the question  and Thaler and Sunstein have  of how we can use these more intelligently. I'll give you one example. If you had a large red button of this kind  on the wall of your home  and every time you pressed it  it saved    dollars for you  put    dollars into your pension  you would save a lot more. The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines the behavior. Okay  Now  marketing has done a very  very good job of creating opportunities for impulse buying. Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving. If you did this  more people would save more. It's simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions  and the very nature of the decisions changes. Obviously  I don't want people to do this  because as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just consumerism needlessly postponed. But if anybody did want to do that  that's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about  actually  fundamental opportunities to change human behavior. Now  I've got an example here from Canada. There was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada called Hunter Somerville  who was working in improv in Toronto  and got a part time job in advertising  and was given the job of advertising Shreddies. Now this is the most perfect case of creating intangible  added value  without changing the product in the slightest. Shreddies is a strange  square  whole grain cereal  only available in New Zealand  Canada and Britain. It's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown. In working out how you could re launch Shreddies  he came up with this. Video   Buzzer  Man  Shreddies is supposed to be square. Woman  Have any of these diamond shapes gone out  Voiceover  New Diamond Shreddies cereal. Same     percent whole grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape. Rory Sutherland  I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect example of intangible value creation. All it requires is photons  neurons  and a great idea to create this thing. I would say it's a work of genius. But  naturally  you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research. Man  So  Shreddies is actually producing a new product  which is something very exciting for them. So they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies. So I just want to get your first impressions when you see that  when you see the Diamond Shreddies box there. Woman  Weren't they square  Woman     I'm a little bit confused. Woman     They look like the squares to me. Man  They    Yeah  it's all in the appearance. But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six  if you flip it over it looks like a nine. But a six is very different from a nine. Woman      Or an  M  and a  W . Man  An  M  and a  W   exactly. Man      unclear  You just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that it's more interesting looking. Man  Just try both of them. Take a square one there  first. Man  Which one did you prefer  Man     The first one. Man  The first one  Rory Sutherland  Now  naturally  a debate raged. There were conservative elements in Canada  unsurprisingly  who actually resented this intrusion. So  eventually  the manufacturers actually arrived at a compromise  which was the combo pack. If you think it's funny  bear in mind there is an organization called the American Institute of Wine Economics  which actually does extensive research into perception of things  and discovers that except for among perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people  there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment in wine  except when you tell the people how expensive it is  in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more. So drink your wine blind in the future. But this is both hysterically funny    but I think an important philosophical point  which is  going forward  we need more of this kind of value. We need to spend more time appreciating what already exists  and less time agonizing over what else we can do. Two quotations to more or less end with. One of them is   Poetry is when you make new things familiar and familiar things new.  Which isn't a bad definition of what our job is  to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar  but also to gain a greater appreciation  and place a far higher value on those things which are already existing. There is some evidence  by the way  that things like social networking help do that. Because they help people share news. They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities. So they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display  and increase the kind of third party enjoyment you can get from the smallest  simplest things in life. Which is magic. The second one is the second G.K. Chesterton quote of this session  which is   We are perishing for want of wonder  not for want of wonders   which I think for anybody involved in technology  is perfectly true. And a final thing  When you place a value on things like health  love  sex and other things  and learn to place a material value on what you've previously discounted for being merely intangible  a thing not seen  you realize you're much  much wealthier than you ever imagined. Thank you very much indeed. Our mission is to build a detailed  realistic computer model of the human brain. And we've done  in the past four years  a proof of concept on a small part of the rodent brain  and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up to reach the human brain. Why are we doing this  There are three important reasons. The first is  it's essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society  and I think that it is a key step in evolution. The second reason is  we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever  and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge into a working model. It's like a Noah's Ark. It's like an archive. And the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet that are affected by mental disorder  and the drugs that are used today are largely empirical. I think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders. Now  even at this stage  we can use the brain model to explore some fundamental questions about how the brain works. And here  at TED  for the first time  I'd like to share with you how we're addressing one theory    there are many theories    one theory of how the brain works. So  this theory is that the brain creates  builds  a version of the universe  and projects this version of the universe  like a bubble  all around us. Now  this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries. But  for the first time  we can actually address this  with brain simulation  and ask very systematic and rigorous questions  whether this theory could possibly be true. The reason why the moon is huge on the horizon is simply because our perceptual bubble does not stretch out         kilometers. It runs out of space. And so what we do is we compare the buildings within our perceptual bubble  and we make a decision. We make a decision it's that big  even though it's not that big. And what that illustrates is that decisions are the key things that support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive. Without decisions you cannot see  you cannot think  you cannot feel. And you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep  or by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain  but in fact most anesthetics don't work that way. What they do is they introduce a noise into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other. They are confused  and you cannot make a decision. So  while you're trying to make up your mind what the doctor  the surgeon  is doing while he's hacking away at your body  he's long gone. He's at home having tea. So  when you walk up to a door and you open it  what you compulsively have to do to perceive is to make decisions  thousands of decisions about the size of the room  the walls  the height  the objects in this room.    percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes. It is what you infer about that room. So I can say  with some certainty   I think  therefore I am.  But I cannot say   You think  therefore you are   because  you  are within my perceptual bubble. Now  we can speculate and philosophize this  but we don't actually have to for the next hundred years. We can ask a very concrete question.  Can the brain build such a perception   Is it capable of doing it  Does it have the substance to do it  And that's what I'm going to describe to you today. So  it took the universe    billion years to build the brain. It had to improve it a little bit. It had to add to the frontal part  so that you would have instincts  because they had to cope on land. But the real big step was the neocortex. It's a new brain. You needed it. The mammals needed it because they had to cope with parenthood  social interactions  complex cognitive functions. So  you can think of the neocortex actually as the ultimate solution today  of the universe as we know it. It's the pinnacle  it's the final product that the universe has produced. It was so successful in evolution that from mouse to man it expanded about a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons  to produce this almost frightening organ  structure. And it has not stopped its evolutionary path. In fact  the neocortex in the human brain is evolving at an enormous speed. If you zoom into the surface of the neocortex  you discover that it's made up of little modules  G  processors  like in a computer. But there are about a million of them. They were so successful in evolution that what we did was to duplicate them over and over and add more and more of them to the brain until we ran out of space in the skull. And the brain started to fold in on itself  and that's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted. We're just packing in columns  so that we'd have more neocortical columns to perform more complex functions. So you can think of the neocortex actually as a massive grand piano  a million key grand piano. Each of these neocortical columns would produce a note. You stimulate it  it produces a symphony. But it's not just a symphony of perception. It's a symphony of your universe  your reality. Now  of course it takes years to learn how to master a grand piano with a million keys. That's why you have to send your kids to good schools  hopefully eventually to Oxford. But it's not only education. It's also genetics. You may be born lucky  where you know how to master your neocortical column  and you can play a fantastic symphony. In fact  there is a new theory of autism called the  intense world  theory  which suggests that the neocortical columns are super columns. They are highly reactive  and they are super plastic  and so the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony which is unthinkable for us. But you can also understand that if you have a disease within one of these columns  the note is going to be off. The perception  the symphony that you create is going to be corrupted  and you will have symptoms of disease. So  the Holy Grail for neuroscience is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column    and it's not just for neuroscience  it's perhaps to understand perception  to understand reality  and perhaps to even also understand physical reality. So  what we did was  for the past    years  was to dissect out the neocortex  systematically. It's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest. How many trees does it have  What shapes are the trees  How many of each type of tree do you have  Where are they positioned  But it's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to describe and discover all the rules of communication  the rules of connectivity  because the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron. They choose very carefully who they connect with. It's also more than cataloging because you actually have to build three dimensional digital models of them. And we did that for tens of thousands of neurons  built digital models of all the different types of neurons we came across. And once you have that  you can actually begin to build the neocortical column. And here we're coiling them up. But as you do this  what you see is that the branches intersect actually in millions of locations  and at each of these intersections they can form a synapse. And a synapse is a chemical location where they communicate with each other. And these synapses together form the network or the circuit of the brain. Now  the circuit  you could also think of as the fabric of the brain. And when you think of the fabric of the brain  the structure  how is it built  What is the pattern of the carpet  You realize that this poses a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain  and especially to a theory that says that there is some reality that emerges out of this carpet  out of this particular carpet with a particular pattern. The reason is because the most important design secret of the brain is diversity. Every neuron is different. It's the same in the forest. Every pine tree is different. You may have many different types of trees  but every pine tree is different. And in the brain it's the same. So there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another  and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours. And your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned in exactly the same way. And you may have more or less neurons. So it's very unlikely that you got the same fabric  the same circuitry. So  how could we possibly create a reality that we can even understand each other  Well  we don't have to speculate. We can look at all    million synapses now. We can look at the fabric. And we can change neurons. We can use different neurons with different variations. We can position them in different places  orient them in different places. We can use less or more of them. And when we do that what we discovered is that the circuitry does change. But the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not. So  the fabric of the brain  even though your brain may be smaller  bigger  it may have different types of neurons  different morphologies of neurons  we actually do share the same fabric. And we think this is species specific  which means that that could explain why we can't communicate across species. So  let's switch it on. But to do it  what you have to do is you have to make this come alive. We make it come alive with equations  a lot of mathematics. And  in fact  the equations that make neurons into electrical generators were discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates. So  we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive. We also have the mathematics to describe how neurons collect information  and how they create a little lightning bolt to communicate with each other. And when they get to the synapse  what they do is they effectively  literally  shock the synapse. It's like electrical shock that releases the chemicals from these synapses. And we've got the mathematics to describe this process. So we can describe the communication between the neurons. There literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex. But what you do need is a very big computer. And in fact you need one laptop to do all the calculations just for one neuron. So you need        laptops. So where do you go  You go to IBM  and you get a supercomputer  because they know how to take        laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator. So now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer. We can load up all the neurons  each one on to its processor  and fire it up  and see what happens. Take the magic carpet for a ride. Here we activate it. And this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain when there is a stimulation. It's the first view. Now  when you look at that the first time  you think   My god. How is reality coming out of that   But  in fact  you can start  even though we haven't trained this neocortical column to create a specific reality. But we can ask   Where is the rose   We can ask   Where is it inside  if we stimulate it with a picture   Where is it inside the neocortex  Ultimately it's got to be there if we stimulated it with it. So  the way that we can look at that is to ignore the neurons  ignore the synapses  and look just at the raw electrical activity. Because that is what it's creating. It's creating electrical patterns. So when we did this  we indeed  for the first time  saw these ghost like structures  electrical objects appearing within the neocortical column. And it's these electrical objects that are holding all the information about whatever stimulated it. And then when we zoomed into this  it's like a veritable universe. So the next step is just to take these brain coordinates and to project them into perceptual space. And if you do that  you will be able to step inside the reality that is created by this machine  by this piece of the brain. So  in summary  I think that the universe may have    it's possible    evolved a brain to see itself  which may be a first step in becoming aware of itself. There is a lot more to do to test these theories  and to test any other theories. But I hope that you are at least partly convinced that it is not impossible to build a brain. We can do it within    years  and if we do succeed  we will send to TED  in    years  a hologram to talk to you. Thank you. Over the next five minutes  my intention is to transform your relationship with sound. Let me start with the observation that most of the sound around us is accidental  and much of it is unpleasant.  Traffic noise  We stand on street corners  shouting over noise like this  and pretending that it doesn't exist. Well  this habit of suppressing sound has meant that our relationship with sound has become largely unconscious. There are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time  and I'd like to raise them in your consciousness today. First is physiological.  Loud alarm clocks  Sorry about that. I've just given you a shot of cortisol  your fight flight hormone. Sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time  but also your breathing  your heart rate    which I just also did    and your brainwaves. It's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it. This is surf.  Ocean waves  It has the frequency of roughly    cycles per minute. Most people find that very soothing  and  interestingly     cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human. There is a deep resonance with being at rest. We also associate it with being stress free and on holiday. The second way in which sound affects you is psychological. Music is the most powerful form of sound that we know that affects our emotional state.  Albinoni's Adagio  This is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sad if I leave it on. Music is not the only kind of sound  however  which affects your emotions. Natural sound can do that too. Birdsong  for example  is a sound which most people find reassuring.  Birds chirping  There is a reason for that. Over hundreds of thousands of years we've learned that when the birds are singing  things are safe. It's when they stop you need to be worried. The third way in which sound affects you is cognitively. You can't understand two people talking at once   If you're listening to this version of   Try and listen to the other one.   You have to choose which me you're going to listen to.   We have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input  which is why noise like this     Office noise     is extremely damaging for productivity. If you have to work in an open plan office like this  your productivity is greatly reduced. And whatever number you're thinking of  it probably isn't as bad as this. You are one third as productive in open plan offices as in quiet rooms. And I have a tip for you. If you have to work in spaces like that  carry headphones with you  with a soothing sound like birdsong. Put them on and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be. The fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally. With all that other stuff going on  it would be amazing if our behavior didn't change. at a steady    miles per hour  I don't think so. At the simplest  you move away from unpleasant sound and towards pleasant sounds. So if I were to play this     Jackhammer     for more than a few seconds  you'd feel uncomfortable  for more than a few minutes  you'd be leaving the room in droves. For people who can't get away from noise like that  it's extremely damaging for their health. And that's not the only thing that bad sound damages. Most retail sound is inappropriate and accidental  and even hostile  and it has a dramatic effect on sales. For those of you who are retailers  you may want to look away before I show this slide. They are losing up to    percent of their business with people leaving shops faster  or just turning around on the door. We all have done it  leaving the area because the sound in there is so dreadful. I want to spend just a moment talking about the model that we've developed  which allows us to start at the top and look at the drivers of sound  analyze the soundscape and then predict the four outcomes I've just talked about. Or start at the bottom  and say what outcomes do we want  and then design a soundscape to have a desired effect. At last we've got some science we can apply. And we're in the business of designing soundscapes. Just a word on music. Music is the most powerful sound there is  often inappropriately deployed. It's powerful for two reasons. You recognize it fast  and you associate it very powerfully. I'll give you two examples.  First chord of The Beatles'  A Hard Day's Night   Most of you recognize that immediately. The younger  maybe not.  Laughter  Now  those are one second samples of music. Music is very powerful. And unfortunately it's veneering commercial spaces  often inappropriately. I hope that's going to change over the next few years. Let me just talk about brands for a moment  because some of you run brands. Every brand is out there making sound right now. There are eight expressions of a brand in sound. They are all important. And every brand needs to have guidelines at the center. I'm glad to say that is starting to happen now. You all recognize that one.  Nokia ringtone  This is the most played tune in the world today.  .  billion times a day  that tune is played. And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing. Just leave you with four golden rules  for those of you who run businesses  for commercial sound. First  make it congruent  pointing in the same direction as your visual communication. That increases impact by over       percent. If your sound is pointing the opposite direction  incongruent  you reduce impact by    percent. That's an order of magnitude  up or down. This is important. Secondly  make it appropriate to the situation. Thirdly  make it valuable. Give people something with the sound. Don't just bombard them with stuff. And  finally  test and test it again. Sound is complex. There are many countervailing influences. It can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti  sometimes you just have to eat it and see what happens. So I hope this talk has raised sound in your consciousness. If you're listening consciously  you can take control of the sound around you. It's good for your health. It's good for your productivity. If we all do that we move to a state that I like to think will be sound living in the world. I'm going to leave you with a little bit more birdsong.  Birds chirping  I recommend at least five minutes a day  but there is no maximum dose. Thank you for lending me your ears today. Thirteen trillion dollars in wealth has evaporated over the course of the last two years. We've questioned the future of capitalism. We've questioned the financial industry. We've looked at our government oversight. We've questioned where we're going. And yet  at the same time  this very well may be a seminal moment in American history  an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in America. I'm calling this The Great Unwind. And the idea is a simple  simple idea  which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action. Consumers who represent    percent of the GDP of America have actually started  just like banks and just like businesses  to de leverage  to unwind their leverage  in daily life  to remove themselves from the liability and risk that presents itself as we move forward. So  to understand this    and I'm going to stress this    it's not about the consumer being in retreat. The consumer is empowered. In order to understand this  we're going to step back and look a little bit at what's happened over the course of the last year and a half. So  if you've been gone  this is the easy CliffsNotes on what's happened in the economy. Okay  Unemployment up. Housing values down. Equity markets down. Commodity prices are like this. If you're a mom trying to manage a budget  and oil was     dollars a barrel last summer  and it's somewhere between    and     do you plan vacations  How do you buy  What is your strategy in your household  Will the bailout work  We have national debt  Detroit  currency valuations  healthcare  all these issues facing us. You put them all together  you mix them up in a bouillabaisse  and you have consumer confidence that's basically a ticking time bomb. In fact  let's go back and look at what caused this crisis  because the consumer  all of us  in our daily lives  actually contributed a large part to the problem. This is something I call the       paradox. It took us    years to reach annual savings ratings of almost    percent.    years. Do you know what this was right here  This was World War II. Do you know why savings was so high  There was nothing to buy  unless you wanted to buy some rivets. Right  So  what happened though  over the course of the last    years    we went from a    percent savings rate to a negative savings rate. Because we binged. We bought extra large cars  supersized everything  we bought remedies for restless leg syndrome. All these things together basically created a factor where the consumer sort of drove us headlong into the crisis that we face today. The personal debt to income ratio basically went from    percent to     percent in the span of about    years. So consumers got overleveraged. And of course our banks did as well  as did our federal government. This is an absolutely staggering chart. It shows leverage  trended out from      to     . And what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education  future children in our households. So if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout  what you can see is if you stack up dollar bills  first of all          dollars is about the size of a five foot four guy. But if you stack it up  you just see this amazing  staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out. So this is the first     billion. But I read this fact the other day  that one trillion seconds equals    thousand years  so if you think about that  the context  the casualness with which we talk about trillion dollar bailout here  and trillion there  we are stacking ourselves up for long term leverage. However  consumers have moved. They are taking responsibility. What we're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate. In fact     straight months of savings have happened since the beginning of the crisis. We are working our way back up to that    percent. Also  remarkably  in the fourth quarter  spending dropped to its lowest level in    years  almost a  .  percent decline. Visa now reports that more people are using debit cards than they're using credit cards. So we're starting to pay for things with money that we have. And we're starting to be much more careful about how we save and how we invest. But that's not really the whole story. Because this has also been a dramatic time of transformation. And you've got to admit  over the course of the last year and a half  consumers have been doing some pretty weird things. It's been pretty staggering  what we've lived through. If you take into account    percent of all Americans were born after World War II  this is essentially our Depression. And so  as a result  some crazy things have happened. I'll give you some examples. Lets talk about dentists  vasectomies  guns and shark attacks. Okay  Dentists report molars  you know  people grinding their teeth  coming in and reporting the fact that they've had stress. And so there is an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced. Guns  gun sales  according to the FBI  who does background checks  are up almost    percent since January. Vasectomies are up    percent  according to the Cornell institute. And lastly  but a very good point  hopefully not related to the former point I just made  which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from     . Does anybody know why  No one is at the beach. So there is a bright side to everything. But seriously  what we see happening  and the reason I want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat  is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out. And what I mean by that is that we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption. Right  If you think about the last three decades  the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the '  s  to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade  but the one thing that has been holding them back is the ability to discriminate. By restricting their demand  consumers can actually align their values with their spending  and drive capitalism and business to not just be about more  but be about better. We're going to explain that right now. Based on Y R's BrandAsset Valuator  proprietary tool of VML and Young   Rubicam  we set out to understand what's been happening in the crisis with the consumer marketplace. We found a couple of really interesting things. We're going to go through four value shifts that we see driving new consumer behaviors  that offer new management principles. The first cultural value shift that we see is this tendency toward something we call liquid life. This is the movement from Americans defining their success on having things to having liquidity  because the less excess that you have around you  the more nimble and fleet of foot you are. As a result  d class  consumption is in. D class  consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously makes you look a little bit anti fashion. The management principle is dollars and cents. So let's look at some examples of this d class  consumption that falls out of this value. First things is we see something must be happening when P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling. But seriously  we also have this phenomenon on Madison Avenue and in other places  where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary  sort of generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases. We see high end haggling in fashion today. High end haggling for luxury and real estate. We also see just a relaxing of ego  and sort of a dismantling of artifice. This is a story on the yacht club that's all basically blue collar. Blue collar yacht club  where you can join the yacht club  but you've got to work in the boat yard  as sort of condition of membership. We also see the trend toward tourism that's a little bit more low key. Right  Agritourism  going to vineyards and going to farms. And then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents. What businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets is really interesting. A couple things that are kind of cool. One is that Frito Lay figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer. They found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month  less at the end of the month. So what they did is they started to change their packaging. Larger packs at the beginning of the month  smaller packaging at the end of the month. Really interestingly  too  was the San Francisco Giants. They've just instituted dynamic pricing. So it takes into account everything from the pitcher match ups  to the weather  to the team records  in setting prices for the consumer. Another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of Zynga. Zynga has risen on the consumer's desire to not want to be locked in to fixed cost. Again  this theme is about variable cost  variable living. So micropayments have become huge. And lastly  some people are using Hulu actually as a device to get rid of their cable bill. So  really clever ideas there that are kind of being taken ahold and marketers are starting to understand. The second of the four values is this movement toward ethics and fair play. We see that play itself out with empathy and respect. The consumer is demanding it. And  as a result  businesses must provide not only value  but values. Increasingly  consumers are looking at the culture of the company  looking for their conduct in the marketplace. So  what we see with empathy and respect  lots of really hopeful things that have come out of this recession. And I'll give you a few examples. One is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods  and increased emphasis on your neighbors as your support system. Also a wonderful byproduct of sort of a really lousy thing  which has been unemployment  is a rise in volunteerism that's been noted in our country. We also see the phenomenon    some of you may have  boomerang kids     these are  boomerang alumni   where universities are actually reconnecting with alumni in helping them with jobs  sharing skills and retraining. We also talked about character and professionalism. We had this miracle on the Hudson in New York City  you know  in January  and suddenly Sully has become a key name on Babycenter. So  from a value and values standpoint  what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways. Microsoft is doing something wonderful. They are actually vowing to retrain two million Americans with I.T. training  using their existing infrastructure to do something good. Also a really interesting company is Gore Tex. Gore Tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees  to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses. But they also talk about the fact that their executives  all of their expense reports are put onto their company intranet for everyone to see. Complete transparency. Think twice before you have that bottle of wine. The third of the four laws of post crisis consumerism is about durable living. We're seeing on our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon  not a sprint. They are digging in. And they're looking for ways to extract value out of every purchase that they make. Witness the fact that Americans are holding on to their cars longer than ever before   .  years on average  in March. A record. We also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for America. Did you know that    percent of Americans now carry a library card  The highest percentage ever in our nation's history. So what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge. Continuing education is up. Everything is focused on betterment  and training  and development and moving forward. We also see a big DIY movement. I was fascinated to learn that    percent of all homes in America are actually built by owners. That includes cottages and the like. But    percent. So  people are getting their hands dirty. They are rolling up their sleeves. They want these skills. We see that with the phenomenon of raising backyard hens and chickens and ducks. And when you work out the math  they say it doesn't work  but the principle is there that it's about being sustainable and taking care of yourself. And then we look at the High Line in New York City  an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure for something good  which is a brand new park in New York City. So  what brands can do  and companies  is pay dividends to consumers  be a brand that lasts  offer transparency  promise you're going to be there beyond today's sale. Perfect example of that is Patagonia. Patagonia's Footprint Chronicles basically goes through and tracks every product that they make  and gives you social responsibility  and helps you understand the ethics that are behind the product that they make. Another great example is Fidelity. Rather than instant cash back rewards on your credit or debit purchases  this is about     rewards for your student education. Or the interesting company SunRun. I love this company. They've created a consumer collective where they put solar panels on households and create a consumer based utility  where the electricity that they generate is basically pumped back out into the marketplace. So  it's a consumer driven co op. So  the fourth sort of post crisis consumerism that we see is this movement about return to the fold. It's incredibly important right now. Trust is not parceled out  as we all know. It's now about connecting to your communities  connecting to your social networks. In my book I talked about the fact that    percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company  versus    percent on advertising. So  in that respect  cooperative consumerism has really taken off. This is about consumers working together to get what they want out of the marketplace. Let's look at a couple of quick examples. The artisanal movement is huge. Everything about locally derived products and services  supporting your local neighborhoods  whether it's cheeses  wines and other products. Also this rise of local currencies. Realizing that it's difficult to get loans in this environment  you're doing business with people you trust  in your local markets. So  this rise of this sort of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon. And then they did a recent report I thought was fascinating. They actually started  in certain communities in the United States  start to publish people's electricity usage. And what they found out is when that was available for public record  the people's electricity usage in those communities dropped. Then we also look at the idea of cow pooling  which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic farms that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled. And then there is this other really interesting movement that's happened in California  which is about carrot mobs. The traditional thing would be to boycott right  Have a stick  Well why not have a carrot  So these are consumers organizing  pooling their resources to incentify companies to do good. And then we look at what companies can do. This is all the opportunity about being a community organizer. You have to realize that you can't fight and control this. You actually need to organize it. You need to harness it. You need to give it meaning. And there is lots of really interesting examples here that we see. First is just the rise of the fact that Zagat's has actually moved out of and diversified from rating restaurants  into actually rating healthcare. So what credentials does Zagat's have  Well  they have a lot  because it's their network of people. Right  So that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more elastic. Then you look at the phenomenon of Kogi. This Kogi doesn't exist. It's a moving truck. Right  It's a moving truck through L.A.  and the only way you can find it is through Twitter. Or you look at Johnson   Johnson's Momversations. A phenomenal blog that's been built up. Where J J basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers  allowing them to basically create a forum where they can communicate and they can connect. And it's also become a very  very valuable sort of advertising revenue for J J as well. This plus the fact that you've got phenomenal work from CEOs from Ford to Zappos  connecting on Twitter  creating an open environment  allowing their employees to be part of the process  rather than hidden behind walls. You see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt  all because the consumer is demanding it. So  when we look at this and we step back  what I believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real. It's been tremendously powerful for consumers. But  at the same time  this is also a tremendous opportunity. And the Chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin. Crisis equals opportunity. What we're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them to actually lead us forward out of this recession. So  we believe that values driven spending will force capitalism to be better. It will drive innovation. It will make longer lasting products. It will create better  more intuitive customer service. It will give us the opportunity to connect with companies that share the values that we share. So  when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we're seeing in our data  we see a very hopeful picture for the future of America. Thank you very much. One of the biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo real  digital human face. And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that  unlike aliens and dinosaurs  we look at human faces every day. They are very important to how we communicate with each other. As a result  we're tuned in to the subtlest things that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering  in order to believe whether these things are realistic. And what I'm going to do in the next five minutes is take you through a process where we tried to create a reasonably photo realistic computer generated face  using some computer graphics technology we've developed  and also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics. And we're going to try to do a photo real face of an actress named Emily O'Brien  who is right there. And that's actually a completely computer generated rendering of her face. By the end of the talk  we're going to see it move. The way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself  who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory in Marina Del Rey  and sit for a session in Light Stage  . This is a face scanning sphere  with     white LEDs all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions. And the lighting that we use these days looks something like this. We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds. And we basically capture enough information with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face  and different principle directions of light from the light stage  to figure out both the coarse scale and the fine scale detail of her face. If we zoom in on this photograph right here  we can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her  because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture. And in addition  we've actually used polarizers on all the lights    just like polarized sunglasses can block the glare off of the road  polarizers can block the shine off of the skin  so we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map. Now  if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit  we can actually bring that specular reflection of the skin back in  and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point. If you take the difference between these two images here  you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light of just the shine off of Emily's skin. I don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken before we had done this. And this is very important light to capture  because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin. It doesn't get underneath the translucent layers of the skin and blur out. And  as a result  it's a very good cue to the detailed shape of the skin pore structure and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have  the things that actually make us look like real humans. So  if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection  we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape  and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles. And  even more importantly  since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture  we can shoot Emily in just part of an afternoon  in many different facial poses and facial expressions. So  here you can see her moving her eyes around  moving her mouth around. And these we're actually going to use to create a photo real digital character. If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily  you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions. You can see things. Not only the face shape changes  but all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs. You can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously from stretched skin pores to the regular skin texture. You can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there. You can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down. Her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that. In addition to this kind of high resolution geometry  since it's all captured with cameras  we've got a great texture map to use for the face. And by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination  the red and the green and the blue  diffuse the light differently  we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer. Then  instead of looking like a plaster mannequin  it actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh. And this is what we used to give to the company Image Metrics to create a rigged  digital version of Emily. We're just seeing the coarse scale geometry here. But they basically created a digital puppet of her  where you can pull on these various strings  and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely consistent with the scans that we took. And  in addition to the coarse scale geometry  they also used all of that detail to create a set of what are called  displacement maps  that animate as well. These are the displacement maps here. And you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates. So the next process was then to animate her. We actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data. So  by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques  they were able to drive the facial rig with the computer generated performance. So what you're going to see now  after this  is a completely photo real digital face. We can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available. Emily  Image Metrics is a markerless  performance driven animation company. We specialize in high quality facial animation for video games and films. Image Metrics is a markerless  performance driven animation company. We specialize in high quality facial animation for video games and films. Paul Debevec  So  if we break that down into layers  here's that diffuse component we saw in the first slide. Here is the specular component animating. You can see all the wrinkles happening there. And there is the underlying wireframe mesh. And that is Emily herself. Now  where are we going with this here  We've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage  . This is Light Stage    and we're looking at taking this technology and applying it to whole human bodies. This is Bruce Lawmen  one of our researchers in the group  who graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage. And let's take a look at a computer generated version of Bruce  running in a new environment. And thank you very much. The magical moment  the magical moment of conducting. Which is  you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting. They are all  you know  warming up and doing stuff. And I go on the podium. You know  this little office of the conductor. Or rather a cubicle  an open space cubicle  with a lot of space. And in front of all that noise  you do a very small gesture. Something like this  not very pomp  not very sophisticated  this. And suddenly  out of the chaos  order. Noise becomes music. And this is fantastic. And it's so tempting to think that it's all about me. All those great people here  virtuosos  they make noise  they need me to do that. Not really. If it were that  I would just save you the talk  and teach you the gesture. So you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want  and you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work. Let's look at the first video. I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony. And then speak a little bit about how it comes about. Was that nice  So that was a sort of a success. Now  who should we thank for the success  I mean  obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully  the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. They don't often even look at the conductor. Then you have the clapping audience  yeah  actually taking part in doing the music. You know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music. This is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast that you will ever get in Vienna. Unlike  for example Israel  where audiences cough all the time. You know  Arthur Rubinstein  the pianist  used to say that   Anywhere in the world  people that have the flu  they go to the doctor. In Tel Aviv they come to my concerts.  So that's a sort of a tradition. But Viennese audiences do not do that. Here they go out of their regular  just to be part of that  to become part of the orchestra  and that's great. You know  audiences like you  yeah  make the event. But what about the conductor  What can you say the conductor was doing  actually  Um  he was happy. And I often show this to senior management. People get annoyed.  You come to work. How come you're so happy   Something must be wrong there  yeah  But he's spreading happiness. And I think the happiness  the important thing is this happiness does not come from only his own story and his joy of the music. The joy is about enabling other people's stories to be heard at the same time. You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body. You have the story of the audience as a community. Yeah. You have the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and in the audience. And then you have other stories  unseen. People who build this wonderful concert hall. People who made those Stradivarius  Amati  all those beautiful instruments. And all those stories are being heard at the same time. This is the true experience of a live concert. That's a reason to go out of home. Yeah  And not all conductors do just that. Let's see somebody else  a great conductor. Riccardo Muti  please. Yeah  that was very short  but you could see it's a completely different figure. Right  He's awesome. He's so commanding. Yeah  So clear. Maybe a little bit over clear. Can we have a little demonstration  Would you be my orchestra for a second  Can you sing  please  the first note of Don Giovanni  You have to sing  Aaaaaah   and I'll stop you. Okay  Ready  Audience    Aaaaaaah ...   Itay Talgam  Come on  with me. If you do it without me I feel even more redundant than I already feel. So please  wait for the conductor. Now look at me.  Aaaaaah   and I stop you. Let's go. Audience    ... Aaaaaaaah ...   Itay Talgam  So we'll have a little chat later. But ... There is a vacancy for a ... But     Laughter     you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger. Now what does Riccardo Muti do  He does something like this ... And then    sort of     Laughter  So not only the instruction is clear  but also the sanction  what will happen if you don't do what I tell you. So  does it work  Yes  it works    to a certain point. When Muti is asked   Why do you conduct like this   He says   I'm responsible.  Responsible in front of him. No he doesn't really mean Him. He means Mozart  which is     Laughter     like a third seat from the center. So he says   If I'm    if I'm responsible for Mozart  this is going to be the only story to be told. It's Mozart as I  Riccardo Muti  understand it.  And you know what happened to Muti  Three years ago he got a letter signed by all     employees of La Scala  musical employees  I mean the musicians  saying   You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign.   Why  Because you don't let us develop. You're using us as instruments  not as partners. And our joy of music  etc.  etc. ...  So he had to resign. Isn't that nice  He's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy. Well  can you do it with less control  or with a different kind of control  Let's look at the next conductor  Richard Strauss. I'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old. It's not true. When he was a young man of about     he wrote what he called  The Ten Commandments for Conductors.  The first one was  If you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong. That's the first one. The fourth one you'll like better. It says  Never look at the trombones    it only encourages them. So  the whole idea is really to let it happen by itself. Do not interfere. But how does it happen  Did you see him turning pages in the score  Now  either he is senile  and doesn't remember his own music  because he wrote the music. Or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them  saying   Come on guys. You have to play by the book. So it's not about my story. It's not about your story. It's only the execution of the written music  no interpretation.  Interpretation is the real story of the performer. So  no  he doesn't want that. That's a different kind of control. Let's see another super conductor  a German super conductor. Herbert von Karajan  please. What's different  Did you see the eyes  Closed. Did you see the hands  Did you see this kind of movement  Let me conduct you. Twice. Once like a Muti  and you'll     Claps     clap  just once. And then like Karajan. Let's see what happens. Okay  Like Muti. You ready  Because Muti ... Audience   Claps  Itay Talgam  Hmm ... again. Audience   Claps  Itay Talgam  Good. Now like a Karajan. Since you're already trained  let me concentrate  close my eyes. Come  come. Audience   Claps   Laughter  Itay Talgam  Why not together   Laughter  Because you didn't know when to play. Now I can tell you  even the Berlin Philharmonic doesn't know when to play. But I'll tell you how they do it. No cynicism. This is a German orchestra  yes  They look at Karajan. And then they look at each other.  Do you understand what this guy wants   And after doing that  they really look at each other  and the first players of the orchestra lead the whole ensemble in playing together. And when Karajan is asked about it he actually says   Yes  the worst damage I can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction. Because that would prevent the ensemble  the listening to each other that is needed for an orchestra.  Now that's great. What about the eyes  Why are the eyes closed  There is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London. And he cues in a flute player like this. The guy has no idea what to do.  Laughter   Maestro  with all due respect  when should I start   What do you think Karajan's reply was  When should I start  Oh yeah. He says   You start when you can't stand it anymore.  Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything. It's my music. The real music is only in Karajan's head. And you have to guess my mind. So you are under tremendous pressure because I don't give you instruction  and yet  you have to guess my mind. So it's a different kind of  a very spiritual but yet very firm control. Can we do it in another way  Of course we can. Let's go back to the first conductor we've seen  Carlos Kleiber  his name. Next video  please. Well  it is different. But isn't that controlling in the same way  No  it's not  because he is not telling them what to do. When he does this  it's not   Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix  smash it on the floor.  It's not that. He says   This is the gesture of the music. I'm opening a space for you to put in another layer of interpretation.  That is another story. But how does it really work together if it doesn't give them instructions  It's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah  You're not really given any instructions  but the forces of the process itself keep you in place. That's what he does. The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist. It's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads. And that's what makes them into partners. You have the plan in your head. You know what to do  even though Kleiber is not conducting you. But here and there and that. You know what to do. And you become a partner building the rollercoaster  yeah  with sound  as you actually take the ride. This is very exciting for those players. They do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks  later. It is very tiring. Yeah  But it's the best music making  like this. But of course it's not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy. You also have to be very professional. And look again at this Kleiber. Can we have the next video  quickly  You'll see what happens when there is a mistake. And now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done. Go along with the video. Look. See  second time for the same player.  Wait for me after the concert. I have a short notice to give you.  You know  when it's needed  the authority is there. It's very important. But authority is not enough to make people your partners. Let's see the next video  please. See what happens here. You might be surprised having seen Kleiber as such a hyperactive guy. He's conducting Mozart. The whole orchestra is playing. Now something else. See  He is there     percent  but not commanding  not telling what to do. Rather enjoying what the soloist is doing. Another solo now. See what you can pick up from this. Look at the eyes. Okay. You see that  First of all  it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get. It's not feedback. It's an  Mmmm ...  Yeah  it comes from here. So that's a good thing. And the second thing is it's about actually being in control  but in a very special way. When Kleiber does    did you see the eyes  going from here   Singing  You know what happens  Gravitation is no more. Kleiber not only creates a process  but also creates the conditions in the world in which this process takes place. So again  the oboe player is completely autonomous and therefore happy and proud of his work  and creative and all of that. And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level. So control is no longer a zero sum game. You have this control. You have this control. And all you put together  in partnership  brings about the best music. So Kleiber is about process. Kleiber is about conditions in the world. But you need to have process and content to create the meaning. Lenny Bernstein  my own personal maestro. Since he was a great teacher  Lenny Bernstein always started from the meaning. Look at this  please. Do you remember the face of Muti  at the beginning  Well he had a wonderful expression  but only one. Did you see Lenny's face  You know why  Because the meaning of the music is pain. And you're playing a painful sound. And you look at Lenny and he's suffering. But not in a way that you want to stop. It's suffering  like  enjoying himself in a Jewish way  as they say. But you can see the music on his face. You can see the baton left his hand. No more baton. Now it's about you  the player  telling the story. Now it's a reversed thing. You're telling the story. And you're telling the story. And even briefly  you become the storyteller to which the community  the whole community  listens to. And Bernstein enables that. Isn't that wonderful  Now  if you are doing all the things we talked about  together  and maybe some others  you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing. And for the last video  I think this is simply the best title. My friend Peter says   If you love something  give it away.  So  please. Twenty five and a quarter years ago I read a newspaper article which said that one day syringes would be one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS  the transmission of AIDS. I thought this was unacceptable. So I decided to do something about it. Sadly  it's come true. Malaria  as we all know  kills approximately one million people a year. The reuse of syringes now exceeds that and kills  .  million people a year. This young girl and her friend that I met in an orphanage in Delhi were HIV positive from a syringe. And what was so sad about this particular story was that once their parents had found out    and don't forget  their parents took them to the doctor    the parents threw them out on the street. And hence they ended up in an orphanage. And it comes from situations like this where you have either skilled or unskilled practitioners  blindly giving an injection to someone. And the injection is so valuable  that the people basically trust the doctor  being second to God  which I've heard many times  to do the right thing. But in fact they're not. And you can understand  obviously  the transmission problem between people in high virus areas. This video we took undercover  which shows you  over a half an hour period  a tray of medicines of    vials  which are being delivered with only   syringes in a public hospital in India. And over the course of half an hour  not one syringe was filmed being unwrapped. They started with two and they ended with two. And you'll see  just now  a nurse coming back to the tray  which is their sort of modular station  and dropping the syringe she's just used back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again. So you can imagine the scale of this problem. And in fact in India alone     percent of all injections given are unsafe. These kids in Pakistan don't go to school. They are lucky. They already have a job. And that job is that they go around and pick up syringes from the back of hospitals  wash them  and in the course of this  obviously picking them up they injure themselves. And then they repackage them and sell them out on markets for literally more money than a sterile syringe in the first place  which is quite bizarre. In an interesting photo  their father  while we were talking to him  picked up a syringe and pricked his finger    I don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end    and immediately whipped out a box of matches  lit one  and burned the blood off the end of his finger  giving me full assurance that that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV. In China  recycling is a major issue. And they are collected en mass    you can see the scale of it here    and sorted out  by hand  back into the right sizes  and then put back out on the street. So recycling and reuse are the major issues here. But there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia. In all schools in Indonesia  there is usually a toy seller in the playground. The toy seller  in this case  had syringes  which they usually do  next door to the diggers  which is obviously what you would expect. And they use them  in the breaks  for water pistols. They squirt them at each other  which is lovely and innocent. And they are having great fun. But they also drink from them while they're in their breaks  because it's hot. And they squirt the water into their mouths. And these are used with traces of blood visible. So we need a better product. And we need better information. And I think  if I can just borrow this camera  I was going to show you my invention  which I came up with. So  it's a normal looking syringe. You load it up in the normal way. This is made on existing equipment in    factories that we license. You give the injection and then put it down. If someone then tries to reuse it  it locks and breaks afterwards. It's very  very simple. Thank you. And it costs the same as a normal syringe. And in comparison  a Coca Cola is    times the price. And that will stop reusing a syringe    or    times. And I have an information charity which has done huge scale amount of work in India. And we're very proud of giving information to people  so that little kids like this don't do stupid things. Thank you very much. The future  as we know it  is very unpredictable. The best minds in the best institutions generally get it wrong. This is in technology. This is in the area of politics  where pundits  the CIA  MI  always get it wrong. And it's clearly in the area of finance. With institutions established to think about the future  the IMF  the BIS  the Financial Stability Forum  couldn't see what was coming. Over        economists whose job it is  competitive entry to get there  couldn't see what was happening. Globalization is getting more complex. And this change is getting more rapid. The future will be more unpredictable. Urbanization  integration  coming together  leads to a new renaissance. It did this a thousand years ago. The last    years have been extraordinary times. Life expectancy has gone up by about    years. It took from the Stone Age to achieve that. Income has gone up for a majority of the world's population  despite the population going up by about two billion people over this period. And illiteracy has gone down  from a half to about a quarter of the people on Earth. A huge opportunity  unleashing of new potential for innovation  for development. But there is an underbelly. There are two Achilles' heels of globalization. There is the Achilles' heel of growing inequality    those that are left out  those that feel angry  those that are not participating. Globalization has not been inclusive. The second Achilles' heel is complexity    a growing fragility  a growing brittleness. What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else. This is a systemic risk  systemic shock. We've seen it in the financial crisis. We've seen it in the pandemic flu. It will become virulent and it's something we have to build resilience against. A lot of this is driven by what's happening in technology. There have been huge leaps. There will be a million fold improvement in what you can get for the same price in computing by     . That's what the experience of the last    years has been. It will continue. Our computers  our systems will be as primitive as the Apollo's are for today. Our mobile phones are more powerful than the total Apollo space engine. Our mobile phones are more powerful than some of the strongest computers of    years ago. So what will this do  It will create huge opportunities in technology. Miniaturization as well. There will be invisible capacity. Invisible capacity in our bodies  in our brains  and in the air. This is a dust mite on a nanoreplica. This sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential  not least in the area of medicine. This is a stem cell that we've developed here in Oxford  from an embryonic stem cell. We can develop any part of the body. Increasingly  over time  this will be possible from our own skin    able to replicate parts of the body. Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine. I don't think there will be a Special Olympics long after       because of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body. But the question is   Who will have it   The other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics. The capacity to create  as this mouse has been genetically modified  something which goes three times faster  lasts for three times longer  we could produce  as this mouse can  to the age of our equivalent of    years  using about the same amount of food. But will this only be available for the super rich  for those that can afford it  Are we headed for a new eugenics  Will only those that are able to afford it be able to be this super race of the future  So the big question for us is   How do we manage this technological change   How do we ensure that it creates a more inclusive technology  a technology which means that not only as we grow older  that we can also grow wiser  and that we're able to support the populations of the future  One of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements will be moving from population pyramids to what we might term population coffins. There is unlikely to be a pension or a retirement age in     . These will be redundant concepts. And this isn't only something of the West. The most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new pyramids that will take place in China and in many other countries. So forget about retirements if you're young. Forget about pensions. Think about life and where it's going to be going. Of course  migration will become even more important. The war on talent  the need to attract people at all skill ranges  to push us around in our wheelchairs  but also to drive our economies. Our innovation will be vital. The employment in the rich countries will go down from about     to about     million of these people. This would imply a massive leap in migration. So the concerns  the xenophobic concerns of today  of migration  will be turned on their head  as we search for people to help us sort out our pensions and our economies in the future. And then  the systemic risks. We understand that these will become much more virulent  that what we see today is this interweaving of societies  of systems  fastened by technologies and hastened by just in time management systems. Small levels of stock push resilience into other people's responsibility. The collapse in biodiversity  climate change  pandemics  financial crises  these will be the currency that we will think about. And so a new awareness will have to arise  of how we deal with these  how we mobilize ourselves  in a new way  and come together as a community to manage systemic risk. It's going to require innovation. It's going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization could also be its downfall. This could be our best century ever because of the achievements  or it could be our worst. And of course we need to worry about the individuals  particularly the individuals that feel that they've been left out in one way or another. An individual  for the first time in the history of humanity  will have the capacity  by       to destroy the planet  to wreck everything  through the creation  for example  of a biopathogen. How do we begin to weave these tapestries together  How do we think about complex systems in new ways  That will be the challenge of the scholars  and of all of us engaged in thinking about the future. The rest of our lives will be in the future. We need to prepare for it now. We need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized. It cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring. We have to develop a new way of managing the planet  collectively  through collective wisdom. We know  and I know from my own experience  that amazing things can happen  when individuals and societies come together to change their future. I left South Africa  and    years later  after thinking I would never go back  I had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of Nelson Mandela. This was a miracle. We can create miracles  collectively  in our lifetime. It is vital that we do so. It is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in TED  that the ideas that we think about look forward  and make sure that this will be the most glorious century  and not one of eco disaster and eco collapse. Thank you.  Applause  I'm sure that  throughout the hundred thousand odd years of our species' existence  and even before  our ancestors looked up at the night sky  and wondered what stars are. Wondering  therefore  how to explain what they saw in terms of things unseen. Okay  so  most people only wondered that occasionally  like today  in breaks from whatever normally preoccupied them. But what normally preoccupied them also involved yearning to know. They wished they knew how to prevent their food supply from sometimes failing  and how they could rest when they were tired without risking starvation  be warmer  cooler  safer  in less pain. I bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know how to draw better. In every aspect of their lives  they wished for progress  just as we do. But they failed  almost completely  to make any. They didn't know how to. Discoveries like fire happened so rarely  that from an individual's point of view  the world never improved. Nothing new was learned. The first clue to the origin of starlight happened as recently as       radioactivity. Within    years  physicists discovered the whole explanation  expressed  as usual  in elegant symbols. But never mind the symbols. Think how many discoveries they represent. Nuclei and nuclear reactions  of course. But isotopes  particles of electricity  antimatter  neutrinos  the conversion of mass to energy    that's E mc      gamma rays  transmutation. That ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists was achieved through these same theories that explained starlight and other ancient mysteries  and new  unexpected phenomena. That all that  discovered in    years  had not been in the previous hundred thousand  was not for lack of thinking about stars  and all those other urgent problems they had. They even arrived at answers  such as myths  that dominated their lives  yet bore almost no resemblance to the truth. The tragedy of that protracted stagnation isn't sufficiently recognized  I think. These were people with brains of essentially the same design that eventually did discover all those things. But that ability to make progress remained almost unused  until the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe. Or so we should hope. Because that event was the Scientific Revolution  ever since which our knowledge of the physical world  and of how to adapt it to our wishes  has been growing relentlessly. Now  what had changed  What were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between stagnation and rapid  open ended discovery  How to make that difference is surely the most important universal truth that it is possible to know. Worryingly  there is no consensus about what it is. So  I'll tell you. But I'll have to backtrack a little first. Before the Scientific Revolution  they believed that everything important  knowable  was already known  enshrined in ancient writings  institutions  and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb    which were  however  entrenched as dogmas  along with many falsehoods. So they believed that knowledge came from authorities that actually knew very little. And therefore progress depended on learning how to reject the authority of learned men  priests  traditions and rulers. Which is why the Scientific Revolution had to have a wider context. The Enlightenment  a revolution in how people sought knowledge  trying not to rely on authority.  Take no one's word for it.  But that can't be what made the difference. Authorities had been rejected before  many times. And that rarely  if ever  caused anything like the Scientific Revolution. At the time  what they thought distinguished science was a radical idea about things unseen  known as empiricism. All knowledge derives from the senses. Well  we've seen that that can't be true. It did help by promoting observation and experiment. But  from the outset  it was obvious that there was something horribly wrong with it. Knowledge comes from the senses. In what language  Certainly not the language of mathematics  in which  Galileo rightly said  the book of nature is written. Look at the world. You don't see equations carved on to the mountainsides. If you did  it would be because people had carved them. By the way  why don't we do that  What's wrong with us  Empiricism is inadequate because  well  scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen. And the unseen  you have to admit  doesn't come to us through the senses. We don't see those nuclear reactions in stars. We don't see the origin of species. We don't see the curvature of space time  and other universes. But we know about those things. How  Well  the classic empiricist answer is induction. The unseen resembles the seen. But it doesn't. You know what the clinching evidence was that space time is curved  It was a photograph  not of space time  but of an eclipse  with a dot there rather than there. And the evidence for evolution  Some rocks and some finches. And parallel universes  Again  dots there  rather than there  on a screen. What we see  in all these cases  bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible    only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects them.  Ah   say creationists.  So you admit it's all interpretation. No one has ever seen evolution. We see rocks. You have your interpretation. We have ours. Yours comes from guesswork  ours from the Bible.  But what creationist and empiricists both ignore is that  in that sense  no one has ever seen a bible either  that the eye only detects light  which we don't perceive. Brains only detect nerve impulses. And they don't perceive even those as what they really are  namely electrical crackles. So we perceive nothing as what it really is. Our connection to reality is never just perception. It's always  as Karl Popper put it  theory laden. Scientific knowledge isn't derived from anything. It's like all knowledge. It's conjectural  guesswork  tested by observation  not derived from it. So  were testable conjectures the great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates  No. Contrary to what's usually said  testability is common  in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking. Any crank claiming the sun will go out next Tuesday has got a testable prediction. Consider the ancient Greek myth explaining seasons. Hades  God of the Underworld  kidnaps Persephone  the Goddess of Spring  and negotiates a forced marriage contract  requiring her to return regularly  and lets her go. And each year  she is magically compelled to return. And her mother  Demeter  Goddess of the Earth  is sad  and makes it cold and barren. That myth is testable. If winter is caused by Demeter's sadness  then it must happen everywhere on Earth simultaneously. So if the ancient Greeks had only known that Australia is at its warmest when Demeter is at her saddest  they'd have known that their theory is false. So what was wrong with that myth  and with all pre scientific thinking  and what  then  made that momentous difference  I think there is one thing you have to care about. And that implies testability  the scientific method  the Enlightenment  and everything. And here is the crucial thing. There is such a thing as a defect in a story. I don't just mean a logical defect. I mean a bad explanation. What does that mean  Well  explanation is an assertion about what's there  unseen  that accounts for what's seen. Because the explanatory role of Persephone's marriage contract could be played equally well by infinitely many other ad hoc entities. Why a marriage contract and not any other reason for regular annual action  Here is one. Persephone wasn't released. She escaped  and returns every spring to take revenge on Hades  with her Spring powers. She cools his domain with Spring air  venting heat up to the surface  creating summer. That accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth. It's equally testable. Yet what it asserts about reality is  in many ways  the opposite. And that is possible because the details of the original myth are unrelated to seasons  except via the myth itself. This easy variability is the sign of a bad explanation  because  without a functional reason to prefer one of countless variants  advocating one of them  in preference to the others  is irrational. So  for the essence of what makes the difference to enable progress  seek good explanations  the ones that can't be easily varied  while still explaining the phenomena. Now  our current explanation of seasons is that the Earth's axis is tilted like that  so each hemisphere tilts toward the sun for half the year  and away for the other half. Better put that up. That's a good explanation  hard to vary  because every detail plays a functional role. For instance  we know  independently of seasons  that surfaces tilted away from radiant heat are heated less  and that a spinning sphere  in space  points in a constant direction. And the tilt also explains the sun's angle of elevation at different times of year  and predicts that the seasons will be out of phase in the two hemispheres. If they'd been observed in phase  the theory would have been refuted. But now  the fact that it's also a good explanation  hard to vary  makes the crucial difference. If the ancient Greeks had found out about seasons in Australia  they could have easily varied their myth to predict that. For instance  when Demeter is upset  she banishes heat from her vicinity  into the other hemisphere  where it makes summer. So  being proved wrong by observation  and changing their theory accordingly  still wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks one jot closer to understanding seasons  because their explanation was bad  easy to vary. And it's only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it's testable. If the axis tilt theory had been refuted  its defenders would have had nowhere to go. No easily implemented change could make that tilt cause the same seasons in both hemispheres. The search for hard to vary explanations is the origin of all progress. It's the basic regulating principle of the Enlightenment. So  in science  two false approaches blight progress. One is well known  untestable theories. But the more important one is explanationless theories. Whenever you're told that some existing statistical trend will continue  but you aren't given a hard to vary account of what causes that trend  you're being told a wizard did it. When you are told that carrots have human rights because they share half our genes    but not how gene percentages confer rights    wizard. When someone announces that the nature nurture debate has been settled because there is evidence that a given percentage of our political opinions are genetically inherited  but they don't explain how genes cause opinions  they've settled nothing. They are saying that our opinions are caused by wizards  and presumably so are their own. That the truth consists of hard to vary assertions about reality is the most important fact about the physical world. It's a fact that is  itself  unseen  yet impossible to vary. Thank you. All buildings today have something in common. They're made using Victorian technologies. This involves blueprints  industrial manufacturing and construction using teams of workers. All of this effort results in an inert object. And that means that there is a one way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities. This is not sustainable. I believe that the only way that it is possible for us to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities is by connecting them to nature  not insulating them from it. Now  in order to do this  we need the right kind of language. Living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world  through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism. And this is the conversion of one group of substances into another  either through the production or the absorption of energy. And this is the way in which living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way. So  I'm interested in the use of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture. But they don't exist. So I'm having to make them. I'm working with architect Neil Spiller at the Bartlett School of Architecture  and we're collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach. That means we're generating them from scratch. One of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc  and he's really interested in the transition from inert to living matter. Now  that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in  when we're thinking about sustainable materials. So  Martin  he works with a system called the protocell. Now all this is    and it's magic    is a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it. And it has no DNA. This little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living. It is able to move around its environment. It can follow chemical gradients. It can undergo complex reactions  some of which are happily architectural. So here we are. These are protocells  patterning their environment. We don't know how they do that yet. Here  this is a protocell  and it's vigorously shedding this skin. Now  this looks like a chemical kind of birth. This is a violent process. Here  we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into carbonate. And that's the shell around that globular fat. They are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there. So what we're trying to do is  we're trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom up construction approaches for architecture  which contrast the current  Victorian  top down methods which impose structure upon matter. That can't be energetically sensible. So  bottom up materials actually exist today. They've been in use  in architecture  since ancient times. If you walk around the city of Oxford  where we are today  and have a look at the brickwork  which I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days  you'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone. And if you look even closer  you'll see  in that limestone  there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other. And then they are fossilized over millions of years. Now a block of limestone  in itself  isn't particularly that interesting. It looks beautiful. But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere. Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide. Would it give this block of limestone new properties  Well  most likely it would. It might be able to grow. It might be able to self repair  and even respond to dramatic changes in the immediate environment. So  architects are never happy with just one block of an interesting material. They think big. Okay  So when we think about scaling up metabolic materials  we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls  or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water. So  one of these examples would of course be the historic city of Venice. Now  Venice  as you know  has a tempestuous relationship with the sea  and is built upon wooden piles. So we've devised a way by which it may be possible for the protocell technology that we're working with to sustainably reclaim Venice. And architect Christian Kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city. So  here is the technology we have today. This is our protocell technology  effectively making a shell  like its limestone forefathers  and depositing it in a very complex environment  against natural materials. We're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this. Now  this is the very interesting part. We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals. What we need it to do is to be creatively crafted around the wooden piles. So  you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light  toward the dark foundations. We've observed this in the laboratory. The protocells can actually move away from the light. They can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species. So that these don't just exist as one entity  we kind of chemically engineer them. And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically  around the foundations of Venice  effectively petrifying it. Now  this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while. It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case by case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice. But gradually  as the buildings are repaired  we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city. An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide. Also it will attract the local marine ecology  who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture. So  this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way. But perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere. This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it  which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for First World countries. So  in summary  I'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to Victorian technologies  and building architectures from a bottom up approach. Secondly  these metabolic materials have some of the properties of living systems  which means they can perform in similar ways. They can expect to have a lot of forms and functions within the practice of architecture. And finally  an observer in the future marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one. Thank you. I'm a writer and a journalist  and I'm also an insanely curious person  so in    years as a journalist  I've learned how to do a lot of new things. And three years ago  one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible. I became one of the working homeless. I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February of that same year  and decided to travel. His death hit me pretty hard. And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that. I've camped my whole life. And I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip. So I packed my cat  my Rottweiler and my camping gear into a      Chevy van  and drove off into the sunset  having fully failed to realize three critical things. One  that society equates living in a permanent structure  even a shack  with having value as a person. Two  I failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality  if we let it. Three  I failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude  not a lifestyle. At first  living in the van was great. I showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly. And I had time to relax and to grieve. But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in. My freelance job ended. And I had to get a full time job to pay the bills. What had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer. And it became impossible to park anywhere       without being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me  and it was really hot. The cat came and went through an open window in the van. The doggy went into doggy day care. And I sweated. Whenever I could  I used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops. Or I washed up in public rest rooms. Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below    degrees Fahrenheit  making it difficult or impossible to sleep. Food rotted in the heat. Ice in my ice chest melted within hours  and it was pretty miserable. I couldn't afford to find an apartment  or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the Rottweiler and the cat. And I refused to give them up  so I stayed in the van. And when the heat made me too sick to walk the    feet to the public restroom outside my van at night  I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet. When winter weather set in  the temperatures dropped below freezing. And they stayed there. And I faced a whole new set of challenges. I parked a different place every night so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police. I didn't always succeed. But I felt out of control of my life. And I don't know when or how it happened  but the speed at which I went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman  living in a van  took my breath away. I hadn't changed. My I.Q. hadn't dropped. My talent  my integrity  my values  everything about me remained the same. But I had changed somehow. I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression. And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic. And I went. I hadn't bathed in three days. I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line. I just wasn't drunk or high. And when several of the homeless men realized that  including a former university professor  they said   You aren't homeless. Why are you really here   Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless  but I did. Then the professor listened to my story and he said   You have a job. You have hope. The real homeless don't have hope.  A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal. And I remember thinking   If I killed myself  no one would notice.  A friend told me  shortly after that  that she had heard that Tim Russert  a nationally renowned journalist  had been talking about me on national T.V. An essay I'd written about my father  the year before he died  was in Tim's new book. And he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing. And when I realized that Tim Russert  former moderator of  Meet the Press   was talking about my writing  while I was living in a van in a Wal Mart parking lot  I started laughing. You should too. I started laughing because it got to the point where  was I a writer  or was I a homeless woman  So I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book. And I stood there. And I reread my essay. And I cried. Because I was a writer. I was a writer. Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee. I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends. And I started writing again. By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist. I was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment. I was no longer homeless. And I was no longer invisible. Thousands of people work full and part time jobs  and live in their cars. But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets. So the homeless  the working homeless  primarily remain invisible. But if you ever meet one  engage them  encourage them  and offer them hope. The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope. And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless. I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet. But I am here to tell you that  based on my experience  people are not where they live  where they sleep  or what their life situation is at any given time. Three years ago I was living in a van in a Wal Mart parking lot  and today I'm speaking at TED. Hope always  always finds a way. Thank you. On the   th of May        a gunshot was heard ringing out across the   th arrondissement in Paris. A peasant  who was walking to market that morning  ran towards where the gunshot had come from  and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor  clearly shot by a dueling wound. The young man's name was Evariste Galois. He was a well known revolutionary in Paris at the time. Galois was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his brother. And the last words he said to his brother were   Don't cry for me  Alfred. I need all the courage I can muster to die at the age of   .  It wasn't  in fact  revolutionary politics for which Galois was famous. But a few years earlier  while still at school  he'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical problems at the time. And he wrote to the academicians in Paris  trying to explain his theory. But the academicians couldn't understand anything that he wrote. This is how he wrote most of his mathematics. So  the night before that duel  he realized this possibly is his last chance to try and explain his great breakthrough. So he stayed up the whole night  writing away  trying to explain his ideas. And as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny  he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation. Maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed. But contained inside those documents was a new language  a language to understand one of the most fundamental concepts of science    namely symmetry. Now  symmetry is almost nature's language. It helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world. For example  molecular structure. What crystals are possible  we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry. In microbiology you really don't want to get a symmetrical object  because they are generally rather nasty. The swine flu virus  at the moment  is a symmetrical object. And it uses the efficiency of symmetry to be able to propagate itself so well. But on a larger scale of biology  actually symmetry is very important  because it actually communicates genetic information. I've taken two pictures here and I've made them artificially symmetrical. And if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful  you're probably drawn to the lower two. Because it is hard to make symmetry. And if you can make yourself symmetrical  you're sending out a sign that you've got good genes  you've got a good upbringing and therefore you'll make a good mate. So symmetry is a language which can help to communicate genetic information. Symmetry can also help us to explain what's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN. Or what's not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN. To be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles we might see there  it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape in a higher dimensional space. And I think Galileo summed up  very nicely  the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us. He wrote   The universe cannot be read until we have learnt the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written. It is written in mathematical language  and the letters are triangles  circles and other geometric figures  without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word.  But it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry. Artists too love to play around with symmetry. They also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it. Here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in  The Magic Mountain.  He has a character describing the snowflake  and he says he  shuddered at its perfect precision  found it deathly  the very marrow of death.  But what artists like to do is to set up expectations of symmetry and then break them. And a beautiful example of this I found  actually  when I visited a colleague of mine in Japan  Professor Kurokawa. And he took me up to the temples in Nikko. And just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs. And the gateway you see behind has eight columns  with beautiful symmetrical designs on them. Seven of them are exactly the same  and the eighth one is turned upside down. And I said to Professor Kurokawa   Wow  the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down.  And he said   No  no  no. It was a very deliberate act.  And he referred me to this lovely quote from the Japanese  Essays in Idleness  from the   th century  in which the essayist wrote   In everything  uniformity is undesirable. Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting  and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth.  Even when building the Imperial Palace  they always leave one place unfinished. But if I had to choose one building in the world to be cast out on a desert island  to live the rest of my life  being an addict of symmetry  I would probably choose the Alhambra in Granada. This is a palace celebrating symmetry. Recently I took my family    we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips  which my family love. This is my son Tamer. You can see he's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the Alhambra. But I wanted to try and enrich him. I think one of the problems about school mathematics is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded in the world we live in. So  I wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the Alhambra. You see it already. Immediately you go in  the reflective symmetry in the water. But it's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening. The Moorish artists were denied the possibility to draw things with souls. So they explored a more geometric art. And so what is symmetry  The Alhambra somehow asks all of these questions. What is symmetry  When  there  are two of these walls  do they have the same symmetries  Can we say whether they discovered all of the symmetries in the Alhambra  And it was Galois who produced a language to be able to answer some of these questions. For Galois  symmetry    unlike for Thomas Mann  which was something still and deathly    for Galois  symmetry was all about motion. What can you do to a symmetrical object  move it in some way  so it looks the same as before you moved it  I like to describe it as the magic trick moves. What can you do to something  You close your eyes. I do something  put it back down again. It looks like it did before it started. So  for example  the walls in the Alhambra    I can take all of these tiles  and fix them at the yellow place  rotate them by    degrees  put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there. And if you open your eyes again  you wouldn't know that they'd moved. But it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry inside the Alhambra. But it's also about producing a language to describe this. And the power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another  to change geometry into language. So I'm going to take you through  perhaps push you a little bit mathematically    so brace yourselves    push you a little bit to understand how this language works  which enables us to capture what is symmetry. So  let's take these two symmetrical objects here. Let's take the twisted six pointed starfish. What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same  Well  there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn  and still it looks like it did before I started. I could rotate it by a third of a turn  or a half a turn  or put it back down on its image  or two thirds of a turn. And a fifth symmetry  I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn. And those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object that make it look like it did before I started. Now  for Galois  there was actually a sixth symmetry. Can anybody think what else I could do to this which would leave it like I did before I started  I can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it  haven't I  It's got no reflective symmetry. But what I could do is just leave it where it is  pick it up  and put it down again. And for Galois this was like the zeroth symmetry. Actually  the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept  seventh century A.D.  by the Indians. It seems mad to talk about nothing. And this is the same idea. This is a symmetrical    so everything has symmetry  where you just leave it where it is. So  this object has six symmetries. And what about the triangle  Well  I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise or a third of a turn anticlockwise. But now this has some reflectional symmetry. I can reflect it in the line through X  or the line through Y  or the line through Z. Five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry where I just pick it up and leave it where it is. So both of these objects have six symmetries. Now  I'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport  and you have to do some mathematics in order to really understand it. So here is a little question for you. And I'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk for the person who gets closest to the answer. The Rubik's Cube. How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have  How many things can I do to this object and put it down so it still looks like a cube  Okay  So I want you to think about that problem as we go on  and count how many symmetries there are. And there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end. But let's go back down to symmetries that I got for these two objects. What Galois realized  it isn't just the individual symmetries  but how they interact with each other which really characterizes the symmetry of an object. If I do one magic trick move followed by another  the combination is a third magic trick move. And here we see Galois starting to develop a language to see the substance of the things unseen  the sort of abstract idea of the symmetry underlying this physical object. For example  what if I turn the starfish by a sixth of a turn  and then a third of a turn  So I've given names. The capital letters  A  B  C  D  E  F  are the names for the rotations. B  for example  rotates the little yellow dot to the B on the starfish. And so on. So what if I do B  which is a sixth of a turn  followed by C  which is a third of a turn  Well let's do that. A sixth of a turn  followed by a third of a turn  the combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go. So the little table here records how the algebra of these symmetries work. I do one followed by another  the answer is it's rotation D  half a turn. What I if I did it in the other order  Would it make any difference  Let's see. Let's do the third of the turn first  and then the sixth of a turn. Of course  it doesn't make any difference. It still ends up at half a turn. And there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other. But this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle. Let's see what happens if we do two symmetries with the triangle  one after the other. Let's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise  and reflect in the line through X. Well  the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z to start with. Now  let's do it in a different order. Let's do the reflection in X first  followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise. The combined effect  the triangle ends up somewhere completely different. It's as if it was reflected in the line through Y. Now it matters what order you do the operations in. And this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects    they both have six symmetries. So why shouldn't we say they have the same symmetries  But the way the symmetries interact enable us    we've now got a language to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different. And you can try this when you go down to the pub  later on. Take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn  then flip it. And then do it in the other order  and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction. Now  Galois produced some laws for how these tables    how symmetries interact. It's almost like little Sudoku tables. You don't see any symmetry twice in any row or column. And  using those rules  he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries. And they'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle  or the symmetries of the six pointed starfish. I think this is an amazing development. It's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry. In the front here  I've got one  two  three people sitting on one  two  three chairs. The people and the chairs are very different  but the number  the abstract idea of the number  is the same. And we can see this now  we go back to the walls in the Alhambra. Here are two very different walls  very different geometric pictures. But  using the language of Galois  we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same. For example  let's take this beautiful wall with the triangles with a little twist on them. You can rotate them by a sixth of a turn if you ignore the colors. We're not matching up the colors. But the shapes match up if I rotate by a sixth of a turn around the point where all the triangles meet. What about the center of a triangle  I can rotate by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle  and everything matches up. And then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge  where I can rotate by     degrees. And all the tiles match up again. So rotate along halfway along the edge  and they all match up. Now  let's move to the very different looking wall in the Alhambra. And we find the same symmetries here  and the same interaction. So  there was a sixth of a turn. A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet. And the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars. And although these walls look very different  Galois has produced a language to say that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same. And it's a symmetry we call      . Here is another example in the Alhambra. This is a wall  a ceiling  and a floor. They all look very different. But this language allows us to say that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object  which we call      . Nothing to do with football  but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate by a quarter of a turn  and one by half a turn. Now  this power of the language is even more  because Galois can say   Did the Moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries on the walls in the Alhambra   And it turns out they almost did. You can prove  using Galois' language  there are actually only    different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra. And they  if you try to produce a different wall with this   th one  it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these   . But these are things that we can see. And the power of Galois' mathematical language is it also allows us to create symmetrical objects in the unseen world  beyond the two dimensional  three dimensional  all the way through to the four  or five  or infinite dimensional space. And that's where I work. I create mathematical objects  symmetrical objects  using Galois' language  in very high dimensional spaces. So I think it's a great example of things unseen  which the power of mathematical language allows you to create. So  like Galois  I stayed up all last night creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you  and I've got a picture of it here. Well  unfortunately it isn't really a picture. If I could have my board at the side here  great  excellent. Here we are. Unfortunately  I can't show you a picture of this symmetrical object. But here is the language which describes how the symmetries interact. Now  this new symmetrical object does not have a name yet. Now  people like getting their names on things  on craters on the moon or new species of animals. So I'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object which hasn't been named before. And this thing    species die away  and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode    but this mathematical object will live forever. It will make you immortal. In order to win this symmetrical object  what you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning. How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have  Okay  I'm going to sort you out. Rather than you all shouting out  I want you to count how many digits there are in that number. Okay  If you've got it as a factorial  you've got to expand the factorials. Okay  now if you want to play  I want you to stand up  okay  If you think you've got an estimate for how many digits  right    we've already got one competitor here. If you all stay down he wins it automatically. Okay. Excellent. So we've got four here  five  six. Great. Excellent. That should get us going. All right. Anybody with five or less digits  you've got to sit down  because you've underestimated. Five or less digits. So  if you're in the tens of thousands you've got to sit down.    digits or more  you've got to sit down. You've overestimated.    digits or less  sit down. How many digits are there in your number  Two  So you should have sat down earlier. Let's have the other ones  who sat down during the     up again. Okay  If I told you    or less  stand up. Because this one. I think there were a few here. The people who just last sat down. Okay  how many digits do you have in your number    . Okay good. How many do you have in yours    . So it goes to this lady here.    is the closest. It actually has    the number of symmetries in the Rubik's cube has    digits. So now I need to name this object. So  what is your name  I need your surname. Symmetrical objects generally    spell it for me. G H E Z No  SO  has already been used  actually  in the mathematical language. So you can't have that one. So Ghez  there we go. That's your new symmetrical object. You are now immortal. And if you'd like your own symmetrical object  I have a project raising money for a charity in Guatemala  where I will stay up all night and devise an object for you  for a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in Guatemala. And I think what drives me  as a mathematician  are those things which are not seen  the things that we haven't discovered. It's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject. And I will always come back to this quote from the Japanese  Essays in Idleness    In everything  uniformity is undesirable. Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting  and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth.  Thank you. I believe that there are new  hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions    institutions that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life  schools  hospitals  workplaces  factories  offices  etc. And something that I see happening is something that I would like to call a sort of  democratization of intimacy.  And what do I mean by that  I mean that what people are doing is  in fact  they are sort of  with their communication channels  they are breaking an imposed isolation that these institutions are imposing on them. How are they doing this  They're doing it in a very simple way  by calling their mom from work  by IMing from their office to their friends  by texting under the desk. The pictures that you're seeing behind me are people that I visited in the last few months. And I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most. And somebody brought a boyfriend  somebody a father. One young woman brought her grandfather. For    years  I've been looking at how people use channels such as email  the mobile phone  texting  etc. What we're actually going to see is that  fundamentally  people are communicating on a regular basis with five  six  seven of their most intimate sphere. Now  lets take some data. Facebook. Recently some sociologists from Facebook    Facebook is the channel that you would expect is the most enlargening of all channels. And an average user  said Cameron Marlow  from Facebook  has about     friends. But he actually talks to  has two way exchanges with  about four to six people on a regular base  depending on his gender. Academic research on instant messaging also shows     people on buddy lists  but fundamentally people chat with two  three  four    anyway  less than five. My own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that    percent of the calls are actually made to four people.    percent. And when you go to Skype  it's down to two people. A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed. I mean  I've been a bit disappointed sometimes when I saw this data and all this deployment  just for five people. And some sociologists actually feel that it's a closure  it's a cocooning  that we're disengaging from the public. And I would actually  I would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it  and from where they're doing it  actually there is an incredible social transformation. There are three stories that I think are quite good examples. The first gentleman  he's a baker. And so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning. And around eight o'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven  cleans his hands from the flour and calls his wife. He just wants to wish her a good day  because that's the start of her day. And I've heard this story a number of times. A young factory worker who works night shifts  who manages to sneak away from the factory floor  where there is CCTV by the way  and find a corner  where at    o'clock at night he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight. Or a mother who  at four o'clock  suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet to check that her children are safely home. Then there is another couple  there is a Brazilian couple. They've lived in Italy for a number of years. They Skype with their families a few times a week. But once a fortnight  they actually put the computer on their dining table  pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it. And I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very modest family of immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland. They had set up a big screen in their living room  and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother. But Danny Miller  who is a very good anthropologist who is working on Filipina migrant women who leave their children back in the Philippines  was telling me about how much parenting is going on through Skype  and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype. And then there is the third couple. They are two friends. They chat to each other every day  a few times a day actually. And finally  finally  they've managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work. And now  obviously  they have it open. Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other. And this is exactly what we've been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school  under the table  and texting under the table to their friends. So  none of these cases are unique. I mean  I could tell you hundreds of them. But what is really exceptional is the setting. So  think of the three settings I've talked to you about  factory  migration  office. But it could be in a school  it could be an administration  it could be a hospital. Three settings that  if we just step back    years  if you just think back    years  when you clocked in  when you clocked in to an office  when you clocked in to a factory  there was no contact for the whole duration of the time  there was no contact with your private sphere. If you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere. If you were in management  oh  that was a different story. Maybe you had a direct line. If you were not  you maybe had to go through an operator. But basically  when you walked into those buildings  the private sphere was left behind you. And this has become such a norm of our professional lives  such a norm and such an expectation. And it had nothing to do with technical capability. The phones were there. But the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand  fully to the people around you. That was where the focus had to be. And this has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage. If you think nursery  kindergarten  first years of school are just dedicated to take away the children  to make them used to staying long hours away from their family. And then the school enacts perfectly well. It mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices  rituals of entry  rituals of exit  the schedules  the uniforms in this country  things that identify you  team building activities  team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids  or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time. And of course  the major thing  learn to pay attention  to concentrate and focus your attention. This only started about     years ago. It only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy  and of industrial revolution. When people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work. And when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach  where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere. So  until then  basically people were living on top of their trades. They were living on top of the land they were laboring. They were living on top of the workshops where they were working. And if you think  it's permeated our whole culture  even our cities. If you think of medieval cities  medieval cities the boroughs all have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there. Now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas. And actually  over these     years  there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged. So the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out  the more removed he would be from his personal sphere. People have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations. And they are doing it massively. The Pew Institute  which produces good data on a regular basis on  for instance  in the States  says that    and I think that this number is conservative       percent of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email from his office. I really think that the number is conservative. In my own research  we saw that the peak for private email is actually    o'clock in the morning  whatever the country.    percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones.     percent are using text. The point is that this re appropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions. I'm always surprised the U.S. Army sociologists are discussing of the impact for instance  of soldiers in Iraq having daily contact with their families. But there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access. And every day  every single day  I read news that makes me cringe  like a     fine to kids in Texas  for using  every time they take out their mobile phone in school. Immediate dismissal to bus drivers in New York  if seen with a mobile phone in a hand. Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook. Behind issues of security and safety  which have always been the arguments for social control  in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who  in fact  has a right to self determine their attention  to decide  whether they should  or not  be isolated. And they are actually trying to block  in a certain sense  this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy. A few years ago  my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry. In       young Qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps. And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights. In the last six months  more than     skyscrapers in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled. Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often indentured construction worker.  .  million of them. Mainly Indian  Pakistani  Sri Lankan and Nepalese  these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home. They pay a middle man thousands of dollars to be there. And when they arrive  they find themselves in labor camps with no water  no air conditioning  and their passports taken away. While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities     percent of these people are hired by the private sector  and so therefore we're equally  if not more  accountable. Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged  but the numbers are simply overwhelming. In August       UAE public officials noted that    percent of the country's       labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations. And last summer  more than        workers protested for the non payment of wages  for the poor quality of food  and inadequate housing. And then the financial collapse happened. When the contractors have gone bust  as they've been overleveraged like everyone else  the difference is everything goes missing  documentation  passports  and tickets home for these workers. Currently  right now  thousands of workers are abandoned. There is no way back home. And there is no way  and no proof of arrival. These are the boom and bust refugees. The question is  as a building professional  as an architect  an engineer  as a developer  if you know this is going on  as we go to the sights every single week  are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations  So let's forget your environmental footprint. Let's think about your ethical footprint. What good is it to build a zero carbon  energy efficient complex  when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best  Now  recently I've been told I've been taking the high road. But  quite frankly  on this issue  there is no other road. So let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse. And that as we worry about our next job in the office  the next design that we can get  to keep our workers. Let's not forget these men  who are truly dying to work. Thank you. I'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper. Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change  and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog. They are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science. Recently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  or IPCC  put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system. That report was written by     scientists from    countries. They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic. And all of those pages were reviewed by another     plus scientists and reviewers  from     countries. It's a big community. It's such a big community  in fact  that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world. Over        scientists go to San Francisco every year for that. And every one of those scientists is in a research group  and every research group studies a wide variety of topics. For us at Cambridge  it's as varied as the El Ni o oscillation  which affects weather and climate  to the assimilation of satellite data  to emissions from crops that produce biofuels  which is what I happen to study. And in each one of these research areas  of which there are even more  there are PhD students  like me  and we study incredibly narrow topics  things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules. And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene  which is here. It's a small organic molecule. You've probably never heard of it. The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to     zeta illion       to the   st    molecules of isoprene. But despite its very small weight  enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet. It's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane. And because it's so much stuff  it's really important for the atmospheric system. Because it's important to the atmospheric system  we go to all lengths to study this thing. We blow it up and look at the pieces. This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain. Atmospheric explosions  or full combustion  takes about        times longer than what happens in your car. But still  we look at the pieces. We run enormous models on supercomputers  this is what I happen to do. Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each  on minute timescales. And it takes weeks to perform our integrations. And we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening. We also fly all over the world looking for this thing. I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia. There are others. We found a global atmospheric watchtower there  in the middle of the rainforest  and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower  to look for isoprene  and of course  other things while we were there. This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest  from above. And this is the tower from below. And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us. And this plane  the model  BA     which was run by FAAM  normally flies     to     people. So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today. But we didn't just fly it. We were flying at     meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule    incredibly dangerous stuff. We have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements. We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering. We have to get special flight clearance. And as you come around the banks in these valleys  the forces can get up to two Gs. And the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they're on board. So  as you can imagine  the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation. It's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule. We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule. And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule  they write one scientific paper on the subject. And out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules. And as a body of knowledge builds up  it will form one subsection  or one sub subsection of an assessment like the IPCC  although we have others. And each one of the    chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections. So you can imagine the scale of the effort. In each one of those assessments that we write  we always tag on a summary  and the summary is written for a non scientific audience. And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers  in order to make headlines like these. Thank you very much. I started my journey    years ago. And I worked in mines. And I realized that this was a world unseen. And I wanted  through color and large format cameras and very large prints  to make a body of work that somehow became symbols of our use of the landscape  how we use the land. And to me this was a key component that somehow  through this medium of photography  which allows us to contemplate these landscapes  that I thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work. And after    years of photographing large industrial landscapes  it occurred to me that oil is underpinning the scale and speed. Because that is what has changed  is the speed at which we're taking all our resources. And so then I went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil. And what I want to do is to kind of map an arc that there is extraction  where we're taking it from the ground  refinement. And that's one chapter. The other chapter that I wanted to look at was how we use it    our cities  our cars  our motorcultures  where people gather around the vehicle as a celebration. And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil  this entropic end  where all of our parts of cars  our tires  oil filters  helicopters  planes    where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up  And to me  again  photography was a way in which I could explore and research the world  and find those places. And another idea that I had as well  that was brought forward by an ecologist    he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of gas and said  well  how much carbon it would take  and how much organic material  It was    metric tons for one liter. So whenever I fill up my gas  I think of that liter  and how much carbon. And I know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton  but he did the calculations for our Earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy. From the photosynthetic growth  it would take     years of that growth to produce what we use  the    billion barrels we use per year. And that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society. Looking at    billion per year  we look at our two largest suppliers  Saudi Arabia and now Canada  with its dirty oil. And together they only form about    years of supply. The whole world  at  .  trillion estimated reserves  only gives us about    years. So  it's not a question of if  but a question of when peak oil will come upon us. So  to me  using photography    and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents  our ways of thinking  to begin to deal with what I think is probably one of the most challenging issues of our time  how to deal with our energy crisis. And I would like to say that  on the other side of it         years from now  the children that I have  I can look at them and say   We did everything we possibly  humanly could do  to begin to mitigate this  what I feel is one of the most important and critical moments in our time. Thank you. I'd like to ask you  what do these three people have in common  Well  you probably recognize the first person. I'm sure you're all avid  American Idol  watchers. But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani  who is a contestant  indeed a finalist  in the Poet of the Millions competition  which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi  and seen throughout the Arab world. In this contest people have to write and recite original poetry  in the Nabati form of poetry  which is the traditional Bedouin form. And Lima Sahar was a finalist in the Afghan Star singing competition. Now  before I go any further  yes  I know it all began with  Britain's Got Talent.  But my point in discussing this is to show you    I hope I'll be able to show you how these merit based competitions  with equal access to everyone  with the winner selected via voting by SMS  are changing tribal societies. And I'm going to focus on Afghanistan and the Arab world with the UAE  how they're changing tribal societies  not by introducing Western ideas  but by being integrated into the language in those places. It all begins with enjoyment. Video  We are late to watch  Afghan Star.  We are going to watch  Afghan Star.  We are late. We are running late. We must go to watch  Afghan Star.  Cynthia Schneider  These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society. In Afghanistan  people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program. And you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set. People watch it all over the country also in public places. But it goes beyond watching  because also  part of this is campaigning. People become so engaged that they have volunteers  just like political volunteers anyway  who fan out over the countryside  campaigning for their candidate. Contestants also put themselves forward. Now  of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance  but not entirely. Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group. This has opened up the door  particularly for women. And in the last season there were two women in the finalists. One of them  Lima Sahar  is a Pashtun from Kandahar  a very conservative part of the country. And here she relates  in the documentary film  Afghan Star   how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy. But she also confides that she knows that members of the Taliban are actually SMS ing votes in for her. Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks and put herself out  to compete in the Poet of the Millions competition. I have to say  her husband backed her from the start. But her tribe and family urged her not to compete and were very much against it. But  once she started to win  then they got behind her again. It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value. And she's out there. Her poetry is about women  and the life of women in society. So just by presenting herself and being in competition with men    this shows the voting on the program    it sets a very important example for young women    these are young women in the audience of the program    in Abu Dhabi  but also people in the viewing audience. Now you'd think that  American Idol  would introduce a measure of Americanization. But actually  just the opposite is happening. By using this engaging popular format for traditional  local culture  it actually  in the Gulf  is precipitating a revival of interest in Nabati poetry  also in traditional dress and dance and music. And for Afghanistan  where the Taliban banned music for many years  it is reintroducing their traditional music. They don't sing pop songs  they sing Afghan music. And they also have learned how to lose gracefully  without avenging the winner. No small thing. And the final  sort of  formulation of this  American Idol  format  which has just appeared in Afghanistan  is a new program called  The Candidate.  And in this program  people present policy platforms that are then voted on. Many of them are too young to run for president  but by putting the issues out there  they are influencing the presidential race. So for me  the substance of things unseen is how reality TV is driving reality. Thank you. We grew up interacting with the physical objects around us. There are an enormous number of them that we use every day. Unlike most of our computing devices  these objects are much more fun to use. When you talk about objects  one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing  and that is gestures  how we manipulate these objects  how we use these objects in everyday life. We use gestures not only to interact with these objects  but we also use them to interact with each other. A gesture of  Namaste    maybe  to respect someone  or maybe  in India I don't need to teach a kid that this means  four runs  in cricket. It comes as a part of our everyday learning. So  I am very interested  from the beginning  how our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures  and how we use these objects  can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world. Rather than using a keyboard and mouse  why can I not use my computer in the same way that I interact in the physical world  So  I started this exploration around eight years back  and it literally started with a mouse on my desk. Rather than using it for my computer  I actually opened it. Most of you might be aware that  in those days  the mouse used to come with a ball inside  and there were two rollers that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving  and  accordingly  where the mouse is moving. So  I was interested in these two rollers  and I actually wanted more  so I borrowed another mouse from a friend    never returned to him    and I now had four rollers. Interestingly  what I did with these rollers is  basically  I took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line. It had some strings and pulleys and some springs. What I got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion sensing device made for two dollars. So  here  whatever movement I do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that I made  around eight years back  in     . Because I was interested in integrating these two worlds  I thought of sticky notes. I thought   Why can I not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world   A message written on a sticky note to my mom  on paper  can come to an SMS  or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar    a to do list that automatically syncs with you. But you can also search in the digital world  or maybe you can write a query  saying   What is Dr. Smith's address   and this small system actually prints it out    so it actually acts like a paper input output system  just made out of paper. In another exploration  I thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions. So  I implemented this pen that can help designers and architects not only think in three dimensions  but they can actually draw  so that it's more intuitive to use that way. Then I thought   Why not make a Google Map  but in the physical world   Rather than typing a keyword to find something  I put my objects on top of it. If I put a boarding pass  it will show me where the flight gate is. A coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee  or where you can trash the cup. So  these were some of the earlier explorations I did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly. Among all these experiments  there was one thing in common  I was trying to bring a part of the physical world to the digital world. I was taking some part of the objects  or any of the intuitiveness of real life  and bringing them to the digital world  because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive. But then I realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing. What we are interested in is information. We want to know about things. We want to know about dynamic things going around. So I thought  around last year    in the beginning of the last year    I started thinking   Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way   Maybe   How about I take my digital world and paint the physical world with that digital information   Because pixels are actually  right now  confined in these rectangular devices that fit in our pockets. Why can I not remove this confine and take that to my everyday objects  everyday life so that I don't need to learn the new language for interacting with those pixels  So  in order to realize this dream  I actually thought of putting a big size projector on my head. I think that's why this is called a head mounted projector  isn't it  I took it very literally  and took my bike helmet  put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely. So now  what I can do    I can augment the world around me with this digital information. But later  I realized that I actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels  also. So I put a small camera over there that acts as a digital eye. Later  we moved to a much better  consumer oriented pendant version of that  that many of you now know as the SixthSense device. But the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can carry your digital world with you wherever you go. You can start using any surface  any wall around you  as an interface. The camera is actually tracking all your gestures. Whatever you're doing with your hands  it's understanding that gesture. And  actually  if you see  there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it. You can start painting on any wall. You stop by a wall  and start painting on that wall. But we are not only tracking one finger  here. We are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands  so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present. The camera is actually doing    just  getting all the images    is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms are going on inside. So  technically  it's a little bit complex  but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use  in some sense. But I'm more excited that you can actually take it outside. Rather than getting your camera out of your pocket  you can just do the gesture of taking a photo  and it takes a photo for you. Thank you. And later I can find a wall  anywhere  and start browsing those photos or maybe   OK  I want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend.  So  we are looking for an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world. And  of course  if you don't have any surface  you can start using your palm for simple operations. Here  I'm dialing a phone number just using my hand. The camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements  but  interestingly  is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand. For example  in this case  the book cover is matched with so many thousands  or maybe millions of books online  and checking out which book it is. Once it has that information  it finds out more reviews about that  or maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that  so you can actually hear  on a physical book  a review as sound. This was Obama's visit last week to MIT. Pranav Mistry  So  I was seeing the live  video  of his talk  outside  on just a newspaper. Your newspaper will show you live weather information rather than having it updated. You have to check your computer in order to do that  right  When I'm going back  I can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed  because at that particular time  I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone  and checking out a particular icon. And I think this technology will not only change the way    Yes. It will change the way we interact with people  also  not only the physical world. The fun part is  I'm going to the Boston metro  and playing a pong game inside the train on the ground  right  And I think the imagination is the only limit of what you can think of when this kind of technology merges with real life. But many of you argue  actually  that all of our work is not only about physical objects. We actually do lots of accounting and paper editing and all those kinds of things  what about that  And many of you are excited about the next generation tablet computers to come out in the market. So  rather than waiting for that  I actually made my own  just using a piece of paper. So  what I did here is remove the camera    All the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera. I removed the microphone from that  and then just pinched that    like I just made a clip out of the microphone    and clipped that to a piece of paper  any paper that you found around. So now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly I'm touching the paper. But the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving. You can of course watch movies. and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe   .  PM  And you can of course play games. Here  the camera is actually understanding how you're holding the paper and playing a car racing game. Many of you already must have thought  OK  you can browse. Yeah. Of course you can browse to any websites or you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper wherever you need it. So  more interestingly  I'm interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way. When I come back to my desk  I can just pinch that information back to my desktop so I can use my full size computer. And why only computers  We can just play with papers. Paper world is interesting to play with. Here  I'm taking a part of a document  and putting over here a second part from a second place  and I'm actually modifying the information that I have over there. Yeah. And I say   OK  this looks nice  let me print it out  that thing.  So I now have a print out of that thing. So the workflow is more intuitive  the way we used to do it maybe    years back  rather than now switching between these two worlds. So  as a last thought  I think that integrating information to everyday objects will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide  the gap between these two worlds  but will also help us  in some way  to stay human  to be more connected to our physical world. And it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines. That's all. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  So  Pranav  first of all  you're a genius. This is incredible  really. What are you doing with this  Is there a company being planned  Or is this research forever  or what  Pranav Mistry  So  there are lots of companies  sponsor companies of Media Lab interested in taking this ahead in one or another way. Companies like mobile phone operators want to take this in a different way than the NGOs in India  thinking   Why can we only have 'Sixth Sense'  We should have a 'Fifth Sense' for missing sense people who cannot speak. This technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way maybe a speaker system.  CA  What are your own plans  Are you staying at MIT  or are you going to do something with this  PM  I'm trying to make this more available to people so that anyone can develop their own SixthSense device  because the hardware is actually not that hard to manufacture or hard to make your own. We will provide all the open source software for them  maybe starting next month. CA  Open source  Wow. CA  Are you going to come back to India with some of this  at some point  PM  Yeah. Yes  yes  of course. CA  What are your plans  MIT  India  How are you going to split your time going forward  PM  There is a lot of energy here. Lots of learning. All of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in India. And now  if you see  it's more about the cost effectiveness  this system costs you      compared to the         surface tables  or anything like that. Or maybe even the    mouse gesture system at that time was costing around         I showed that  at a conference  to President Abdul Kalam  at that time  and then he said   OK  we should use this in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre for some use of that.  So I'm excited about how I can bring the technology to the masses rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment. CA  Based on the people we've seen at TED  I would say you're truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now. It's an honor to have you at TED. Thank you so much. That's fantastic. One morning  in the year       the neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield saw himself like this  a weird freak with huge hands  huge mouth  and a tiny bottom. Actually this creature is the result of the Penfield research. He named it homunculus. Basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain. So  of course  homunculus is definitely not a freak. It's you. It's me. It's our invisible reality. This visualization could explain  for example  why newborns  or smokers  put  instinctively  their fingers in the mouth. Unfortunately it doesn't explain why so many designers remain mainly interested in designing chairs. So anyway  even if I do not understand science entirely  for my design I essentially refer to it. I'm fascinated by its ability to deeply investigate the human being  its way of working  its way of feeling. And it really helps me to understand how we see  how we hear  how we breathe  how our brain can inform or mislead us. It's a great tool for me to understand what could be our real needs. Marketing people have never been able to do that. Marketing reduces things. Marketing simplifies. Marketing creates user groups. And scientists  amidst complexity  amidst fluctuation and uniqueness. What could be our real needs  Maybe the silence. In our daily life we are continuously disturbed by aggressive sounds. And you know all those kind of sound puts us in a kind of stressful state  and prevent us from being quiet and focused. So I wanted to create a kind of sound filter  able to preserve ourselves from noise pollution. But I didn't want it to make it by isolating people  without any earmuffs or those kind of things. Or neither with including complex technology. I just wanted to  using the complexity and the technology of the brain  of the human brain. So I worked with white noise. dB is basically    dB is the name of the product  basically a white noise diffuser. This is white noise. The white noise is the sum of all frequencies that are audible by the human being  brought to the same intensity. And this noise is like a  shhhhhhhhhhhhh   like that. And this noise is the most neutral. It is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain. So when you hear this sound you feel like a kind of shelter  preserved from noise pollution. And when you hear the white noise  your brain is immediately focused on it. And do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound. It seems to be magic. But it is just physiology. It's just in your brain. And in mine  I hope. So in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive  I create a ball  a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive sound come from  and roll  at home or at work  towards aggressive noise  and emits white noise in order to neutralize it. It works. You feel the effect of the white noise  It's too in silence. If you make some noise you can feel the effect. So even if this object  even if this product includes some technology  it includes some speakers  it includes some microphones and some electronic devices  this object is not a very smart object. And I don't want to make a very smart object. I don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot. I want to create an object like you and me. So  definitely not perfect. So imagine  for instance  you are at home. A loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend. You shout. You say   Blah blah blah  Blah blah blah. Who is this guy   And dB will probably roll toward you. And turning around you is  shhhhhhh   like that. Definitely not perfect. So you would probably shut it  at this point. Anyway  in this same kind of approach  I designed K. K is a daylight receiver transmitter. So this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk  or on your piano  where you are supposed to spend most of your time in the day. And this object will be able to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day  and able to give you the quantity of light you need. This object is completely covered by fiber opticals. And the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object  for sure  but creates the idea of an eye sensibility of the object. I want  by this design feel  when you see it  you see  instinctively  this object seems to be very sensitive  very reactive. And this object knows  better than you and probably before you  what you really need. You have to know that the lack of daylight can provoke some problem of energy  or problem of libido. So  a huge problem. Most of the projects I work on    I live in collaboration with scientists. I'm just a designer. So I need them. So there can be some biologists  psychiatrists  mathematicians  and so on. And I submit them  my intuitions  my hypothesis  my first ideas. And they react. They told me what is possible  what is impossible. And together we improve the original concept. And we build the project to the end. And this kind of relationship between designer and scientist started when I was at school. Indeed in my studies I was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical industry. And the irony for me was of course  I didn't do that for the sake of science progress. I just do that to make money. Anyway  this project  or this experience  make me start a new project on the design of medicine. You have to know that today  roughly one or two every drug pills is not taken correctly. So even if the active constituents in pharmaceuticals made constant progress in terms of chemistry  target of stability  the behavior of the patients goes more and more unstable. So we took too many of them. We took irregular dosage. We do not follow instructions. And so on. So I wanted to create a new kind of medicine  in order to create a new kind of relationship between the patient and the treatment. So I turned traditional pills into this. I'm going to give you some example. This one is an antibiotic. And its purpose is to help patient to go to the end of the treatment. And the concept is to create a kind of onion  a kind of structure in layers. So  you start with the darkest one. And you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment. And you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection. So the first day  this is the big one. And you have to peel and eat one layer a day. And your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer. And you're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the Christmas day. And you follow the treatment like that  to the end of the treatment. And here you can get the white core. And it means  right  you are in the recovery. This one is a  third lung   a pharmaceutical device for long term asthma treatment. I designed it to help kids to follow the treatment. So the idea of this one is to create a relationship between the patient of the treatment but a relationship of dependency. But in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient. This is  the kids will feel the therapeutic object needs him. So the idea is  all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself  including air and molecules  for sure. And when the kids wake up  he can see the object needs him. And he take him to his mouth  and breathe the air it contains. So by this way  the kid  to take care of himself  is to take care of this living object. And he does not feel anymore it's relies on asthma treatment  as the asthma treatment needs him. In this guise of living object approach  I like the idea of a kind of invisible design  as if the function of the object exists in a kind of invisible field just around the objects themselves. We could talk about a kind of soul  of a ghost accompanying them. And almost a kind of poltergeist effect. So when a passive object like this one seems to be alive  because it is    woosh    starting to move. And I remember an exhibition design I made for John Maeda  and for the Fondation Cartier in Paris. And John Maeda was supposed to show several graphic animations in this exhibition. And my idea for this exhibition design was to create a real pong game  like this one. And the idea was to create some self moving benches in the main exhibition room. So the living benches would be exactly like the ball. And John was so excited by this idea. He said to me   Okay let's go.  I remember the day of the opening. I was a little bit late. When I bring the    living and self moving benches in the exhibition room  John was just beside me  and was like   Hmm. Hmm.  And he told me  after a long silence   I wonder  Mathieu  if people won't be more fascinated by your benches than by my videos.  It would be a great honor  a great compliment for me  if he hadn't decided to take all them off two hours before the opening. So  huge tragedy. I guess you won't be surprised if I tell you that Pinocchio is one of my great influences. Pinocchio is probably one of my best design products  my favorite one. Because it is a kind of object with a conscience  able to be modified by its surroundings  and able to modify it as well. The other great influence is the mine's canary. In coal mines  this canary was supposed to be close to the miners. And it was singing all day long. And when it stops it means that it just died. So this canary was a living alarm  and a very efficient one. A very natural technology  in order to say to the miners   The air is too bad. You have to go. It's an emergency.  So it's  for me  a great product. And I tried to design a kind of canary. Andrea is one. Andrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses from air  contaminated indoor air. So it uses some plants to do this job  selected for their gas filtering ability. You have to know  or you probably already know  that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one. So while I'm talking to you  the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas. Sorry for that.  Laughter  So you are currently breathing formaldehyde. It's the same for me with the carpet. And this is exactly the same at home. Because all the product we get constantly give away the volatile component of which they're made of. So let's have a look at your home. So your sofa  your plastic chair  your kid's toys give their own invisible reality. And this one is very toxic. This is the reason why I created  with David Edward  a scientist of Harvard University  an object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants. But the idea is to force the air to go in the effective part of the plants. Because the roots of the plant are not very effective. Bill Wolverton from NASA analyzed it cleverly in the '  s. So the idea is to create an object able to force the air  and to be in contact at the right speed at the right place  in all the effective parts of the plant. So this is the final object. It will be launched next September. This one is kind of the same approach because I include  in a product like Andrea  some plants. And in this one  plants are used for the water filtration ability. And it includes some fishes as well. But here  unlike Andrea  here are supposed to be eaten. Indeed  this object is a domestic farm  for fishes and green. So the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food. The locavores used to get food taken in a radius of     miles. Local River is able to provide you food directly in your living room. So the principle of this object is to create an ecosystem called aquaponics. And the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish  by a water pump  feeds the plants above. And the plants will filter  by the roots  the dirty water of the fish. After  it goes back into the fish tank. After that you have two options. Or you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your TV set. Amazing channel. Or you start fishing. And you make some sushis with a fish and the aromatic plants above. Because you can grow some potatoes. No  not potatoes  but tomatoes  aromatic plants and so on. So now we can breathe safely. Now we can eat local food. Now we can be treated by smart medicine. Now we can be well balanced in our biorhythm with daylight. But it was important to create a perfect place  so I tried to  in order to work and create. So I designed  for an American scientist based in Paris  a very stimulative  brain stimulative office. I wanted to create a perfect place where you can work and play  and where your body and your brain can work together. So  in this office  you do not work anymore at your desk  like a politician. Your seat  your sleep and your play on a big geodesic island made of leather. See  like this one  In this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper  but you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave  like a prehistoric scientist. So you  like that  can make some sport during your work. In this office you do not need to go out in order to be in contact with nature. You include  directly  the nature in the floor of the office. You can see it there. This is an inspiration image to lead this project of the office. It really helped me to design it. I never show it to my client. He would be so afraid. Just for my workshop. I guess it may be the revenge of the guinea pig I was. But it's maybe the conviction as monkey and homunculus we are. All of us need to be considered according to our real nature. Thank you very much. I'm going to talk about some of my discoveries around the world through my work. These are not discoveries of planets or new technologies or science. They're discoveries of people and the way people are  and new leadership. This is Benki. Benki is a leader of the Ashaninka Nation. His people live in Brazil and in Peru. Benki comes from a village so remote up in the Amazon that to get there  either you have to fly and land on water  or go by canoe for several days. I met Benki three years ago in Sao Paulo when I'd brought him and other leaders from indigenous peoples to meet with me and leaders from around the world  because we wanted to learn from each other. We wanted to share our stories with each other. The Ashaninka people are known throughout South America for their dignity  their spirit and their resistance  starting with the Incas and continuing through the   th century with the rubber tappers. Today's biggest threat to the Ashaninka people and to Benki comes from illegal logging    the people who come into the beautiful forest and cut down ancient mahogany trees  float them down the river to world markets. Benki knew this. He could see what was happening to his forest  to his environment  because he was taken under his grandfather's wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest and the way of life of his people. His grandfather died when he was only   . And at that young age     years old  Benki became the paje of his community. Now  in the Ashaninka tradition and culture  the paje is the most important person in the community. This is the person who contains within him all the knowledge  all the wisdom of centuries and centuries of life  and not just about his people  but about everything that his people's survival depended on  the trees  the birds  the water  the soil  the forest. So when he was only    and he became the paje  he began to lead his people. He began to talk to them about the forest that they needed to protect  the way of life they needed to nurture. He explained to them that it was not a question of survival of the fittest  it was a question of understanding what they needed to survive and to protect that. Eight years later  when he was a young man of     Benki left the forest for the first time. He went       miles on an odyssey to Rio to the Earth Summit to tell the world what was happening in his tiny  little corner. And he went because he hoped the world would listen. Some did  not everybody. But if you can imagine this young man with his headdress and his flowing robe  learning a new language  Portuguese  not to mention English  going to Rio  building a bridge to reach out to people he'd never met before    a pretty hostile world. But he wasn't dismayed. Benki came back to his village full of ideas    new technologies  new research  new ways of understanding what was going on. Since that time  he's continued to work with his people  and not only the Ashaninka Nation  but all the peoples of the Amazon and beyond. He's built schools to teach children to care for the forest. Together  he's led the reforestation of over    percent of the land that had been destroyed by the loggers. He's created a cooperative to help people diversify their livelihoods. And he's brought the internet and satellite technology to the forest    both so that people themselves could monitor the deforestation  but also that he could speak from the forest to the rest of the world. If you were to meet Benki and ask him   Why are you doing this  Why are you putting yourself at risk  Why are you making yourself vulnerable to what is often a hostile world   he would tell you  as he told me   I asked myself   he said   What did my grandparents and my great grandparents do to protect the forest for me  And what am I doing   So when I think of that  I wonder what our grandchildren and our great grandchildren  when they ask themselves that question  I wonder how they will answer. For me  the world is veering towards a future we don't much want when we really think about it deep inside. It's a future we don't know the details of  but it's a future that has signs  just like Benki saw the signs around him. We know we are running out of what we need. We're running out of fresh water. We're running out of fossil fuels. We're running out of land. We know climate change is going to affect all of us. We don't know how  but we know it will. And we know that there will be more of us than ever before    five times as many people in    years than    years ago. We are running out of what we need. And we also know that the world has changed in other ways  that since      there are one third as many new countries that exist as independent entities on the planet. Egos  systems of government    figuring it out    massive change. And in addition to that  we know that five other really big countries are going to have a say in the future  a say we haven't even really started to hear yet    China  India  Russia  South Africa and Benki's own Brazil  where Benki got his civil rights only in the      constitution. But you know all that. You know more than Benki knew when he left his forest and went       miles. You also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done  because we'll get the results we've always gotten. And this reminds me of something I understand Lord Salisbury said to Queen Victoria over a hundred years ago  when she was pressing him   Please change.  He said   Change  Why change  Things are bad enough as they are.  We have to change. It's imperative to me  when I look around the world  that we need to change ourselves. We need new models of what it means to be a leader. We need new models of being a leader and a human in the world. I started life as a banker. Now I don't admit to that to anybody but my very close friends. But for the past eight years  I've done something completely different. My work has taken me around the world  where I've had the real privilege of meeting people like Benki and many others who are making change happen in their communities    people who see the world differently  who are asking different questions  who have different answers  who understand the filters that they wear when they go out into the world. This is Sanghamitra. Sanghamitra comes from Bangalore. I met Sanghamitra eight years ago when I was in Bangalore organizing a workshop with leaders of different NGO's working in some of the hardest aspects of society. Sanghamitra didn't start life as a leader of an NGO  she started her career as university professor  teaching English literature. But she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that. She loved it  but she was too detached. And so in       a long time ago  she decided to start a new organization called Samraksha focused on one of the hardest areas  one of the hardest issues in India    anywhere in the world at the time    HIV AIDS. Since that time  Samraksha has grown from strength to strength and is now one of the leading health NGO's in India. But if you just think about the state of the world and knowledge of HIV AIDS in         in India at that time it was skyrocketing and nobody understood why  and everyone was actually very  very afraid. Today there are still three million HIV positive people in India. That's the second largest population in the world. When I asked Sanghamitra   How did you get from English literature to HIV AIDS   not an obvious path  she said to me   It's all connected. Literature makes one sensitive  sensitive to people  to their dreams and to their ideas.  Since that time  under her leadership  Samraksha has been a pioneer in all fields related to HIV AIDS. They have respite homes  the first  the first care centers  the first counseling services    and not just in urban    million population Bangalore  but in the hardest to reach villages in the state of Karnataka. Even that wasn't enough. She wanted to change policy at the government level.    of their programs that she pioneered are now government policy and funded by the government. They take care of        odd people today in over       villages around Karnataka. She works with people like Murali Krishna. Murali Krishna comes from one of those villages. He lost his wife to AIDS a couple of years ago  and he's HIV positive. But he saw the work  the care  the compassion that Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village  and he wanted to be part of it. He's a Leaders' Quest fellow  and that helps him with his work. They've pioneered a different approach to villages. Instead of handing out information in pamphlets  as is so often the case  they bring theater troupes  songs  music  dance. And they sit around  and they talk about dreams. Sanghamitra told me just last week    she had just come back from two weeks in the villages  and she had a real breakthrough. They were sitting in a circle  talking about the dreams for the village. And the young women in the village spoke up and said   We've changed our dream. Our dream is for our partners  our husbands  not to be given to us because of a horoscope  but to be given to us because they've been tested for HIV.  If you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra and ask her why and how  how have you achieved so much  She would look at you and very quietly  very softly say   It just happened. It's the spirit inside.  This is Dr. Fan Jianchuan. Jianchuan comes from Sichuan Province in southwest China. He was born in       and you can imagine what his childhood looked like and felt like  and what his life has been like over the last    tumultuous years. He's been a soldier  a teacher  a politician  a vice mayor and a business man. But if you sat down and asked him   Who are you really  and what do you do   He would tell you   I'm a collector  and I curate a museum.  I was lucky  I had heard about him for years  and I finally met him earlier this year at his museum in Chengdu. He's been a collector all of his life  starting when he was four or five in the early     's. Now  just think of the early     's in China. Over a lifetime  through everything  through the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward  he's kept collecting  so that he now has over eight million pieces in his museums documenting contemporary Chinese history. These are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world  in part because they document parts of history Chinese choose to forget. For example  he's got over one million pieces documenting the Sino Japanese War  a war that's not talked about in China very much and whose heroes are not honored. Why did he do all this  Because he thought a nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past. So  from commissioning slightly larger than life bronze statues of the heroes of the Sino Japanese War  including those Chinese who then fought with each other and left mainland China to go to Taiwan  to commemorating all the unknown  ordinary soldiers who survived  by asking them to take prints of their hands  he is making sure    one man is making sure    that history is not forgotten. But it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about. This building contains the world's largest collection of documents and artifacts commemorating the U.S. role in fighting on the Chinese side in that long war    the Flying Tigers. He has nine other buildings    that are already open to the public    filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary Chinese history. Two of the most sensitive buildings include a lifetime of collection about the Cultural Revolution  a period that actually most Chinese would prefer to forget. But he doesn't want his nation ever to forget. These people inspire me  and they inspire me because they show us what is possible when you change the way you look at the world  change the way you look at your place in the world. They looked outside  and then they changed what was on the inside. They didn't go to business school. They didn't read a manual   How to Be a Good Leader in    Easy Steps.  But they have qualities we'd all recognize. They have drive  passion  commitment. They've gone away from what they did before  and they've gone to something they didn't know. They've tried to connect worlds they didn't know existed before. They've built bridges  and they've walked across them. They have a sense of the great arc of time and their tiny place in it. They know people have come before them and will follow them. And they know that they're part of a whole  that they depend on other people. It's not about them  they know that  but it has to start with them. And they have humility. It just happens. But we know it doesn't just happen  don't we  We know it takes a lot to make it happen  and we know the direction the world is going in. So I think we need succession planning on a global basis. We can't wait for the next generation  the new joiners  to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need. I think it has to start with us. And we know  just like they knew  how hard it is. But the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along  we have models  we have examples  like Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan. We can look at what they've done  if we look. We can learn from what they've learned. We can change the way we see ourselves in the world. And if we're lucky  we can change the way our great grandchildren will answer Benki's question. Thank you. To understand the business of mythology and what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do  you have to hear a story of Ganesha  the elephant headed god who is the scribe of storytellers  and his brother  the athletic warlord of the gods  Kartikeya. The two brothers one day decided to go on a race  three times around the world. Kartikeya leapt on his peacock and flew around the continents and the mountains and the oceans. He went around once  he went around twice  he went around thrice. But his brother  Ganesha  simply walked around his parents once  twice  thrice  and said   I won.   How come   said Kartikeya. And Ganesha said   You went around 'the world.' I went around 'my world.'  What matters more  If you understand the difference between 'the world' and 'my world ' you understand the difference between logos and mythos. 'The world' is objective  logical  universal  factual  scientific. 'My world' is subjective. It's emotional. It's personal. It's perceptions  thoughts  feelings  dreams. It is the belief system that we carry. It's the myth that we live in. 'The world' tells us how the world functions  how the sun rises  how we are born. 'My world' tells us why the sun rises  why we were born. Every culture is trying to understand itself   Why do we exist   And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life  its own customized version of mythology. Culture is a reaction to nature  and this understanding of our ancestors is transmitted generation from generation in the form of stories  symbols and rituals  which are always indifferent to rationality. And so  when you study it  you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world. Different people see things differently    different viewpoints. There is my world and there is your world  and my world is always better than your world  because my world  you see  is rational and yours is superstition. Yours is faith. Yours is illogical. This is the root of the clash of civilizations. It took place  once  in     B.C. on the banks of a river called the Indus  now in Pakistan. This river lends itself to India's name. India. Indus. Alexander  a young Macedonian  met there what he called a  gymnosophist   which means  the naked  wise man.  We don't know who he was. Perhaps he was a Jain monk  like Bahubali over here  the Gomateshwara Bahubali whose image is not far from Mysore. Or perhaps he was just a yogi who was sitting on a rock  staring at the sky and the sun and the moon. Alexander asked   What are you doing   and the gymnosophist answered   I'm experiencing nothingness.  Then the gymnosophist asked   What are you doing   and Alexander said   I am conquering the world.  And they both laughed. Each one thought that the other was a fool. The gymnosophist said   Why is he conquering the world  It's pointless.  And Alexander thought   Why is he sitting around  doing nothing  What a waste of a life.  To understand this difference in viewpoints  we have to understand the subjective truth of Alexander    his myth  and the mythology that constructed it. Alexander's mother  his parents  his teacher Aristotle told him the story of Homer's  Iliad.  They told him of a great hero called Achilles  who  when he participated in battle  victory was assured  but when he withdrew from the battle  defeat was inevitable.  Achilles was a man who could shape history  a man of destiny  and this is what you should be  Alexander.  That's what he heard.  What should you not be  You should not be Sisyphus  who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night. Don't live a life which is monotonous  mediocre  meaningless. Be spectacular     like the Greek heroes  like Jason  who went across the sea with the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece. Be spectacular like Theseus  who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull headed Minotaur. When you play in a race  win     because when you win  the exhilaration of victory is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods.  Because  you see  the Greeks believed you live only once  and when you die  you have to cross the River Styx. And if you have lived an extraordinary life  you will be welcomed to Elysium  or what the French call  Champs  lys es     the heaven of the heroes. But these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard. He heard a very different story. He heard of a man called Bharat  after whom India is called Bh rata. Bharat also conquered the world. And then he went to the top most peak of the greatest mountain of the center of the world called Meru. And he wanted to hoist his flag to say   I was here first.  But when he reached the mountain peak  he found the peak covered with countless flags of world conquerors before him  each one claiming  'I was here first' ... that's what I thought until I came here.  And suddenly  in this canvas of infinity  Bharat felt insignificant. This was the mythology of the gymnosophist. You see  he had heroes  like Ram    Raghupati Ram and Krishna  Govinda Hari. But they were not two characters on two different adventures. They were two lifetimes of the same hero. When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins. When Ram dies  Krishna is born. When Krishna dies  eventually he will be back as Ram. You see  the Indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead. But you don't cross it once. You go to and fro endlessly. It was called the Vaitarani. You go again and again and again. Because  you see  nothing lasts forever in India  not even death. And so  you have these grand rituals where great images of mother goddesses are built and worshiped for    days ... And what do you do at the end of    days  You dunk it in the river. Because it has to end. And next year  she will come back. What goes around always comes around  and this rule applies not just to man  but also the gods. You see  the gods have to come back again and again and again as Ram  as Krishna. Not only do they live infinite lives  but the same life is lived infinite times till you get to the point of it all.  Groundhog Day.  Two different mythologies. Which is right  Two different mythologies  two different ways of looking at the world. One linear  one cyclical. One believes this is the one and only life. The other believes this is one of many lives. And so  the denominator of Alexander's life was one. So  the value of his life was the sum total of his achievements. The denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity. So  no matter what he did  it was always zero. And I believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired Indian mathematicians to discover the number zero. Who knows  And that brings us to the mythology of business. If Alexander's belief influenced his behavior  if the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior  then it was bound to influence the business they were in. You see  what is business but the result of how the market behaves and how the organization behaves  And if you look at cultures around the world  all you have to do is understand the mythology and you will see how they behave and how they do business. Take a look. If you live only once  in one life cultures around the world  you will see an obsession with binary logic  absolute truth  standardization  absoluteness  linear patterns in design. But if you look at cultures which have cyclical and based on infinite lives  you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic  with opinion  with contextual thinking  with everything is relative  sort of    mostly. You look at art. Look at the ballerina  how linear she is in her performance. And then look at the Indian classical dancer  the Kuchipudi dancer  the Bharatanatyam dancer  curvaceous. And then look at business. Standard business model  vision  mission  values  processes. Sounds very much like the journey through the wilderness to the promised land  with the commandments held by the leader. And if you comply  you will go to heaven. But in India there is no  the  promised land. There are many promised lands  depending on your station in society  depending on your stage of life. You see  businesses are not run as institutions  by the idiosyncrasies of individuals. It's always about taste. It's always about my taste. You see  Indian music  for example  does not have the concept of harmony. There is no orchestra conductor. There is one performer standing there  and everybody follows. And you can never replicate that performance twice. It is not about documentation and contract. It's about conversation and faith. It's not about compliance. It's about setting  getting the job done  by bending or breaking the rules    just look at your Indian people around here  you'll see them smile  they know what it is. And then look at people who have done business in India  you'll see the exasperation on their faces. You see  this is what India is today. The ground reality is based on a cyclical world view. So  it's rapidly changing  highly diverse  chaotic  ambiguous  unpredictable. And people are okay with it. And then globalization is taking place. The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in. Which is rooted in one life culture. And a clash is going to take place  like on the banks of the Indus. It is bound to happen. I have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor. I did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why. I love mythology too much. I wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study. So  I had to teach it to myself. And mythology does not pay  well  until now. So  I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry. And I worked in the healthcare industry. And I worked as a marketing guy  and a sales guy  and a knowledge guy  and a content guy  and a training guy. I even was a business consultant  doing strategies and tactics. And I would see the exasperation between my American and European colleagues  when they were dealing with India. Example  Please tell us the process to invoice hospitals. Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly. How do you parameterize  mostly   How do you put it in a nice little software  You can't. I would give my viewpoints to people. But nobody was interested in listening to it  you see  until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group. You see  he has established the largest retail chain  called Big Bazaar. And there are more than     formats  across    cities and towns of India. And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets. And he knew very intuitively  that best practices  developed in Japan and China and Europe and America will not work in India. He knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does. He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India. So  he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer  and said   All I want to do is align belief.  Sounds so simple. But belief is not measurable. You can't measure it. You can't manage it. So  how do you construct belief  How do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian ness. Even if you are Indian  it is not very explicit  it is not very obvious. So  I tried to work on the standard model of culture  which is  develop stories  symbols and rituals. And I will share one of the rituals with you. You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan. Hindus don't have the concept of commandments. So  there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life. So  you're not really sure how you stand in front of God. So  when you go to the temple  all you seek is an audience with God. You want to see God. And you want God to see you  and hence the gods have very large eyes  large unblinking eyes  sometimes made of silver  so they look at you. Because you don't know whether you're right or wrong  and so all you seek is divine empathy.  Just know where I came from  why I did the Jugaad.   Why did I do the setting  why I don't care for the processes. Just understand me  please.  And based on this  we created a ritual for leaders. After a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store  we blindfold him  we surround him with the stakeholders  the customer  his family  his team  his boss. You read out his KRA  his KPI  you give him the keys  and then you remove the blindfold. And invariably  you see a tear  because the penny has dropped. He realizes that to succeed  he does not have to be a  professional   he does not have to cut out his emotions  he has to include all these people in his world to succeed  to make them happy  to make the boss happy  to make everyone happy. The customer is happy  because the customer is God. That sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters  behavior will happen  business will happen. And it has. So  then we come back to Alexander and to the gymnosophist. And everybody asks me   Which is the better way  this way or that way   And it's a very dangerous question  because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence. So  I will not answer the question. What I will give you is an Indian answer  the Indian head shake. Depending on the context  depending on the outcome  choose your paradigm. You see  because both the paradigms are human constructions. They are cultural creations  not natural phenomena. And so the next time you meet someone  a stranger  one request  Understand that you live in the subjective truth  and so does he. Understand it. And when you understand it you will discover something spectacular. You will discover that within infinite myths lies the eternal truth. Who sees it all  Varuna has but a thousand eyes. Indra  a hundred. You and I  only two. Thank you. Namaste. As technology progresses  and as it advances  many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent  make us smarter and more connected to the world. And what I'd like to argue is that that's not necessarily the case  as progress is simply a word for change  and with change you gain something  but you also lose something. And to really illustrate this point  what I'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with a very simple  a very common  an everyday question. And that question is this. What time is it  What time is it  If you glance at your iPhone  it's so simple to tell the time. But  I'd like to ask you  how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iPhone  How would you tell the time  say      years ago  How would you do it  Well  the way you would do it is by using a device that's called an astrolabe. So  an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world. But  at the time  in the   th century  it was the gadget of the day. It was the world's first popular computer. And it was a device that  in fact  is a model of the sky. So  the different parts of the astrolabe  in this particular type  the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars. The plate corresponds to a coordinate system. And the mater has some scales and puts it all together. If you were an educated child  you would know how to not only use the astrolabe  you would also know how to make an astrolabe. And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe  the first technical manual in the English language  was written by Geoffrey Chaucer. Yes  that Geoffrey Chaucer  in       to his little Lewis  his    year old son. And in this book  little Lewis would know the big idea. And the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection. And basically  the concept is  how do you represent the three dimensional image of the night sky that surrounds us onto a flat  portable  two dimensional surface. The idea is actually relatively simple. Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe  and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere. Each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole  onto a flat surface  where it is then recorded. So the North Star corresponds to the center of the device. The ecliptic  which is the path of the sun  moon  and planets correspond to an offset circle. The bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete. And the altitude corresponds to the plate system. Now  the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection. The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly. There is the position of the sun  moon and planets on the movable rete. And then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate. Okay  So how would you use this device  Well  let me first back up for a moment. This is an astrolabe. Pretty impressive  isn't it  And so  this astrolabe is on loan from us from the Oxford School of    Museum of History. And you can see the different components. This is the mater  the scales on the back. This is the rete. Okay. Do you see that  That's the movable part of the sky. And in the back you can see a spider web pattern. And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky. This is a rule device. And on the back are some other devices  measuring tools and scales  to be able to make some calculations. Okay  You know  I've always wanted one of these. For my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper. And this one  this is a replica from a   th century device. And it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros. But a real one would cost about as much as my house  and the house next to it  and actually every house on the block  on both sides of the street  maybe a school thrown in  and some    you know  a church. They are just incredibly expensive. But let me show you how to work this device. So let's go to step one. First thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky  if you're telling time at night. So  tonight  if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle. And there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb. Second  is you measure the altitude of Deneb. So  step two  I hold the device up  and then I sight its altitude there so I can see it clearly now. And then I measure its altitude. So  it's about    degrees. You can't see it from over there. Step three is identify the star on the front of the device. Deneb is there. I can tell. Step four is I then move the rete  move the sky  so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back. Okay  so when that happens everything lines up. I have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky. Okay  So  it is  in a sense  holding a model of the universe in my hands. And then finally  I take a rule  and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here. Right. So  that's how the device is used. So  I know what you're thinking   That's a lot of work  isn't it  Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time   as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time. But there is a difference between the two  because with your iPod you can tell    or your iPhone  you can tell exactly what the time is  with precision. The way little Lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky. He would know where things would fit in the sky. He would not only know what time it was  he would also know where the sun would rise  and how it would move across the sky. He would know what time the sun would rise  and what time it would set. And he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens. So  in computer graphics and computer user interface design  there is a term called affordances. So  affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it. And what the astrolabe does is it allows us  it affords us  to connect to the night sky  to look up into the night sky and be much more    to see the visible and the invisible together. So  that's just one use. Incredible  there is probably          uses. In fact  there is a text  and that has over a thousand uses of this first computer. On the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation. You can survey with it. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it. It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types. And it would take a full university course to illustrate it. Astrolabes have an incredible history. They are over       years old. The concept of stereographic projection originated in     B.C. And the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms. There is portable ones. There is large display ones. And I think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful works of art. There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable. Astrolabes  like every technology  do evolve over time. So  the earliest retes  for example  were very simple and primitive. And advancing retes became cultural emblems. This is one from Oxford. And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical  and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical  or random sky. How cool is that  This is just amazing. So  would little Lewis have an astrolabe  Probably not one made of brass. He would have one made out of wood  or paper. And the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket. So  what does the astrolabe inspire  Well  I think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were  our forebears were  years and years ago. It's just an incredible device. Every technology advances. Every technology is transformed and moved by others. And what we gain with a new technology  of course  is precision and accuracy. But what we lose  I think  is an accurate    a felt sense of the sky  a sense of context. Knowing the sky  knowing your relationship with the sky  is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is. So  it's    I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices. And so  what can you learn from these devices  Well  primarily that there is a subtle knowledge that we can connect with the world. And astrolabes return us to this subtle sense of how things all fit together  and also how we connect to the world. Thanks very much. Once upon a time  at the age of     I was a student at St. John's Medical College in Bangalore. I was a guest student during one month of a public health course. And that changed my mindset forever. The course was good  but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset. It was the brutal realization  the first morning  that the Indian students were better than me. You see  I was a study nerd. I loved statistics from a young age. And I studied very much in Sweden. I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended. But in St. John's  I was in the lower quarter. And the fact was that Indian students studied harder than we did in Sweden. They read the textbook twice  or three times or four times. In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying. And that  to me  that personal experience was the first time in my life that the mindset I grew up with was changed. And I realized that perhaps the Western world will not continue to dominate the world forever. And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience. It's that realization of someone you meet that really made you change your ideas about the world. It's not the statistics  although I tried to make it funny. And I will now  here  onstage  try to predict when that will happen    that Asia will regain its dominant position as the leading part of the world  as it used to be  over thousands of years. And I will do that by trying to predict precisely at what year the average income per person in India  in China  will reach that of the West. And I don't mean the whole economy  because to grow an economy of India to the size of U.K.    that's a piece of cake  with one billion people. But I want to see when will the average pay  the money for each person  per month  in India and China  when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States  But I will start with a historical background. And you can see my map if I get it up here. You know  I will start at     .      was a year of great technological advancement in the West. That was the year when Queen Victoria was able  for the first time  to communicate with President Buchanan  through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable. And they were the first to  Twitter  transatlantically. And I've been able  through this wonderful Google and Internet  to find the text of the telegram sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria. And it ends like this   This telegraph is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion  civilization  liberty and law throughout the world.  Those are nice words. But I got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty  and liberty for whom. And we will think about that when we look at the wider picture of the world in     . Because      was also watershed year in the history of Asia.      was the year when the courageous uprising against the foreign occupation of India was defeated by the British forces. And India was up to    years more of foreign domination.      in China was the victory in the Opium War by the British forces. And that meant that foreigners  as it said in the treaty  were allowed to trade freely in China. It meant paying with opium for Chinese goods. And      in Japan was the year when Japan had to sign the Harris Treaty and accept trade on favorable condition for the U.S. And they were threatened by those black ships there  that had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year. But  Japan  in contrast to India and China  maintained its national sovereignty. And let's see how much difference that can make. And I will do that by bringing these bubbles back to a Gapminder graph here  where you can see each bubble is a country. The size of the bubble here is the population. On this axis  as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar. And on that axis I have life expectancy  the health of people. And I also bring an innovation here. I have transformed the laser beam into an ecological  recyclable version here  in green India. And we will see  you know. Look here        India was here  China was here  Japan was there  United States and United Kingdom was richer over there. And I will start the world like this. India was not always like this level. Actually if we go back into the historical record  there was a time hundreds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even above that of Europe. But      had already been many  many years of foreign domination  and India had been de industrialized. And you can see that the countries who were growing their economy was United States and United Kingdom. And they were also  by the end of the century  getting healthy  and Japan was starting to catch up. India was trying down here. Can you see how it starts to move there  But really  really natural sovereignty was good for Japan. And Japan is trying to move up there. And it's the new century now. Health is getting better  United Kingdom  United States. But careful now    we are approaching the First World War. And the First World War  you know  we'll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here. United Kingdom is going down. And now comes the Spanish flu also. And then after the First World War  they continue up. Still under foreign domination  and without sovereignty  India and China are down in the corner. Not much has happened. They have grown their population but not much more. In the     's now  you can see that Japan is going to a period of war  with lower life expectancy. And the Second World War was really a terrible event  also economically for Japan. But they did recover quite fast afterwards. And we are moving into the new world. In      India finally gained its independence. And they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation  but in very big difficulties down there. In      we saw the emergence of the modern China in a way which surprised the world. And what happened  What happens in the after independence  You can see that the health started to improve. Children started to go to school. Health services were provided. This is the Great Leap Forward  when China fell down. It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung. China recovered. Then they said   Nevermore  stupid central planning.  But they went up here  and India was trying to follow. And they were catching up indeed. And both countries had the better health  but still a very low economy. And we came to       and Mao Tse Tung died  and a new guy turned up from the left. And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here. And he said   Doesn't matter if a cat is white or black  as long as it catches mice.  Because catching mice is what the two cats wanted to do. And you can see the two cats being here  China and India  wanting to catch the mices over there  you know. And they decided to go not only for health and education  but also starting to grow their economy. And the market reformer was successful there. In '   India follows with a market reform. And they go quite closely together  and you can see that the similarity with India and China  in many ways  are greater than the differences with them. And here they march on. And will they catch up  This is the big question today. There they are today. Now what does it mean that the    the averages there    this is the average of China. If I would split China  look here  Shanghai has already catched up. Shanghai is already there. And it's healthier than the United States. But on the other hand  Guizhou  one of the poorest inland provinces of China  is there. And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural  the rural part of Guizhou goes down there. You see this enormous inequity in China  in the midst of fast economic growth. And if I would also look at India  you have another type of inequity  actually  in India. The geographical  macro geographical difference is not so big. Uttar Pradesh  the biggest of the states here  is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India. Kerala is flying on top there  matching United States in health  but not in economy. And here  Maharashtra  with Mumbai  is forging forward. Now in India  the big inequities are within the state  rather than between the states. And that is not a bad thing  in itself. If you have a lot inequity  macro geographical inequities can be more difficult in the long term to deal with  than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center relatively close to where poor people are living. No  there is one more inequity. Look there  United States. Oh  they broke my frame. Washington  D.C. went out here. My friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this because there is a new leader in Washington who is really concerned about the health system. And I can understand him  because Washington  D.C. is so rich over there but they are not as healthy as Kerala. It's quite interesting  isn't it  I can see a business opportunity for Kerala  helping fix the health system in the United States. Now here we have the whole world. You have the legend down there. And when you see the two giant cats here  pushing forward  you see that in between them and ahead of them  is the whole emerging economies of the world  which Thomas Friedman so correctly called the  flat world.  You can see that in health and education  a large part of the world population is putting forward  but in Africa  and other parts  as in rural Guizhou in China  there is still people with low health and very low economy. We have an enormous disparity in the world. But most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast. Now  back to my projections. When will it catch up  I have to go back to very conventional graph. I will show income per person on this axis instead  poor down here  rich up there. And then time here  from      I start the world. And we shall see what will happen with these countries. You see  China under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here. Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer. And after Second World War  United States is richer than U.K. But independence is coming here. Growth is starting  economic reform. Growth is faster  and with projection from IMF you can see where you expect them to be in     . Now  the question is   When will the catch up take place   Look at  look at the United States. Can you see the bubble  The bubbles  not my bubbles  but the financial bubbles. That's the dot com bubble. This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there. You see it came down there. And it seems this is another rock coming down there  you know. So they doesn't seem to go this way  these countries. They seem to go in a more humble growth way  you know. And people interested in growth are turning their eyes towards Asia. I can compare to Japan. This is Japan coming up. You see  Japan did it like that. We add Japan to it. And there is no doubt that fast catch up can take place. Can you see here what Japan did  Japan did it like this  until full catch up  and then they follow with the other high income economies. But the real projections for those ones  I would like to give it like this. Can be worse  can be better. It's always difficult to predict  especially about the future. Now  a historian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past. I think I'm in a difficult position here. Inequalities in China and India I consider really the big obstacle because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity is what will create a domestic market  what will avoid social instability  and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population. So  social investments in health  education and infrastructure  and electricity is really what is needed in India and China. You know the climate. We have great international experts within India telling us that the climate is changing  and actions has to be taken  otherwise China and India would be the countries most to suffer from climate change. And I consider India and China the best partners in the world in a good global climate policy. But they ain't going to pay for what others  who have more money  have largely created  and I can agree on that. But what I'm really worried about is war. Will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy  and a shift of power away from where it has been the last    to     to     years  back to Asia  And will Asia be able to handle that new position of being in charge of being the most mighty  and the governors of the world  So  always avoid war  because that always pushes human beings backward. Now if these inequalities  climate and war can be avoided  get ready for a world in equity  because this is what seems to be happening. And that vision that I got as a young student        that Indians can be much better than Swedes  is just about to happen. And it will happen precisely the year      in the later part of the summer  in July  more precisely  the   th of July. The   th of July       is my    th birthday. And I expect to speak in the first session of the   th TED India. Get your bookings in time. Thank you very much. As a culture  we tell ourselves lots of stories about the future  and where we might move forward from this point. Some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us. Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling. But I want to tell you a different story here today. Like all stories  it has a beginning. My work  for a long time  has been involved in education  in teaching people practical skills for sustainability  teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food  how to build buildings using local materials  how to generate their own energy  and so on. I lived in Ireland  built the first straw bale houses in Ireland  and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing. But all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model  and moderating what comes in at one end  and moderating the outputs at the other end. And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that profoundly. And in order to introduce you to that  I've got something here that I'm going to unveil  which is one of the great marvels of the modern age. And it's something so astounding and so astonishing that I think maybe as I remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate. If you could help me with that it would be fantastic. This is a liter of oil. This bottle of oil  distilled over a hundred million years of geological time  ancient sunlight  contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor    equivalent to about    strong people coming round and working for you. We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials  medicine  modern clothing  laptops  a whole range of different things. It gives us an energy return that's unimaginable  historically. We've based the design of our settlements  our business models  our transport plans  even the idea of economic growth  some would argue  on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity. Yet  when we take a step back  and look over the span of history  at what we might call the petroleum interval  it's a short period in history where we've discovered this extraordinary material  and then based a whole way of life around it. But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain  at this stage  we move from a time where our economic success  our sense of individual prowess and well being is directly linked to how much of this we consume  to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability. And it's increasingly clear that we aren't going to be able to rely on the fact that we're going to have this at our disposal forever. For every four barrels of oil that we consume  we only discover one. And that gap continues to widen. There is also the fact that the amount of energy that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling. In the     s we got     units of energy back for every one that we put in to extract it. Completely unprecedented  historically. Already that's fallen to about   . And that's why  now  the new breakthroughs  the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta  or at the bottom of the oceans. There are    oil producing nations in the world. But of those     have already passed their peak. The moment when the world on average passes this peak  people wonder when that's going to happen. And there is an emerging case that maybe that was what happened last July when the oil prices were so high. But are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side  No. But the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are. There is also the issue of climate change  is the other thing that underpins this transition approach. But the thing that I notice  as I talk to climate scientists  is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes  as the data that's coming in  which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about. So the IPCC said that we might see significant breakup of the arctic ice in       in their worst case scenario. Actually  if current trends continue  it could all be gone in five or    years' time. If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms  it would offset all the savings that we need to make  in carbon  over the next    years to avoid runaway climate change. We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization. But I'm always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations further down the slope from us are going to tell about us.  The generation that lived at the top of the mountain  that partied so hard  and so abused its inheritance.  And one of the ways I like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil  before we had fossil fuels  and people relied on their own muscle  animal muscle energy  or a little bit of wind  little bit of water energy. We had stories like  The Seven League Boots   the giant who had these boots  where  once you put them on  with every stride you could cover seven leagues  or    miles  a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal. Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot  where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words  this pot would just make as much food as you liked  without you having to do any work  provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge. Otherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge. There is the story of  The Elves and the Shoemaker.  The people who make shoes go to sleep  wake up in the morning  and all the shoes are magically made for them. It's something that was unimaginable to people then. Now we have the seven league boots in the form of Ryanair and Easyjet. We have the magic porridge pot in the form of Walmart and Tesco. And we have the elves in the form of China. But we don't appreciate what an astonishing thing that has been. And what are the stories that we tell ourselves now  as we look forward about where we're going to go. And I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual  that the future will be like the present  just more of it. But as we've seen over the last year  I think that's an idea that is increasingly coming into question. And in terms of climate change  is something that is not actually feasible. There is the idea of hitting the wall  that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse. This is a popular story in some places. The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything  that technology can somehow get us through this completely. And it's an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks  the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis  that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints  the idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy that will mean we can sweep all concerns about energy security to one side  the idea that we can step off neatly onto a completely renewable world. But the world isn't Second Life. We can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse. And as we sit  exchanging free ideas with each other  there are still people mining coal in order to power the servers  extracting the minerals to make all of those things. The breakfast that we eat as we sit down to check our email in the morning is still transported at great distances  usually at the expense of the local  more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past  which we've so effectively devalued and dismantled. We can be astonishingly inventive and creative. But we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands. Energy and technology are not the same thing. What I'm involved with is the transition response. And this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face  and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need. It's something which has spread incredibly fast. And it is something which has several characteristics. It's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very  very quickly. It's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it. It's self organizing. There is no great central organization that pushes this  people just pick up an idea and they run with it  and they implement it where they are. It's solutions focused. It's very much looking at what people can do where they are  to respond to this. It's sensitive to place and to scale. Transitional is completely different. Transition groups in Chile  transition groups in the U.S.  transition groups here  what they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to. It learns very much from its mistakes. And it feels historic. It tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary. And it's a process which is really joyful. People have a huge amount of fun doing this  reconnecting with other people as they do it. One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience. And I think  in many ways  the idea of resilience is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability. The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology. And it's really about how systems  settlements  withstand shock from the outside. When they encounter shock from the outside that they don't just unravel and fall to pieces. And I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability  as I said. When our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them at any one time  often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in. Looking through the lens of resilience  we really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation that's so vulnerable. Resilience runs much deeper  it's about building modularity into what we do  building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us. This is a photograph of the Bristol and District Market Gardeners Association  in     . This is at a time when the city of Bristol  which is quite close to here  was surrounded by commercial market gardens  which provided a significant amount of the food that was consumed in the town  and created a lot of employment for people  as well. There was a degree of resilience  if you like  at that time  which we can now only look back on with envy. So how does this transition idea work  So basically  you have a group of people who are excited by the idea. They pick up some of the tools that we've developed. They start to run an awareness raising program looking at how this might actually work in the town. They show films  they give talks  and so on. It's a process which is playful and creative and informative. Then they start to form working groups  looking at different aspects of this  and then from that  there emerge a whole lot of projects which then the transition project itself starts to support and enable. So it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland  where I was teaching  and has since spread. There are now over     formal transition projects. And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage. They are mulling whether they're going to take it further. And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff. But what do they actually do  You know  it's a kind of nice idea  but what do they actually do on the ground  Well  I think it's really important to make the point that actually you know  this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own. We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on. We need national responses. We need local government responses. But all of those things are going to be much easier if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas and leading from the front  making unelectable policies electable  over the next   to    years. Some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects  like community supported agriculture schemes  urban food production  creating local food directories  and so on. A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies  community owned energy companies  where the community can invest money into itself  to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need. A lot of places are working with their local schools. Newent in the Forest of Dean  big polytunnel they built for the school  the kids are learning how to grow food. Promoting recycling  things like garden share  that matches up people who don't have a garden who would like to grow food  with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore. Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces. And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies. This is Lewes in Sussex  who have recently launched the Lewes Pound  a currency that you can only spend within the town  as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy. You take it anywhere else  it's not worth anything. But actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively. Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan  which is basically to develop a plan B for the town. Most of our local authorities  when they sit down to plan for the next five             years of a community  still start by assuming that there will be more energy  more cars  more housing  more jobs  more growth  and so on. What does it look like if that's not the case  And how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody  As a friend of mine says   Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for.  And that's certainly been my experience with transition. From three years ago  it just being an idea  this has become something that has virally swept around the world. We're getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband  the energy minister of this country  was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener. Which he did    and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea. There are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities  Leicestershire and Somerset. And in Stroud  the transition group there  in effect  wrote the local government's food plan. And the head of the council said   If we didn't have Transition Stroud  we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time.  As we see the spread of it  we see national hubs emerging. In Scotland  the Scottish government's climate change fund has funded Transition Scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this. And we see it all over the place as well now. But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now  but that things are already inevitably changing  and what we need to do is to work creatively with that  based on asking the right questions. I think I'd like to just return at the end to the idea of stories. Because I think stories are vital here. And actually the stories that we tell ourselves  we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here. And one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing. Stories about the community that's produced its own    pound note  for example  the school that's turned its car park into a food garden  the community that's founded its own energy company. And for me  one of the great stories recently was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House to create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done  when Eleanor Roosevelt did it  it led to the creation of    million vegetable gardens across the United States. So the question I'd like to leave you with  really  is    for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive  how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions  while also building resilience  Personally  I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil. I've been astonishingly lucky  we've been astonishingly lucky. But let us honor what it has bought us  and move forward from this point. Because if we cling to it  and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices  the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable. And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us  and that the Oil Age has done for us  we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient  more nourishing  and in which  we find ourselves fitter  more skilled and more connected to each other. Thank you very much. It's a bit funny to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen  and present my proposal to build a       kilometer long wall across the entire African continent. About the size of the Great Wall of China  this would hardly be an invisible structure. And yet it's made from parts that are invisible  or near invisible  to the naked eye  bacteria and grains of sand. Now  as architects we're trained to solve problems. But I don't really believe in architectural problems  I only believe in opportunities. Which is why I'll show you a threat  and an architectural response. The threat is desertification. My response is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidified sand  stretching across the desert. Now  sand is a magical material of beautiful contradictions. It is simple and complex. It is peaceful and violent. It is always the same  never the same  endlessly fascinating. One billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second. That's a cyclical process. As rocks and mountains die  grains of sand are born. Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone. And as the sandstone weathers  new grains break free. Some of those grains may then accumulate on a massive scale  into a sand dune. In a way  the static  stone mountain becomes a moving mountain of sand. But  moving mountains can be dangerous. Let me try and explain why. Dry areas cover more than one third of the Earth's land surfaces. Some are already deserts  others are being seriously degraded by the sand. Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel. The name means  edge of the desert.  And this is the region most closely associated with desertification. It was here in the late '  s and early '  s that major droughts brought three million people to become dependent upon emergency food aid  with about up to         dying. This is a catastrophe waiting to happen again. And it's one that gets very little attention. In our accelerated media culture  desertification is simply too slow to reach the headlines. It's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina  too few crying children and smashed up houses. And yet desertification is a major threat on all continents  affecting some     countries and about    percent of the world's agricultural drylands. It seriously threatens the livelihoods of millions of people  and especially in Africa and China. And it is largely an issue that we've created for ourselves through unsustainable use of scarce resources. So  we get climate change. We get droughts  increased desertification  crashing food systems  water scarcity  famine  forced migration  political instability  warfare  crisis. That's a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously. But  how far away is it  I went to Sokoto in northern Nigeria to try and find out how far away it is. The dunes here move southward at a pace of around     meters a year. That's the Sahara eating up almost  two meters  a day of the arable land  physically pushing people away from their homes. Here I am    I'm the second person on the left    with the elders in Gidan Kara  a tiny village outside of Sokoto. They had to move this village in      as a huge dune threatened to swallow it. So  they moved the entire village  hut by hut. This is where the village used to be. It took us about    minutes to climb up to the top of that dune  which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location. That's the kind of forced migration that desertification can lead to. If you happen to live close to the desert border  you can pretty much calculate how long it will be before you have to carry your kids away  and abandon your home and your life as you know it. Now  sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts. And still  those extreme environments are very good places if we want to stop the shifting sands. Four years ago     African countries came together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara. A fantastic project  the initial plan called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted right across the African continent  from Mauritania in the west  all the way to Djibouti in the east. If you want to stop a sand dune from moving  what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains from avalanching over its crest. And a good way of doing that  the most efficient way  is to use some kind of sand catcher. Trees or cacti are good for this. But  one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they chop them down for firewood. Now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they won't get chopped down. This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things. It adds roughness to the dune's surface  to the texture of the dune's surface  binding the grains. It provides a physical support structure for the trees  and it creates physical spaces  habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes. If people live inside of the green barrier they can help support the trees  protect them from humans  and from some of the forces of nature. Inside of the dunes we find shade. We can start harvesting condensation  and start greening the desert from within. Sand dunes are almost like ready made buildings in a way. All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid  and then excavate the sand  and we have our architecture. We can either excavate it by hand or we can have the wind excavate it for us. So  the wind carries the sand onto the site and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us. But  by now  you're probably asking  how am I planning to solidify a sand dune  How do we glue those grains of sand together  And the answer is  perhaps  that you use these guys  Bacillus pasteurii  a micro organism that is readily available in wetlands and marshes  and does precisely that. It takes a pile of loose sand and it creates sandstone out of it. These images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process. What happens is  you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand  and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains. A chemical process produces calcite  which is a kind of natural cement that binds the grains together. The whole cementation process takes about    hours. I learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong. He managed to do it in a mere       minutes. Here I am  playing the part of the mad scientist  working with the bugs at UCL in London  trying to solidify them. So  how much would this cost  I'm not an economist  very much not  but I did  quite literally  a back of the envelope calculation       and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete we would have to pay in the region of    dollars. And  after an initial cost of    bucks to buy the bacteria  which you'll never have to pay again  one cubic meter of bacterial sand would be about    dollars. How do we construct something like this  Well  I'll quickly show you two options. The first is to create a kind of balloon structure  fill it with bacteria  then allow the sand to wash over the balloon  pop the balloon  as it were  disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it. Then  a few years afterwards  using permacultural strategies  we green that part of the desert. The second alternative would be to use injection piles. So  we pushed the piles down through the dune  and we create an initial bacterial surface. We then pull the piles up through the dune and we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand with the sand acting as a mold as we go up. So  we have a way of turning sand into sandstone  and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes. But  what should they look like  Well  I was inspired  for my architectural form  by tafoni  which look a little bit like this  this is a model representation of it. These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto. And I realized that if I scaled them up  they would provide me with good spatial qualities  for ventilation  for thermal comfort  and for other things. Now  part of the formal control over this structure would be lost to nature  obviously  as the bacteria do their work. And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually. I think there is really something in that articulation that is quite nice. We see the result  the traces  if you like  of the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert into these habitable environments. Some people believe that this would spread uncontrollably  and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way. That's not true at all. It's a natural process. It goes on in nature today  and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them. So  there it is    architectural anti desertification structures made from the desert itself. Sand stopping devices  made from sand. The world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century. In a period of unprecedented population growth and increased food demands  this could prove disastrous. And quite frankly  we're putting our heads in the sand. If nothing else  I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion. But  if I had something like a TED wish  it would be to actually get it built  to start building this habitable wall  this very  very long  but very narrow city in the desert  built into the dunescape itself. It's not only something that supports trees  but something that connects people and countries together. I would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure  and leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges. Borges said that  nothing is built on stone  everything is built on sand  but we must build as if the sand were stone.  Now  there are many details left to explore in this scheme    political  practical  ethical  financial. My design  as it takes you down the rabbit hole  is fraught with many challenges and difficulties in the real world. But  it's a beginning  it's a vision. As Borges would have it  it's the sand. And I think now is really the time to turn it into stone. Thank you. One day a one eyed monkey came into the forest. Under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously. The one eyed monkey recognized the woman  a Sekhri. She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin. To watch her better  the one eyed monkey climbed onto the tree. Just then  with a loud bang  the heavens opened.  Claps  And the god Indra jumped into the clearing. Indra saw the woman  a Sekhri. Ah hah. The woman paid him no heed. So  Indra  attracted  threw her onto the floor  and proceeded to rape her. Then Indra disappeared.  Clap  Clap   And the woman's husband  the Brahmin  appeared. He realized at once what had happened. So  he petitioned the higher gods so that he may have justice. So  the god Vishnu arrived.  Are there any witnesses    Just a one eyed monkey   said the Brahmin. Now  the one eyed monkey really wanted for the woman  a Sekhri  to get justice  so she retold events exactly as they had happened. Vishnu gave his judgment.  The god Indra has sinned  in that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin. May he be called to wash away his sins.  So  Indra arrived  and performed the sacrifice of the horse. And so it transpired that a horse was killed  a god was made sin free  a Brahmin's ego was appeased  a woman ... was ruined  and a one eyed monkey was left ... very confused at what we humans call justice. In India there is a rape every three minutes. In India  only    percent of rapes come to a police station  and of these    percent that come to a police station  convictions are only in four percent of the cases. That's a lot of women who don't get justice. And it's not only about women. Look around you  look at your own countries. There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes. If you're in Australia  it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail. If you're in India  it's either Muslims or Adivasis  our tribals  the Naxalites. If you're in the U.S.  it's mostly the blacks. There is a trend here. And the Brahmins and the gods  like in my story  always get to tell their truth as The Truth. So  have we all become one eyed    two eyed instead of one eyed    monkeys  Have we stopped seeing injustice  Good morning. You know  I have told this story close to     times  in audiences in    countries  to school students  to black tie dinners at the Smithsonian  and so on and so forth  and every time it hits something. Now  if I were to go into the same crowd and say   I want to lecture you about justice and injustice   they would say   Thank you very much  we have other things to do.  And that is the astonishing power of art. Art can go through where other things can't. You can't have barriers  because it breaks through your prejudices  breaks through everything that you have as your mask  that says   I am this  I am that  I am that.  No. It breaks through those. And it reaches somewhere where other things don't. And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change  we need a language that reaches through. Hitler knew it  he used Wagner to make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan. And Mr. Berlusconi knows it  as he sits atop this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth. And all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies  and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require  they also know the power of the arts. For me it came very early. When I was a young child  my mother  who was a choreographer  came upon a phenomenon that worried her. It was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural Gujarat  because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in laws' families. And she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw. He came to talk to her and said   What is this about   She told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call Dowry Dance. Imagine a dance piece for the first inquiry into something that even today kills thousands of women. Many years later  when I was working with the director Peter Brook in  The Mahabharata  playing this feisty feminine feminist called Draupadi  I had similar experiences. Big fat black mamas in the Bronx used to come and say   Hey girl  that's it   And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say   Madame Draupadi  on n'est pas feministe  mais  a   a   And then aboriginal women in Africa would come and say   This is it   And I thought   This is what we need  as a language.  We had somebody from public health. And Devdutt also mentioned public health. Well  millions of people around the world die of waterborne disease every year. And that's because there is no clean water to drink  or in countries like India  people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation. So  what do they do  They drink the water they know is dirty  they get cholera  they get diarrhea  they get jaundice and they die. And governments have not been able to provide clean water. They try and build it. They try and build pipelines  it doesn't happen. And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford. So what do you do  Do you let them die  Well  somebody had a great idea. And it was a simple idea. It was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field. Most houses in Asia and India have a cotton garment. And it was discovered  and WHO endorses this  that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over  can reduce bacteria up to    percent from water sieved through. So  why aren't governments blaring this on television  Why isn't it on every poster across the third world  Because there is no profit in it. Because nobody can get a kickback. But it still needs to get to people. And here is one of the ways we get it to people.  Video  Woman  Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers. Man  You know how expensive those are. I have a solution that requires neither machine  nor wood  nor cooking gas. Woman  What solution  Man  Listen  go fetch that cotton sari you have. Boy  Grand dad  tell me the solution please. Man  I will tell all of you. Just wait. Woman  Here father.  Man  Is it clean   Woman  Yes  of course. Man  Then do as I tell you. Fold the sari into eight folds. Woman  All right  father. Man  And you  you count that she does it right.  Boy  All right  grand dad.  Man  One  two  three  four folds we make. All the germs from the water we take. Chorus  One  two  three  four folds we make. All the germs from the water we take. Five  six  seven  eight folds we make. Our drinking water safe we make. Five  six  seven  eight folds we make. Our drinking water safe we make. Woman  Here  father  your eight times folded cotton sari. Man  So this is the cotton sari. And through this we will have clean water. I think it's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives. While universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution  and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders  we are surrounded by violence  whether it's road rage  or whether it's domestic violence  whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her because she hasn't done her homework  it's everywhere. So  why are we not doing something to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis  What are we doing to try and make children and young people realize that violence is something that we indulge in  that we can stop  and that there are other ways of actually taking violence  taking anger  taking frustrations into different things that do not harm other people. Well  here is one such way. Your parents were peaceful people. Your grandparents were peaceful people. So much peace in one place  How could it be otherwise  But  what if ... Yes. What if ... One little gene in you has been trying to get through  From your beginnings in Africa  through each generation  may be passed on to you  in your creation. It's a secret urge  hiding deep in you. And if it's in you  then it's in me too. Oh  dear. It's what made you smack your baby brother  stamp on a cockroach  scratch your mother. It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside  when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide. Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work  and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk. Oh  dear. And as for outsiders  white  black or brown  tar and feather them  and whip them out of town. It's that little gene. It's small and it's mean. Too small for detection  it's your built in protection. Adrenaline  kill. It'll give you the will. Yes  you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it. You're V I O L E N T. Cause you're either a victim  or on top  like me. Goodbye  Abraham Lincoln. Goodbye  Mahatma Gandhi. Goodbye  Martin Luther King. Hello  gangs from this neighborhood killing gangs from that neighborhood. Hello governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who can't even afford to give them food. Hello civilization. Hello    st century. Look what we've ... look what they've done. Mainstream art  cinema  has been used across the world to talk about social issues. A few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti  which suddenly spawned thousands of young people wanting to volunteer for social change. In Venezuela  one of the most popular soap operas has a heroine called Crystal. And when  onscreen  Crystal got breast cancer         more young women went to have mammographies done. And of course   The Vagina Monologues  we know about. And there are stand up comics who are talking about racial issues  about ethnic issues. So  why is it  that if we think that we all agree that we need a better world  we need a more just world  why is it that we are not using the one language that has consistently showed us that we can break down barriers  that we can reach people  What I need to say to the planners of the world  the governments  the strategists is   You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake. It needs to be the yeast.  Because  any future planning  if      is when we want to get there  unless the arts are put with the scientists  with the economists  with all those who prepare for the future  badly  we're not going to get there. And unless this is actually internalized  it won't happen. So  what is it that we require  What is it that we need  We need to break down our vision of what planners are  of what the correct way of a path is. And to say all these years of trying to make a better world  and we have failed. There are more people being raped. There are more wars. There are more people dying of simple things. So  something has got to give. And that is what I want. Can I have my last audio track please  Once there was a princess who whistled beautifully. Her father the king said   Don't whistle.  Her mother the queen said   Hai  don't whistle.  But the princess continued whistling. The years went by and the princess grew up into a beautiful young woman  who whistled even more beautifully. Her father the king said   Who will marry a whistling princess   Her mother the queen said   Who will marry a whistling princess   But the king had an idea. He announced a Swayamvara. He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.  Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom and her hand in marriage   Soon the palace filled with princes whistling. Some whistled badly. Some whistled well. But nobody could defeat the princess.  Now what shall we do   said the king.  Now what shall we do   said the queen. But the princess said   Father  Mother  don't worry. I have an idea. I am going to go to each of these young men and I am going to ask them if they defeated correctly. And if somebody answers  that shall be my wish.  So she went up to each and said   Do you accept that I have defeated you   And they said   Me  Defeated by a woman  No way  that's impossible  No no no no no  That's not possible.  Till finally one prince said   Princess  I accept  you have defeated me.   Uh huh ...  she said.  Father  mother  this man shall be my wife.  Thank you. As an Indian  and now as a politician and a government minister  I've become rather concerned about the hype we're hearing about our own country  all this talk about India becoming a world leader  even the next superpower. In fact  the American publishers of my book   The Elephant  The Tiger and the Cell Phone   added a gratuitous subtitle saying   India  The next   st century power.  And I just don't think that's what India's all about  or should be all about. Indeed  what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic. It's redolent of James Bond movies and Kipling ballads. After all  what constitutes a world leader  If it's population  we're on course to top the charts. We will overtake China by     . Is it military strength  Well  we have the world's fourth largest army. Is it nuclear capacity  We know we have that. The Americans have even recognized it  in an agreement. Is it the economy  Well  we have now the fifth largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms. And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year  we grew at  .  percent. But  somehow  none of that adds up to me  to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world  in this part of the   st century. And so I wondered  could what the future beckons for India to be all about be a combination of these things allied to something else  the power of example  the attraction of India's culture  what  in other words  people like to call  soft power.  Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic  Joseph Nye  a friend of mine. And  very simply  and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here  it's essentially the ability of a country to attract others because of its culture  its political values  its foreign policies. And  you know  lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States  but we know the Alliance Francaise is all about French soft power  the British Council. The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power. Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships. But  the fact is  in fact  that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds have done more for American soft power around the world than any specifically government activity. So soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments  but partly despite governments. And in the information era we all live in today  what we might call the TED age  I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that's been fed on an incessant diet of Internet news  of televised images  of cellphone videos  of email gossip. In other words  all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries  whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories. Now  in this age  again  countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information have a particular advantage. And of course they have more influence  sometimes  about how they're seen. India has more all news TV channels than any country in the world  in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together. But  the fact still is that it's not just that. In order to have soft power  you have to be connected. One might argue that India has become an astonishingly connected country. I think you've already heard the figures. We've been selling    million cellphones a month. Currently there are     million cellphones in Indian hands  in India. And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market. In fact  those    million cellphones are the most connections that any country  including the U.S. and China  has ever established in the history of telecommunications. But  what perhaps some of you don't realize is how far we've come to get there. You know  when I grew up in India  telephones were a rarity. In fact  they were so rare that elected members of Parliament had the right to allocate    telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed worthy. If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist  or a doctor or something  you might have a telephone. But sometimes it just sat there. I went to high school in Calcutta. And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer. But half the time we would pick it up with an expectant look on our faces  there would be no dial tone. If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number  the odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach. In fact the words  wrong number  were more popular than the word  Hello.  If you then wanted to connect to another city  let's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi  you'd have to book something called a trunk call  and then sit by the phone all day  waiting for it to come through. Or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call. But  lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days  so  it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through. In fact  so woeful was our telephone service that a Member of Parliament stood up in      and complained about this. And the Then Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury  not a right  that the government had no obligation to provide better service  and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone  could he please return it  since there was an eight year long waiting list for telephones in India. Now  fast forward to today and this is what you see  the    million cell phones a month. But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones. You know  if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi  on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart that looks like it was designed in the   th century  wielding a coal fired steam iron that might have been invented in the   th century. He's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a   st century instrument. He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free  and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood  to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed. The other day I was in Kerala  my home state  at the country farm of a friend  about    kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban. And it was a hot day and he said   Hey  would you like some fresh coconut water   And it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics  so I said sure. And he whipped out his cellphone  dialed the number  and a voice said   I'm up here.  And right on top of the nearest coconut tree  with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other  was a local toddy tapper  who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink. Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones. When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast to find out where they get the best possible prices. Farmers now  who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor to find out if the market town was open  if the market was on  whether the product they'd harvested could be sold  what price they'd fetch. They'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge to the market town to get that information and come back  then they'd load the cart. Today they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call. So this empowerment of the underclass is the real result of India being connected. And that transformation is part of where India is heading today. But  of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading. You've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized in the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump    Mr. Shekhar Kapur  forgive me    and they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio. And the first goat  chewing away  says   You know  this film is not bad.  And the second goat says   No  the book was better.  I usually tend to think that the book is usually better  but  having said that  the fact is that Bollywood is now taking a certain aspect of Indian ness and Indian culture around the globe  not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K.  but to the screens of Arabs and Africans  of Senegalese and Syrians. I've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother in a village in Senegal takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar  just to watch a Bollywood movie. She can't understand the dialogue. She's illiterate  so she can't read the French subtitles. But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps  and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action. She goes away with stars in her eyes about India  as a result. And this is happening more and more. Afghanistan  we know what a serious security problem Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world. India doesn't have a military mission there. You know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years  One simple fact  you couldn't try to call an Afghan at      in the evening. Why  Because that was the moment when the Indian television soap opera   Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi   dubbed into Dari  was telecast on Tolo T.V. And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history. Every Afghan family wanted to watch it. They had to suspend functions at     . Weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the T.V. set  and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom. Crime went up at     . I have read a Reuters dispatch    so this is not Indian propaganda  a British news agency    about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif  stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers  its hubcaps  its sideview mirrors  any moving part they could find  at       because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store. And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine   Tulsi Zindabad    Long live Tulsi.  That's soft power. And that is what India is developing through the  E  part of TED  its own entertainment industry. The same is true  of course    we don't have time for too many more examples    but it's true of our music  of our dance  of our art  yoga  ayurveda  even Indian cuisine. I mean  the proliferation of Indian restaurants since I first went abroad as a student  in the mid '  s  and what I see today  you can't go to a mid size town in Europe or North America and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one. But  today in Britain  for example  Indian restaurants in Britain employ more people than the coal mining  ship building and iron and steel industries combined. So the empire can strike back. But  with this increasing awareness of India  with you and with I  and so on  with tales like Afghanistan  comes something vital in the information era  the sense that in today's world it's not the side of the bigger army that wins  it's the country that tells a better story that prevails. And India is  and must remain  in my view  the land of the better story. Stereotypes are changing. I mean  again  having gone to the U.S. as a student in the mid '  s  I knew what the image of India was then  if there was an image at all. Today  people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere speak of the IITs  the Indian Institutes of Technology with the same reverence they used to accord to MIT. This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK. I had a friend  a history major like me  who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam  by an anxiously perspiring European saying   You're Indian  you're Indian  Can you help me fix my laptop   We've gone from the image of India as land of fakirs lying on beds of nails  and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick  to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses  computer wizards  software gurus. But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world. But  there is something more substantive to that. The story rests on a fundamental platform of political pluralism. It's a civilizational story to begin with. Because India has been an open society for millennia. India gave refuge to the Jews  fleeing the destruction of the first temple by the Babylonians  and said thereafter by the Romans. In fact  legend has is that when Doubting Thomas  the Apostle  Saint Thomas  landed on the shores of Kerala  my home state  somewhere around    A.D.  he was welcomed on shore by a flute playing Jewish girl. And to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora in the history of the Jewish people  which has never encountered a single incident of anti semitism. That's the Indian story. Islam came peacefully to the south  slightly more differently complicated history in the north. But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India. You know  we just celebrated  this year  our general elections  the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history. And the next one will be even bigger  because our voting population keeps growing by    million a year. But  the fact is that the last elections  five years ago  gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith  Sonia Gandhi  who then made way for a Sikh  Mohan Singh  to be sworn in as Prime Minister by a Muslim  President Abdul Kalam  in a country    percent Hindu. This is India  and of course it's all the more striking because it was four years later that we all applauded the U.S.  the oldest democracy in the modern world  more than     years of free and fair elections  which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president who wasn't white  male or Christian. So  maybe    oh sorry  he is Christian  I beg your pardon    and he is male  but he isn't white. All the others have been all those three. All his predecessors have been all those three  and that's the point I was trying to make. But  the issue is that when I talked about that example  it's not just about talking about India  it's not propaganda. Because ultimately  that electoral outcome had nothing to do with the rest of the world. It was essentially India being itself. And ultimately  it seems to me  that always works better than propaganda. Governments aren't very good at telling stories. But people see a society for what it is  and that  it seems to me  is what ultimately will make a difference in today's information era  in today's TED age. So India now is no longer the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion  because we have every ethnicity known to mankind  practically  we've every religion know to mankind  with the possible exception of Shintoism  though that has some Hindu elements somewhere. We have    official languages that are recognized in our Constitution. And those of you who cashed your money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the rupee note  spelling out the denominations. We've got all of that. We don't even have geography uniting us  because the natural geography of the subcontinent framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked by the partition with Pakistan in     . In fact  you can't even take the name of the country for granted  because the name  India  comes from the river Indus  which flows in Pakistan. But  the whole point is that India is the nationalism of an idea. It's the idea of an ever ever land  emerging from an ancient civilization  united by a shared history  but sustained  above all  by pluralist democracy. That is a   st century story as well as an ancient one. And it's the nationalism of an idea that essentially says you can endure differences of caste  creed  color  culture  cuisine  custom and costume  consonant  for that matter  and still rally around a consensus. And the consensus is of a very simple principle  that in a diverse plural democracy like India you don't really have to agree on everything all the time  so long as you agree on the ground rules of how you will disagree. The great success story of India  a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate  in the '  s and '  s  is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus. Now  that is the India that is emerging into the   st century. And I do want to make the point that if there is anything worth celebrating about India  it isn't military muscle  economic power. All of that is necessary  but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome. Somebody said we are super poor  and we are also super power. We can't really be both of those. We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the hardware of development  the ports  the roads  the airports  all the infrastructural things we need to do  and the software of development  the human capital  the need for the ordinary person in India to be able to have a couple of square meals a day  to be able to send his or her children to a decent school  and to aspire to work a job that will give them opportunities in their lives that can transform themselves. But  it's all taking place  this great adventure of conquering those challenges  those real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist. But  it's all taking place in an open society  in a rich and diverse and plural civilization  in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill the creative energies of its people. That's why India belongs at TED  and that's why TED belongs in India. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Thank you so much  Prime Minister  that was both fascinating and quite inspiring. So  you're calling for a global ethic. Would you describe that as global citizenship  Is that an idea that you believe in  and how would you define that  Gordon Brown  It is about global citizenship and recognizing our responsibilities to others. There is so much to do over the next few years that is obvious to so many of us to build a better world. And there is so much shared sense of what we need to do  that it is vital that we all come together. But we don't necessarily have the means to do so. So there are challenges to be met. I believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents. But of course the task is to create the institutions that make that global society work. But I don't think we should underestimate the extent to which massive changes in technology make possible the linking up of people across the world. CA  But people get excited about this idea of global citizenship  but then they get confused a bit again when they start thinking about patriotism  and how to combine these two. I mean  you're elected as Prime Minister with a brief to bat for Britain. How do you reconcile the two things  GB  Well  of course national identity remains important. But it's not at the expense of people accepting their global responsibilities. And I think one of the problems of recession is that people become more protectionist  they look in on themselves  they try to protect their own nation  perhaps at the expense of other nations. When you actually look at the motor of the world economy  it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries. And any nation that would become protectionist over the next few years would deprive itself of the chance of getting the benefits of growth in the world economy. So  you've got to have a healthy sense of patriotism  that's absolutely important. But you've got to realize that this world has changed fundamentally  and the problems we have cannot be solved by one nation and one nation alone. CA  Well  indeed. But what do you do when the two come into conflict and you're forced to make a decision that either is in Britain's interest  or the interest of Britons  or citizens elsewhere in the world  GB  Well I think we can persuade people that what is necessary for Britain's long term interests  what is necessary for America's long term interests  is proper engagement with the rest of the world  and taking the action that is necessary. There is a great story  again  told about Richard Nixon.       Ghana becomes independent  so it is just over    years ago. Richard Nixon goes to represent the United States government at the celebrations for independence in Ghana. And it's one of his first outings as Vice President to an African country. He doesn't quite know what to do  so he starts going around the crowd and starts talking to people and he says to people in this rather unique way   How does it feel to be free   And he's going around   How does it feel to be free    How does it feel to be free   And then someone says   How should I know  I come from Alabama.  And that was the     s. Now  what is remarkable is that civil rights in America were achieved in the     s. But what is equally remarkable is socioeconomic rights in Africa have not moved forward very fast even since the age of colonialism. And yet  America and Africa have got a common interest. And we have got to realize that if we don't link up with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in Africa  to work together for common causes  then the danger of Al Qaeda and related groups making progress in Africa is very big. So  I would say that what seems sometimes to be altruism  in relation to Africa  or in relation to developing countries  is more than that. It is enlightened self interest for us to work with other countries. And I would say that national interest and  if you like  what is the global interest to tackle poverty and climate change do  in the long run  come together. And whatever the short run price for taking action on climate change or on security  or taking action to provide opportunities for people for education  these are prices that are worth paying so that you build a stronger global society where people feel able to feel comfortable with each other and are able to communicate with each other in such a way that you can actually build stronger links between different countries. CA  I still just want to draw out on this issue. So  you're on vacation at a nice beach  and word comes through that there's been a massive earthquake and that there is a tsunami advancing on the beach. One end of the beach  there is a house containing a family of five Nigerians. And at the other end of the beach there is a single Brit. You have time to    you have time to alert one house. What do you do  GB  Modern communications. Alert both. I do agree that my responsibility is first of all to make sure that people in our country are safe. And I wouldn't like anything that is said today to suggest that I am diminishing the importance of the responsibility that each leader has for their own country. But I'm trying to suggest that there is a huge opportunity open to us that was never open to us before. But the power to communicate across borders allows us to organize the world in a different way. And I think  look at the tsunami  it's a classic example. Where was the early warning systems  Where was the world acting together to deal with the problems that they knew arose from the potential for earthquakes  as well as the potential for climate change  And when the world starts to work together  with better early warning systems  you can deal with some of these problems in a better way. I just think we're not seeing  at the moment  the huge opportunities open to us by the ability of people to cooperate in a world where either there was isolationism before or there was limited alliances based on convenience which never actually took you to deal with some of the central problems. CA  But I think this is the frustration that perhaps a lot of people have  like people in the audience here  where we love the kind of language that you're talking about. It is inspiring. A lot of us believe that that has to be the world's future. And yet  when the situation changes  you suddenly hear politicians talking as if  you know  for example  the life of one American soldier is worth countless numbers of Iraqi civilians. When the pedal hits the metal  the idealism can get moved away. I'm just wondering whether you can see that changing over time  whether you see in Britain that there are changing attitudes  and that people are actually more supportive of the kind of global ethic that you talk about. GB  I think every religion  every faith  and I'm not just talking here to people of faith or religion    it has this global ethic at the center of its credo. And whether it's Jewish or whether it's Muslim or whether it's Hindu  or whether it's Sikh  the same global ethic is at the heart of each of these religions. So  I think you're dealing with something that people instinctively see as part of their moral sense. So you're building on something that is not pure self interest. You're building on people's ideas and values    that perhaps they're candles that burn very dimly on certain occasions. But it is a set of values that cannot  in my view  be extinguished. Then the question is  how do you make that change happen  How do you persuade people that it is in their interest to build strong    After the Second World War  we built institutions  the United Nations  the IMF  the World Bank  the World Trade Organization  the Marshall Plan. There was a period in which people talked about an act of creation  because these institutions were so new. But they are now out of date. They don't deal with the problems. You can't deal with the environmental problem through existing institutions. You can't deal with the security problem in the way that you need to. You can't deal with the economic and financial problem. So we have got to rebuild our global institutions  build them in a way that is suitable to the challenges of this time. And I believe that if you look at the biggest challenge we face  it is to persuade people to have the confidence that we can build a truly global society with the institutions that are founded on these rules. So  I come back to my initial point. Sometimes you think things are impossible. Nobody would have said    years ago that apartheid would have gone in       or that the Berlin wall would have fallen at the turn of the '  s and '  s  or that polio could be eradicated  or perhaps    years ago  nobody would have said a man could gone to the Moon. All these things have happened. By tackling the impossible  you make the impossible possible. CA  And we have had a speaker who said that very thing  and swallowed a sword right after that  which was quite dramatic. GB  Followed my sword and swallow. CA  But  surely a true global ethic is for someone to say   I believe that the life of every human on the planet is worth the same  equal consideration  regardless of nationality and religion.  And you have politicians who have    you're elected. In a way  you can't say that. Even if  as a human being  you believe that  you can't say that. You're elected for Britain's interests. GB  We have a responsibility to protect. I mean look        the Treaty of Versailles  and all the treaties before that  the Treaty of Westphalia and everything else  were about protecting the sovereign right of countries to do what they want. Since then  the world has moved forward  partly as a result of what happened with the Holocaust  and people's concern about the rights of individuals within territories where they need protection  partly because of what we saw in Rwanda  partly because of what we saw in Bosnia. The idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk is now being established as a principle which governs the world. So  while I can't automatically say that Britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country  in danger  I can say that Britain is in a position where we're working with other countries so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack  is something that is accepted by the whole world. Now  in the end  that can only be achieved if your international institutions work well enough to be able to do so. And that comes back to what the future role of the United Nations  and what it can do  actually is. But  the responsibility to protect is a new idea that is  in a sense  taken over from the idea of self determination as the principle governing the international community. CA  Can you picture  in our lifetimes  a politician ever going out on a platform of the kind of full form global ethic  global citizenship  And basically saying   I believe that all people across the planet have equal consideration  and if in power we will act in that way. And we believe that the people of this country are also now global citizens and will support that ethic.  GB  Is that not what we're doing in the debate about climate change  We're saying that you cannot solve the problem of climate change in one country  you've got to involve all countries. You're saying that you must  and you have a duty to help those countries that cannot afford to deal with the problems of climate change themselves. You're saying you want a deal with all the different countries of the world where we're all bound together to cutting carbon emissions in a way that is to the benefit of the whole world. We've never had this before because Kyoto didn't work. If you could get a deal at Copenhagen  where people agreed  A  that there was a long term target for carbon emission cuts  B  that there was short range targets that had to be met so this wasn't just abstract  it was people actually making decisions now that would make a difference now  and if you could then find a financing mechanism that meant that the poorest countries that had been hurt by our inability to deal with climate change over many  many years and decades are given special help so that they can move to energy efficient technologies  and they are in a position financially to be able to afford the long term investment that is associated with cutting carbon emissions  then you are treating the world equally  by giving consideration to every part of the planet and the needs they have. It doesn't mean that everybody does exactly the same thing  because we've actually got to do more financially to help the poorest countries  but it does mean there is equal consideration for the needs of citizens in a single planet. CA  Yes. And then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries fighting over their own individual interests. GB  Yes  but I think Europe has got a position  which is    countries have already come together. I mean  the great difficulty in Europe is if you're at a meeting and    people speak  it takes a very  very long time. But we did get an agreement on climate change. America has made its first disposition on this with the bill that President Obama should be congratulated for getting through Congress. Japan has made an announcement. China and India have signed up to the scientific evidence. And now we've got to move them to accept a long term target  and then short term targets. But more progress has been made  I think  in the last few weeks than had been made for some years. And I do believe that there is a strong possibility that if we work together  we can get that agreement to Copenhagen. I certainly have been putting forward proposals that would have allowed the poorest parts of the world to feel that we have taken into account their specific needs. And we would help them adapt. And we would help them make the transition to a low carbon economy. I do think a reform of the international institutions is vital to this. When the IMF was created in the     s  it was created with resources that were five percent or so of the world's GDP. The IMF now has limited resources  one percent. It can't really make the difference that ought to be made in a period of crisis. So  we've got to rebuild the world institutions. And that's a big task  persuading all the different countries with the different voting shares in these institutions to do so. There is a story told about the three world leaders of the day getting a chance to get some advice from God. And the story is told that Bill Clinton went to God and he asked when there will be successful climate change and a low carbon economy. And God shook his head and said   Not this year  not this decade  perhaps not even in  your  lifetime.  And Bill Clinton walked away in tears because he had failed to get what he wanted. And then the story is that Barroso  the president of the European Commission  went to God and he asked   When will we get a recovery of global growth   And God said   Not this year  not in this decade  perhaps not in your lifetime.  So Barroso walked away crying and in tears. And then the Secretary General of the United Nations came up to speak to God and said   When will our international institutions work   And God cried. It is very important to recognize that this reform of institutions is the next stage after agreeing upon ourselves that there is a clear ethic upon which we can build. CA  Prime Minister  I think there are many in the audience who are truly appreciative of the efforts you made in terms of the financial mess we got ourselves into. And there are certainly many people in the audience who will be cheering you on as you seek to advance this global ethic. Thank you so much for coming to TED. GB  Well  thank you. How do you observe something you can't see  This is the basic question of somebody who's interested in finding and studying black holes. Because black holes are objects whose pull of gravity is so intense that nothing can escape it  not even light  so you can't see it directly. So  my story today about black holes is about one particular black hole. I'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive  what we like to call  supermassive  black hole at the center of our galaxy. And the reason this is interesting is that it gives us an opportunity to prove whether or not these exotic objects really exist. And second  it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment  and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in. So  to begin with  we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the proof of a black hole. So  what is a black hole  Well  in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object  because there are only three characteristics that you can describe  the mass  the spin  and the charge. And I'm going to only talk about the mass. So  in that sense  it's a very simple object. But in another sense  it's an incredibly complicated object that we need relatively exotic physics to describe  and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding of the universe. But today  the way I want you to understand a black hole  for the proof of a black hole  is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume. So  despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about an object that's supermassive  and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment  it has no finite size. So  this is a little tricky. But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see  and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius. And that's named after the guy who recognized why it was such an important radius. This is a virtual radius  not reality  the black hole has no size. So why is it so important  It's important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole. That means you  your neighbor  your cellphone  the auditorium can become a black hole if you can figure out how to compress it down to the size of the Schwarzschild radius. At that point  what's going to happen  At that point gravity wins. Gravity wins over all other known forces. And the object is forced to continue to collapse to an infinitely small object. And then it's a black hole. So  if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube  it would become a black hole  because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius. Now  the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is. And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out. It depends only on the mass of the object. Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii. Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii. So  if I were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford  it would become a black hole. So  now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is. And it's actually quite a useful concept  because it tells us not only when a black hole will form  but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole. I only need two things. I need to understand the mass of the object I'm claiming is a black hole  and what its Schwarzschild radius is. And since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius  there is actually only one thing I really need to know. So  my job in convincing you that there is a black hole is to show that there is some object that's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius. And your job today is to be skeptical. Okay  so  I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole  I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes. So  I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is  as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole. An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star's life. So  if a star starts its life off with much more mass than the mass of the Sun  it's going to end its life by exploding and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here. And inside that supernova remnant is going to be a little black hole that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun. On an astronomical scale that's a very small black hole. Now  what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes. And the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies. And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes. There are big ones. There are little ones. Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy. And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left. And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy  just to give you a sense of scale. And all the light that we see from a typical galaxy  which is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here  comes from the light from the stars. So  we see the galaxy because of the star light. Now  there are a few relatively exotic galaxies. I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world  because they are kind of show offs. And we call them active galactic nuclei. And we call them that because their nucleus  or their center  are very active. So  at the center there  that's actually where most of the starlight comes out from. And yet  what we actually see is light that can't be explained by the starlight. It's way more energetic. In fact  in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here. There are also jets emanating out from the center. Again  a source of energy that's very difficult to explain if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars. So  what people have thought is that perhaps there are supermassive black holes which matter is falling on to. So  you can't see the black hole itself  but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light we see. So  there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes exist at the center of galaxies. But it's a kind of indirect argument. Nonetheless  it's given rise to the notion that maybe it's not just these prima donnas that have these supermassive black holes  but rather all galaxies might harbor these supermassive black holes at their centers. And if that's the case    and this is an example of a normal galaxy  what we see is the star light. And if there is a supermassive black hole  what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet. Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see in active galactic nuclei. If we're going to look for these stealth black holes at the center of galaxies  the best place to look is in our own galaxy  our Milky Way. And this is a wide field picture taken of the center of the Milky Way. And what we see is a line of stars. And that is because we live in a galaxy which has a flattened  disk like structure. And we live in the middle of it  so when we look towards the center  we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy  or line that defines the plane of the galaxy. Now  the advantage of studying our own galaxy is it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy that we're ever going to have  because the next closest galaxy is     times further away. So  we can see far more detail in our galaxy than anyplace else. And as you'll see in a moment  the ability to see detail is key to this experiment. So  how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass inside a small volume  Which is the job that I have to show you today. And the tool that we use is to watch the way stars orbit the black hole. Stars will orbit the black hole in the very same way that planets orbit the sun. It's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit. If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off  or at least go at a much slower rate because all that determines how they go around is how much mass is inside its orbit. So  this is great  because remember my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume. So  if I know how fast it goes around  I know the mass. And if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius. So  I want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible. Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible. So  this means that I want to see a lot of detail. And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used the world's largest telescope. This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes with a mirror    meters  which is roughly the diameter of a tennis court. Now  this is wonderful  because the campaign promise of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope  the smaller the detail that we can see. But it turns out these telescopes  or any telescope on the ground has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise. And that is because of the atmosphere. Atmosphere is great for us  it allows us to survive here on Earth. But it's relatively challenging for astronomers who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources. So  to give you a sense of what this is like  it's actually like looking at a pebble at the bottom of a stream. Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream  the stream is continuously moving and turbulent  and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream. Very much in the same way  it's very difficult to see astronomical sources  because of the atmosphere that's continuously moving by. So  I've spent a lot of my career working on ways to correct for the atmosphere  to give us a cleaner view. And that buys us about a factor of   . And I think all of you can agree that if you can figure out how to improve life by a factor of     you've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot  say your salary  you'd notice  or your kids  you'd notice. And this animation here shows you one example of the techniques that we use  called adaptive optics. You're seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique    in other words  just a picture that shows the stars    and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy  where we think the black hole is. So  without this technology you can't see the stars. With this technology all of a sudden you can see it. This technology works by introducing a mirror into the telescope optics system that's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you. So  it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope. Now  in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on that little square there. So  we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square  although we've looked at all of them. So  I want to see how these things have moved. And over the course of this experiment  these stars have moved a tremendous amount. So  we've been doing this experiment for    years  and we see the stars go all the way around. Now  most astronomers have a favorite star  and mine today is a star that's labeled up there  SO  . Absolutely my favorite star in the world. And that's because it goes around in only    years. And to give you a sense of how short that is  the sun takes     million years to go around the center of the galaxy. Stars that we knew about before  that were as close to the center of the galaxy as possible  take     years. And this one  this one goes around in a human lifetime. That's kind of profound  in a way. But it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me how much mass is inside a very small radius. So  next we see a picture here that shows you before this experiment the size to which we could confine the mass of the center of the galaxy. What we knew before is that there was four million times the mass of the sun inside that circle. And as you can see  there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle. You can see a lot of stars. So  there was actually lots of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy  because you could put a lot of stuff in there. But with this experiment  we've confined that same mass to a much smaller volume that's        times smaller. And because of that  we've been able to show that there is a supermassive black hole there. To give you a sense of how small that size is  that's the size of our solar system. So  we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume. Now  truth in advertising. Right  I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius. And the truth is  I'm not quite there. But we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass. And  in fact  it's the best evidence we have to date for not only existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy  but any in our universe. So  what next  I actually think this is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology  so let's move on with the problem. So  what I want to tell you  very briefly  is a few examples of the excitement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy  now that we know that there is  or at least we believe  that there is a supermassive black hole there. And the fun phase of this experiment is  while we've tested some of our ideas about the consequences of a supermassive black hole being at the center of our galaxy  almost every single one has been inconsistent with what we actually see. And that's the fun. So  let me give you the two examples. You can ask   What do you expect for the old stars  stars that have been around the center of the galaxy for a long time  they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole.  What you expect there is that old stars should be very clustered around the black hole. You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole. Likewise  for the young stars  or in contrast  the young stars  they just should not be there. A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery. To get a star to form  you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse. And it's a very fragile entity. And what does the big black hole do  It strips that gas cloud apart. It pulls much stronger on one side than the other and the cloud is stripped apart. In fact  we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment. So  you shouldn't see young stars. So  what do we see  Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today  we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young. The old ones are red. The young ones are blue. And the yellow ones  we don't know yet. So  you can already see the surprise. There is a dearth of old stars. There is an abundance of young stars  so it's the exact opposite of the prediction. So  this is the fun part. And in fact  today  this is what we're trying to figure out  this mystery of how do you get    how do you resolve this contradiction. So  in fact  my graduate students are  at this very moment  today  at the telescope  in Hawaii  making observations to get us hopefully to the next stage  where we can address this question of why are there so many young stars  and so few old stars. To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away. To do that we'll probably need much more sophisticated technology than we have today. Because  in truth  while I said we're correcting for the Earth's atmosphere  we actually only correct for half the errors that are introduced. We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere  and what we think we can do is if we shine a few more that we can correct the rest. So this is what we hope to do in the next few years. And on a much longer time scale  what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes  because  remember  bigger is better in astronomy. So  we want to build a    meter telescope. And with this telescope we should be able to see stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy. And we hope to be able to test some of Einstein's theories of general relativity  some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form. So  we think the future of this experiment is quite exciting. So  in conclusion  I'm going to show you an animation that basically shows you how these orbits have been moving  in three dimensions. And I hope  if nothing else  I've convinced you that  one  we do in fact have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. And this means that these things do exist in our universe  and we have to contend with this  we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world. Second  we've been able to look at that interaction of how supermassive black holes interact  and understand  maybe  the role in which they play in shaping what galaxies are  and how they work. And last but not least  none of this would have happened without the advent of the tremendous progress that's been made on the technology front. And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast  and holds a lot in store for the future. Thanks very much. For emotions  we should not move quickly to the desert. So  first  a small housekeeping announcement  please switch off your proper English check programs installed in your brain. So  welcome to the Golden Desert  Indian desert. It receives the least rainfall in the country  lowest rainfall. If you are well versed with inches  nine inches  centimeters      centimeters . The groundwater is     feet deep      meters. And in most parts it is saline  not fit for drinking. So  you can't install hand pumps or dig wells  though there is no electricity in most of the villages. But suppose you use the green technology  solar pumps    they are of no use in this area. So  welcome to the Golden Desert. Clouds seldom visit this area. But we find    different names of clouds in this dialect used here. There are a number of techniques to harvest rain. This is a new work  it's a new program. But for the desert society this is no program  this is their life. And they harvest rain in many ways. So  this is the first device they use in harvesting rain. It's called kunds  somewhere it is called  unclear . And you can notice they have created a kind of false catchment. The desert is there  sand dunes  some small field. And this is all big raised platform. You can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment  and there is a slope. Sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms  but here they will care properly. And the water will go where it should go. And then it is    feet deep. The waterproofing is done perfectly  better than our city contractors  because not a single drop should go waste in this. They collect     thousand liters in one season. And this is pure drinking water. Below the surface there is hard saline water. But now you can have this for year round. It's two houses. We often use a term called bylaws. Because we are used to get written things. But here it is unwritten by law. And people made their house  and the water storage tanks. These raised up platforms just like this stage. In fact they go    feet deep  and collect rain water from roof  there is a small pipe  and from their courtyard. It can also harvest something like        in a good monsoon. Another big one  this is of course out of the hardcore desert area. This is near Jaipur. This is called the Jaigarh Fort. And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season. The age is     years. So  since     years it has been giving you almost six million gallons of water per season. You can calculate the price of that water. It draws water from    kilometers of canals. You can see a modern road  hardly    years old. It can break sometimes. But this     year old canal  which draws water  it is maintained for so many generations. Of course if you want to go inside  the two doors are locked. But they can be opened for TED people. And we request them. You can see person coming up with two canisters of water. And the water level    these are not empty canisters    water level is right up to this. It can envy many municipalities  the color  the taste  the purity of this water. And this is what they call Zero B type of water  because it comes from the clouds  pure distilled water. We stop for a quick commercial break  and then we come back to the traditional systems. The government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi million dollar project to bring water from the Himalayas. That's why I said that this is a commercial break. But we will come back  once again  to the traditional thing. So  water from          kilometers away  soon it become like this. In many portions  water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything. Of course there are some areas where water is reaching  I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all. But the tail end  the Jaisalmer area  you will notice in Bikaner things like this  where the water hyacinth couldn't grow  the sand is flowing in these canals. The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it. We had full page advertisements  some    years     years ago when this canal came. They said that throw away your traditional systems  these new cement tanks will supply you piped water. It's a dream. And it became a dream also. Because soon the water was not able to reach these areas. And people started renovating their own structures. These are all traditional water structures  which we won't be able to explain in such a short time. But you can see that no woman is standing on those. And they are plaiting hair. Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert. This town was established     years ago. I'm not sure by that time Bombay was there  or Delhi was there  or Chennai was there  or Bangalore was there. So  this was the terminal point for silk route. Well connected      years ago  through Europe. None of us were able to go to Europe  but Jaisalmer was well connected to it. And this is the    centimeter area. Such a limited rainfall  and highest colorful life flourished in these areas. You won't find water in this slide. But it is invisible. Somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here. Or  if you want to paint  you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms. But apart from this system  they designed    beautiful water bodies around this town. And what we call private public partnership you can add estate also. So  estate  public and private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful water body. And it's a kind of water body for all seasons. You will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year. Whether water level goes up or down  the beauty is there throughout. Another water body  dried up  of course  during the summer period  but you can see how the traditional society combines engineering with aesthetics  with the heart. These statues  marvelous statues  gives you an idea of water table. When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank  it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in English today  mass communication.  This was for mass communication. Everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned  so water will be there for seven months or nine months  or    months. And then they will come and worship this pond  pay respect  their gratitude. Another small water body  called the  unclear . It is difficult to translate in English  especially in my English. But the nearest would be  glory   a reputation. The reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dries up. In severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up. And perhaps they knew the future also. It was designed some     years ago. But perhaps they knew that on sixth  November        there will be a TED green and blue session  so they painted it like this. Dry water body. Children are standing on a very difficult device to explain. This is called kund. We have  in English  surface water and ground water. But this is not ground water. You can draw ground water from any well. But this is no ordinary well. It squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand. And they have dubbed this water as the third one called  unclear . And there is a gypsum belt running below it. And it was deposited by the great mother Earth  some three million years ago. And where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water. This is the same dry water body. Now  you don't find any kund  they are all submerged. But when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year. This year they have received only six centimeters. Six centimeter of rainfall  and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your city  Delhi  Bombay  Bangalore  Mysore  please come to our area of six centimeters  we can give you water. How they maintain them  There are three things  concept  planning  making the actual thing  and also maintaining them. It is a structure for maintain  for centuries  by generations  without any department  without any funding  So the secret is   unclear    respect. Your own thing  not personal property  my property  every time. So  these stone pillars will remind you that you are entering into a water body area. Don't spit  don't do anything wrong  so that the clean water can be collected. Another pillar  stone pillar on your right side. If you climb these three  six steps you will find something very nice. This was done in   th century. And you have to go further down. They say that a picture is worth a thousand words  so we can say a thousand words right now  an another thousand words. If the water table goes down  you will find new stairs. If it comes up  some of them will be submerged. So  throughout the year this beautiful system will give you some pleasure. Three sides  such steps  on the fourth side there is a four story building where you can organize such TED conferences anytime. Excuse me  who built these structures  They are in front of you. The best civil engineers we had  the best planners  the best architects. We can say that because of them  because of their forefathers  India could get the first engineering college in     . There were no English medium schools at that time  even no Hindi schools   unclear  schools. But such people  compelled to the East India Company  which came here for business  a very dirty kind of business ... but not to create the engineering colleges. But because of them  first engineering college was created in a small village  not in the town. The last point  we all know in our primary schools that that camel is a ship of desert. So  you can find through your Jeep  a camel  and a cart. This tire comes from the airplane. So  look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater  and also create something through a tire from a jet plane  and used in a camel cart. Last picture  it's a tattoo        years old tattoo. They were using it on their body. Tattoo was  at one time  a kind of a blacklisted or con thing  but now it is in thing. You can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this. The center of life is water. These are the beautiful waves. These are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides. These are the trees. And these are the flowers which add fragrance to our lives. So  this is the message of desert. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  So  first of all  I wish I had your eloquence  truly  in any language. These artifacts and designs are inspiring. Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere  that the world can learn from this  Or is this just right for this place  Anupam Mishra  No  the basic idea is to utilize water that falls on our area. So  the ponds  the open bodies  are everywhere  right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir  and in other parts also. And these  unclear   which stored water  there are two type of things. One recharge  and one stores. So  it depends on the terrain. But kund  which uses the gypsum belt  for that you have to go back to your calendar  three million years ago. If it is there it can be done right now. Otherwise  it can't be done. CA  Thank you so much. For the last    years I've been designing puzzles. And I'm here today to give you a little tour  starting from the very first puzzle I designed  through what I'm doing now. I've designed puzzles for books  printed things. I'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine. I've been doing that for about    years. I have a monthly puzzle calendar. I do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games. I did puzzles for  Bejeweled.  I didn't invent  Bejeweled.  I can't take credit for that. So  very first puzzle  sixth grade  my teacher said   Oh  let's see  that guy  he likes to make stuff. I'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the board.  I thought this was a great assignment. And so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it. I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet that's been folded just once. The question is  which letter is it if I unfold it  One hint  It's not  L.  It could be an  L   of course. So  what else could it be  Yeah  a lot of you got it. Oh yeah. So  clever thing. Now  that was my first puzzle. I got hooked. I created something new  I was very excited because  you know  I'd made crossword puzzles  but that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix. This was something really original. I got hooked. I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American. Went on  and eventually decided to devote myself  full time  to that. Now  I should pause and say  what do I mean by puzzle  A puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve and has a right answer.  Fun to solve   as opposed to everyday problems  which  frankly  are not very well designed puzzles. You know  they might have a solution. It might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly. Who designed this  It's like  you know  life is not a very well written story so we have to hire writers to make movies. Well  I take everyday problems  and I make puzzles out of them. And  right answer   of course there might be more than one right answer  many puzzles have more than one. But as opposed to a couple other forms of play  toys and games    by toy I mean  something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal. You can create one out of Legos. You know  you can do anything you want. Or competitive games like chess where  well  you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle  but the goal really is to beat another player. I consider that puzzles are an art form. They're very ancient. It goes back as long as there is written history. It's a very small form  like a joke  a poem  a magic trick or a song  very compact form. At worst  they're throwaways  they're for amusement. But at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression. The progression of my career that you'll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact. So  one thing I found early on  when I started doing computer games  is that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception. I'll show you how. Here is a famous one. So  it's two profiles in black  or a white vase in the middle. This is called a figure ground illusion. The artist M.C. Escher exploited that in some of his wonderful prints. Here we have  Day and Night.  Here is what I did with figure and ground. So  here we have  figure  in black. Here we have  figure  in white. And it's all part of the same design. The background to one is the other. Originally I tried to do the words  figure  and  ground.  But I couldn't do that  I realized. I changed the problem. It's all  figure.  A few other things. Here is my name. And that turns into the title of my first book   Inversions.  These sorts of designs now go by the word  ambigram.  I'll show you just a couple others. Here we have the numbers one through     the digits zero through nine  actually. Each letter here is one of these digits. Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense. I like pushing on what an ambigram can mean. Here's the word  mirror.  No  it's not the same upside down. It's the same this way. And a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab who just got appointed head of RISD  is John Maeda. And so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon. And recently in Magic magazine I've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names. So here we have Penn and Teller  same upside down. This appears in my puzzle calendar. Okay  let's go back to the slides. Thank you very much. Now  those are fun to look at. Now how would you do it interactively  For a while I was an interface designer. And so I think a lot about interaction. Well  let's first of all simplify the vases illusion  make the thing on the right. Now  if you could pick up the black vase  it would look like the figure on top. If you could pick up the white area  it would look like the figure on the bottom. Well  you can't do that physically  but on a computer you can do it. Let's switch over to the P.C. And here it is  figure ground. The goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right. And this follows the rules I just said  any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up. But that is also true of any white area. So  here we got the white area in the middle  and you can pick it up. I'll just go one step further. So  here is    here is a couple pieces. Move them together  and now this is an active piece. You can really get inside somebody's perception and have them experience something. It's like the old maxim of  you can tell somebody something and show them  but if they do it they really learn it.  Here is another thing you can do. There is a game called Rush Hour. This is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design besides Rubik's cube. So  here we have a crowded parking lot with cars all over the place. The goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle. It's made by the company Think Fun. It's done very well. I love this puzzle. Well  let's play one. Here. So  here is a very simple puzzle. Well  that's too simple  let's add another piece. Okay  so how would you solve this one  Well  move the blue one out of the way. Here  let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy. Now we'll make it harder  a little harder. Now  this one is a little bit trickier. You know  What do you do here  The first move is going to be what  You're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right. And you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all. Those four are locked in a pinwheel  you can't get them apart. I wanted to make a sequel. I didn't come up with the original idea. But this is another way I work as an inventor is to create a sequel. I came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour. It's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece  a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically. In the other game the cars can only move forward and back. Created a whole bunch of levels for it. Now I'm making it available to schools. And it includes exercises that show you not just how to solve these puzzles  but how to extract the principles that will let you solve mathematical puzzles or problems in science  other areas. So  I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles as well as just me creating them. Garry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist. You know  he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon. In Discover Magazine  I'm an investigative puzzle maker. I got interested in gene sequencing. And I said   Well  how on Earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in DNA   Cut up the DNA  you sequence individual pieces  and then you look for overlaps  and you basically match them at the edges. And I said   This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle  except the pieces overlap.  So  here is what I created for Discover Magazine. And it has to be solvable in a magazine. You know  you can't cut out the pieces and move them around. So  here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid. And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge. There is only one solution. It's not that hard. But it takes some persistence. And when you're done  it makes this design  which  if you squint  is the word  helix.  So  that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content  rather than the other way around. Here is a couple more. Here is a physics based puzzle. Which way will these fall  One of these weighs    pounds     pounds and    pounds. And depending on which one weighs which amount  they'll fall different directions. And here is a puzzle based on color mixing. I separated this image into cyan  magenta  yellow  black  the basic printing colors  and then mixed up the separations  and you get these peculiar pictures. Which separations were mixed up to make those pictures  Gets you thinking about color. Finally  what I'm doing now. So  ShuffleBrain.com  website you can go visit  I joined up with my wife  Amy Jo Kim. She could easily be up here giving a talk about her work. So  we're making smart games for social media. I'll explain what that means. We're looking at three trends. This is what's going on in the games industry right now. First of all  you know  for a long time computer games meant things like  Doom   where you're going around shooting things  very violent games  very fast  aimed at teenage boys. Right  That's who plays computer games. Well  guess what  That's changing.  Bejeweled  is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open what's called casual games. And the main players are over     and are female. Then recently  Rock Band  has been a big hit. And it's a game you play with other people. It's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game. This is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming. Now  within that there is some interesting things happening. There is also a trend towards games that are good for you. Why  Well  we aging Boomers  Baby Boomers  we're eating our healthy food  we're exercising. What about our minds  Oh no  our parents are getting Alzheimer's. We better do something. Turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's. So  we got games like  Brain Age  coming out for the Nintendo DS  huge hit. A lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it. And then there is social media  and what's happening on the Internet. Everybody now considers themselves a creator  and not just a viewer. And what does this add up to  Here is what we see coming. It's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle. They're part of your life. They're not necessarily a separate thing. And they are both  something that is good for you  and they're fun. I'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media. And we decided to combine our skills. Our first game is called  Photo Grab.  The game takes about a minute and    seconds. This is your first time playing my game. Okay. Let's see how well we can do. There are three images. And we have    seconds each. Where is that  I'll play as fast as I can. But if you can see it  shout out the answer. You get more    Down  okay  yeah where is that  Oh  yeah. There  okay. J O and    I guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps. That's his hair. You get a lot of figure ground problems. Yeah  that one is easy. Okay. So  ahhh  Okay on to the next one. Okay  so that's the lens. Anybody  Looks like a black shape. So  where is that  That's the corner of the whole thing. Yeah  I've played this image before  but even when I make up my own puzzles    and you can put your own images in here. And we have people all over the world doing that now. There we are. Visit ShuffleBrain.com if you want to try it yourself. Thank you. I'm talking to you about the worst form of human rights violation  the third largest organized crime  a     billion industry. I'm talking to you about modern day slavery. I'd like to tell you the story of these three children  Pranitha  Shaheen and Anjali. Pranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution  a prostituted person. She got infected with HIV  and towards the end of her life  when she was in the final stages of AIDS  she could not prostitute  so she sold four year old Pranitha to a broker. By the time we got the information  we reached there  Pranitha was already raped by three men. Shaheen's background I don't even know. We found her in a railway track  raped by many  many men  I don't know many. But the indications of that on her body was that her intestine was outside her body. And when we took her to the hospital she needed    stitches to put back her intestine into her body. We still don't know who her parents are  who she is. All that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally. Anjali's father  a drunkard  sold his child for pornography. You're seeing here images of three years  four year olds  and five year old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation. In this country  and across the globe  hundreds and thousands of children  as young as three  as young as four  are sold into sexual slavery. But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for. They are sold in the name of adoption. They are sold in the name of organ trade. They are sold in the name of forced labor  camel jockeying  anything  everything. I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation. And I tell you stories from there. My own journey to work with these children started as a teenager. I was    when I was gang raped by eight men. I don't remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it. Yes  there were eight men who defiled me  raped me  but that didn't go into my consciousness. I never felt like a victim  then or now. But what lingered from then till now    I am    today    is this huge outrageous anger. Two years  I was ostracized  I was stigmatized  I was isolated  because I was a victim. And that's what we do to all traffic survivors. We  as a society  we have PhDs in victimizing a victim. Right from the age of     when I started looking around me  I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in sexual slavery like practices  but have absolutely no respite  because we don't allow them to come in. Where does their journey begin  Most of them come from very optionless families  not just poor. You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked. I had this I.S. officer's daughter  who is    years old  studying in ninth standard  who was raped chatting with one individual  and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine  who was trafficked. I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well to do families  and children from well to do families  who are getting trafficked. These people are deceived  forced.   .  percent of them resist being inducted into prostitution. Some pay the price for it. They're killed  we don't even hear about them. They are voiceless   unclear   nameless people. But the rest  who succumb into it  go through everyday torture. Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends  or who want to have a family with you. These are men who buy you for an hour  for a day  and use you  throw you. Each of the girls that I have rescued    I have rescued more than       girls    each of them tell me one story in common ... one story about one man  at least  putting chili powder in her vagina  one man taking a cigarette and burning her  one man whipping her. We are living among those men  they're our brothers  fathers  uncles  cousins  all around us. And we are silent about them. We think it is easy money. We think it is shortcut. We think the person likes to do what she's doing. But the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections  sexually transmitted infections  HIV  AIDS  syphilis  gonorrhea  you name it  substance abuse  drugs  everything under the sun. And one day she gives up on you and me  because we have no options for her. And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation. She believes   Yes  this is it  this is what my destiny is about.  And this is normal  to get raped by     men a day. And it's abnormal to live in a shelter. It's abnormal to get rehabilitated. It's in that context that I work. It's in that context that I rescue children. I've rescued children as young as three years  and I've rescued women as old as    years. When I rescued them  one of the biggest challenges I had was where do I begin. Because I had lots of them who were already HIV infected. One third of the people I rescue are HIV positive. And therefore my challenge was to understand how can I get out the power from this pain. And for me  I was my greatest experience. Understanding my own self  understanding my own pain  my own isolation  was my greatest teacher. Because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential. You see a girl here who is trained as a welder. She works for a very big company  a workshop in Hyderabad  making furnitures. She earns around        rupees. She is an illiterate girl  trained  skilled as a welder. Why welding and why not computers  We felt  one of the things that these girls had is immense amount of courage. They did not have any pardas inside their body  hijabs inside themselves  they've crossed the barrier of it. And therefore they could fight in a male dominated world  very easily  and not feel very shy about it. We have trained girls as carpenters  as masons  as security guards  as cab drivers. And each one of them are excelling in their chosen field  gaining confidence  restoring dignity  and building hopes in their own lives. These girls are also working in big construction companies like Ram ki construction  as masons  full time masons. What has been my challenge  My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up. I've been beaten up more than    times in my life. I can't hear from my right ear. I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue. My biggest challenge is society. It's you and me. My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own. A very supportive friend of mine  a well wisher of mine  used to give me every month        rupees for vegetables. When her mother fell sick she said   Sunitha  you have so much of contacts. Can you get somebody in my house to work  so that she can look after my mother   And there is a long pause. And then she says   Not one of our girls.  It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking  in this fantastic A C hall. It's very nice for discussion  discourse  making films and everything. But it is not nice to bring them to our homes. It's not nice to give them employment in our factories  our companies. It's not nice for our children to study with their children. There it ends. That's my biggest challenge. If I'm here today  I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan. I'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking. They need your compassion. They need your empathy. They need  much more than anything else  your acceptance. Many times when I talk to people  I keep telling them one thing  don't tell me hundred ways how you cannot respond to this problem. Can you ply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem  And that's what I'm here for  asking for your support  demanding for your support  requesting for your support. Can you break your culture of silence  Can you speak to at least two persons about this story  Tell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons. I'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis or Martin Luther Kings  or Medha Patkars  or something like that. I'm asking you  in your limited world  can you open your minds  Can you open your hearts  Can you just encompass these people too  Because they are also a part of us. They are also part of this world. I'm asking you  for these children  whose faces you see  they're no more. They died of AIDS last year. I'm asking you to help them  accept as human beings    not as philanthropy  not as charity  but as human beings who deserve all our support. I'm asking you this because no child  no human being  deserves what these children have gone through. Thank you. Chris has been so nice. I don't know how you keep it up  Chris  I really don't. So nice  all week. He's the kind of man you could say to   Chris  I'm really sorry  I've crashed your car. And it gets worse  I crashed it into your house. Your house has caught fire. And what's more  your wife has just run off with your best friend.  And you know that Chris would say   Thank you.   Thank you for sharing  that's really interesting.   Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn't know existed. Thank you.  One of the     Applause  Thank you for inviting us. One of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that  gradually  as the days go by  all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say. Nuclear fusion  I had about    minutes on that. Spectroscopy  that was another one. Parallel universes. And so this morning I thought   Oh well  I'll just do a card trick.  That one's gone as well. And today is Emmanuel's day  I think we've agreed that  already  haven't we  Emmanuel  Absolutely.  Applause  I was planning on finishing on a dance ... So  that's going to look pretty shabby now. So  what I thought I'd do is    in honor of Emmanuel    is  what I can do is to launch today the first TED Global auction. If I could start  this is the Enigma decoding machine. Who will start me with         Anyone  Thank you. Bruno's face  just then  he said   No  don't go through this. Don't  please don't. Don't go through this. Don't do it.  I'm worried. When I first got the invitation  they said somewhere in the thing  they said      minutes to change the world  your moment onstage.     minutes to change the world. I don't know about you  it takes me    minutes to change a plug. So  the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one. Well  of course now we know we don't have to change a plug  now we've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric    fantastic. You know  it inspires us.     years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that. And now it's an idea. It's great. It's fantastic. But you do meet some fantastic people  people who look at the world in a totally different way. Yesterday  David Deutsch  another one who covered most of what I was going to say. But when you think of the world in that way  it does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience  don't you think  I mean  he must walk in and they will say   Would you like a macchiato  or a latte  or an Americano  or a cappuccino   And he'll say   You're offering me things that are infinitely variable.   How can your coffee be true   And they will say   Would you mind if I serve the next customer   And Elaine Morgan yesterday  wasn't she wonderful  Fantastic. Really good. Her talk about the aquatic ape  and the link  of course  the link between Darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this    we're not hirsute and we can swim rather well. And she said  you know  she's   . She's running out of time  she said. And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link. And I think   I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh.  This man has swum around the North Pole  what more evidence do you want  And there he is. That's how TED brings these connections together. I wasn't here on Tuesday. I didn't actually see Gordon Brown's job application    um  sorry. I'm so sorry.  Applause  I'm so sorry. No  no.  Applause  No  no  ahh ...  Applause  The problem I have is because Gordon Brown  he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who's just taken the head off a bear suit. Uh  no.   Laughter   I'm sorry. I've only got    minutes     minutes to talk about saving the world  saving the planet  global institutions. Our work on climate change  I've only got    minutes  unfortunately I'm not able to tell you about all the wonderful things we're doing to promote the climate change agenda in Great Britain  like the third runway we're planning at Heathrow Airport ...   The large coal fired power station we're building at King's North  and of course the exciting news that only today  only this week  Britain's only manufacturer of wind turbines has been forced to close. No time  unfortunately  to mention those.   British jobs for Scottish people ... No.   Laughter   Christian principles  Christian values. Thou shalt not kill  thou shalt not steal  thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.   Although to be honest  when I was at Number    that was never going to be a problem.  Alright Gordon  come on  eh. I just  can I just say a few things about  first about Cherie  because she's a wonderful lady  my wife  with a wonderful smile. That reminds me  I must post that letter.   I just think  you know  what people forget  Gordon and I  we always got on perfectly well. Alright  it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain.'   You know  I wrote to him  just before I left office. I said  'Can I rely on your support for the next month ' And he wrote back. He said  'No  you can't.' Which kind of surprised me  because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before.  Another thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the Mansion House in         that was to the building  the people weren't listening. But the people  when talking about the finance industry  he said   What you as the city of London have done for financial services  we  as a government  hope to do for the economy as a whole.  When you think what's happened to financial services  and you see what's happened to the economy  you think   Well  there is a man who delivers on his promises.  But we're in a new world now. We're in a completely new world. This is the first time that I can remember  where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan  you don't know if you're borrowing money from him  or if he's borrowing money from you. Am I right  These extraordinary things  Icelandic Internet accounts. Did anyone here have an Icelandic Internet account  Why would you do that  Why would    It's like one step up from replying to one of those emails from Nigeria  isn't it  Asking for your bank details. And  you know  Iceland  it was never going to cut it. It didn't have that kind of collateral. What does it have  It has fish  that's all. That's why the Prime Minister went on television. He said   This has left us all with a very big haddock.  A lot of what I do    I have to try and make sense of things before I can make nonsense of them. And making sense of the financial crisis is very  very difficult. Luckily  somebody like George Bush was really helpful. He summed it up  really  at a dinner. He was speaking at a dinner  he said   Wall Street got drunk.   And now it's got a hangover.  And that's  you know  that's something    And that's something we can relate to. It's certainly something he can relate to. And the other one  of course  is Donald Rumsfeld  who said   There are the known knowns  the things we know we know. And then you got the known unknowns  the things we know we don't know. And then you got the unknown unknowns  those are the things we don't know we don't know.  And being English  when I first heard that I thought   What a load of cock.  And then  you're now  well  actually  that's what this is about. This whole  what Ben Bernanke has said  the chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system  it's about    they don't know  they didn't know what they were doing. In       the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said  quote   As we can clearly see  no seismic occurrence is about to overwhelm the U.S. economy.  Now  there is a man on top of his job. And when the crisis was happening  the head of quantitative equities at Lehman Brothers said   Events which models predicted would happen once every        years happened every day for three days.  So  it's extraordinary. It's a new world that's very  very difficult to make sense of. But we have a new hope. We have a new man. America has now elected its first openly black President. Wonderful news. Not only that  he's left handed. Have you noticed this  How many people here are left handed  You see  a lot of the people that I most admire  they're great artists  great designers  great thinkers  they're left handed. And somebody said to me last night  you know  being left handed  you have to learn to write without smudging the ink. And somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday. And I thought  what a wonderful metaphor  isn't it  An American President who has to write without smudging the ink. You like that one  As opposed to you could see George Bush  well  what's the metaphor there  I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing  wouldn't it   Well  you know I'm sorry about that. I'm right handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well.  But  you know  he's gone. Now he's gone. That's eight years of American History  eight minutes of my act  just gone like that.  You know  it's the end of an error  sic . I happen to believe it was a great error. I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the United States. But we proved them wrong in Iraq. They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda. There is now.   But I have a message for the suicide bombers  for those people who've blown themselves up.   We're going to find you.   We're going to make sure you don't do it again.  But now he's gone  and it's great to see one of the    arguably one of the worst speech makers in American history  now given way to one of the greatest  in Obama. You were there  maybe  on the night of his victory. And he spoke to the crowd in Chicago  he said   If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible ...  I can't do the whole thing because it would take too long  it really would. But you get the picture. And then it goes to the inauguration. And he and the Chief Justice  they trip over each other  they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up. And there is George Bush sitting there going   Heh heh heh heh ...   Not so easy is it  Heh heh heh.  But the interesting thing is  Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero  who said  people would listen to a speech  they said   Great speech.  And then they'd listen to Demosthenes  and they'd say   Let's march.  And we all want to believe in President Obama. It's rather like that line in the film  As Good As it Gets.  Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson  and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson   What do you see in me   And Jack Nicholson just says   You make me want to be a better man.  And you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen. Right  But at the moment  it's a Cicero thing. We like what Barack Obama says  but we don't do anything about it. So he comes over to this country  and he says   We need a big fiscal stimulus.  And everyone goes   Great   He leaves the country and the French and the Germans go   No  no  forget about that  absolutely not.  Nothing happens. He goes to Strasburg. He says   We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan.  And everyone goes   Great idea.  He leaves  people go   No no no  we're not going to do that.       maximum  and no rockets. No  no  not going to do it.  He goes to Prague  he says   We believe in a nuclear free world.  And it's great to have an American president who can say the word  nuclear   let's just point that out first. Do you remember that  George Bush   A nu ca ler.  Sorry  what   A nu ca ler.  Could you say  avuncular    Avunclear.  Thank you very much. But he says   We want a nuclear free world.  And that day  North Korea  that very day  North Korea is just seeing if it can just get one over Japan    and land it before ... So  where do we look for inspiration  We've still got Bill Clinton.  Travels the world.   Laughs   I believe  I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ...   Tell a lie  it was Diana Ross ...   ... who said  reach out and touch ...   ... somebody's gla    hand.   Make this world a better place  if you can. I just think that's important. I really do. And I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House  because she'd have been out of our home for four years. And I  you know.   Laughter   So  when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements  let me tell you.  So  there's him. In Britain we have Prince Charles   And the environment is so important  all we can do. My wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to push emissions up her agenda.  Or  any South Africans  we have Mandela to inspire. Mandela  the great man Mandela. He's been honored with a statue now. The previous highest honor he had in Britain was a visit from the team from Ground Force  a gardening program.  So  Nelson  how would you like a nice water feature    Ahh  listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh.   I was held in prison for nearly    years on an island in the middle of the ocean. Why would I need a bloody water feature   Very quickly  I wasn't quite sure how to end this talk and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote from the  Japanese Essays on Idleness  which said it's nice to have something which is unfinished because it implies there is still room for growth. Thank you very much indeed. The National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated to presenting great American lives  amazing people. And that's what it's about. We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives  but that's it. And so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today. I'm going to talk about a program I started there  which  from my point of view  is the proudest thing I did. I started to worry about the fact that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore  and they're amazing people  and we want to deliver them to future generations. So  how do we do that  And so I came up with the idea of the living self portrait series. And the living self portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and I would interview. And so what I'm going to do is  not so much give you the great hits of that program  as to give you this whole notion of how you encounter people in that kind of situation  what you try to find out about them  and when people deliver and when they don't and why. Now  I had two preconditions. One was that they be American. That's just because  in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery  it's created to look at American lives. That was easy  but then I made the decision  maybe arbitrary  that they needed to be people of a certain age  which at that point  when I created this program  seemed really old. Sixties  seventies  eighties and nineties. For obvious reasons  it doesn't seem that old anymore to me. And why did I do that  Well  for one thing  we're a youth obsessed culture. And I thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk. But the second part of it    and the older I get  the more convinced I am that that's true. It's amazing what people will say when they know how the story turned out. That's the one advantage that older people have. Well  they have other  little bit of advantage  but they also have some disadvantages  but the one thing they or we have is that we've reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out. So  we can then go back in our lives  if we've got an interviewer who gets that  and begin to reflect on how we got there. All of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited. So  I thought okay  now  what is it going to take to make this work  There are many kinds of interviews. We know them. There are the journalist interviews  which are the interrogation that is expected. This is somewhat against resistance and caginess on the part of the interviewee. Then there's the celebrity interview  where it's more important who's asking the question than who answers. That's Barbara Walters and others like that  and we like that. That's Frost Nixon  where Frost seems to be as important as Nixon in that process. Fair enough. But I wanted interviews that were different. I wanted to be  as I later thought of it  empathic  which is to say  to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their self revelation. By the way  this was always done in public. This was not an oral history program. This was all about     people sitting at the feet of this individual  and having me be the brush in their self portrait. Now  it turns out that I was pretty good at that. I didn't know it coming into it. And the only reason I really know that is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright  and that was six months after he'd had a stroke. And he had never appeared in public since that point. This was not a devastating stroke  but it did affect his speaking and so forth. And I thought it was worth a chance  he thought it was worth a chance  and so we got up on the stage  and we had an hour conversation about his life  and after that a woman rushed up to me  essentially did  and she said   Where did you train as a doctor   And I said   I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that.  And she said   Well  something very weird was happening. When he started a sentence  particularly in the early parts of the interview  and paused  you gave him the word  the bridge to get to the end of the sentence  and by the end of it  he was speaking complete sentences on his own.  I didn't know what was going on  but I was so part of the process of getting that out. So I thought  okay  fine  I've got empathy  or empathy  at any rate  is what's critical to this kind of interview. But then I began to think of other things. Who makes a great interview in this context  It had nothing to do with their intellect  the quality of their intellect. Some of them were very brilliant  some of them were  you know  ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals  but it was never about that. It was about their energy. It's energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary lives. I'm convinced of it. And it had nothing to do with the energy of being young. These were people through their   s. In fact  the first person I interviewed was George Abbott  who was     and Abbott was filled with the life force    I guess that's the way I think about it    filled with it. And so he filled the room  and we had an extraordinary conversation. He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do because he was famous for being silent  for never ever saying anything except maybe a word or two. And  in fact  he did wind up opening up    by the way  his energy is evidenced in other ways. He subsequently got married again at      so he  you know  he had a lot of the life force in him. But after the interview  I got a call  very gruff voice  from a woman. I didn't know who she was  and she said   Did you get George Abbott to talk   And I said   Yeah. Apparently I did.  And she said   I'm his old girlfriend  Maureen Stapleton  and I could never do it.  And then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that George Abbott actually could talk. So  you know  you want energy  you want the life force  but you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing. The worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are modest. Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest  because all of these people have been assembled to listen to them  and they sit there and they say   Aw  shucks  it was an accident.  There's nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking good hours of the day to be with them. The worst interview I ever did  William L. Shirer. The journalist who did  The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.  This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months  and every time I'd ask him about it  he'd say   Oh  I just happened to be there. Didn't matter.  Whatever. Awful. I never would ever agree to interview a modest person. They have to think that they did something and that they want to share it with you. But it comes down  in the end  to how do you get through all the barriers we have. All of us are public and private beings  and if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self  there's no point in it. It's pre programmed. It's infomercial  and we all have infomercials about our lives. We know the great lines  we know the great moments  we know what we're not going to share  and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody. This wasn't    and some of you will remember Mike Wallace's old interviews    tough  aggressive and so forth. They have their place. I was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say  to break out of their own cocoon of the public self  and the more public they had been  the more entrenched that person  that outer person was. And let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment that happened in this interview series. It all has to do with that shell that most of us have  and particularly certain people. There's an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce. It'll be your generational determinant as to whether her name means much to you. She did so much. She was a playwright. She did an extraordinary play called  The Women.  She was a congresswoman when there weren't very many congresswomen. She was editor of Vanity Fair  one of the great phenomenal women of her day. And  incidentally  I call her the Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right. She was sort of adored on the Right the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left. And  in fact  when we did the interview    I did the living self portrait with her    there were three former directors of the CIA basically sitting at her feet  just enjoying her presence. And I thought  this is going to be a piece of cake  because I always have preliminary talks with these people for just maybe    or    minutes. We never talk before that because if you talk before  you don't get it on the stage. So she and I had a delightful conversation. We were on the stage and then    by the way  spectacular. It was all part of Clare Boothe Luce's look. She was in a great evening gown. She was     almost that day of the interview  and there she was and there I was  and I just proceeded into the questions. And she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable. Anything that I would ask  she would turn around  dismiss  and I was basically up there    any of you in the moderate to full entertainment world know what it is to die onstage. And I was dying. She was absolutely not giving me a thing. And I began to wonder what was going on  and you think while you talk  and basically  I thought  I got it. When we were alone  I was her audience. Now I'm her competitor for the audience. That's the problem here  and she's fighting me for that  and so then I asked her a question    I didn't know how I was going to get out of it    I asked her a question about her days as a playwright  and again  characteristically  instead of saying   Oh yes  I was a playwright  and this is what blah blah blah   she said   Oh  playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright. Most people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress.  But I hadn't asked that  and then she went off on a tear  and she said   Oh  well  there was that one time that I was an actress. It was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman  and I got up there   and she went on and on   And then I got on the stage.  And then she turned to me and said   And you know what those young actors did  They upstaged me.  And she said   Do you know what that is   Just withering in her contempt. And I said   I'm learning.  And she looked at me  and it was like the successful arm wrestle  and then  after that  she delivered an extraordinary account of what her life really was like. I have to end that one. This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce. Again  a remarkable person. I'm not politically attracted to her  but through her life force  I'm attracted to her. And the way she died    she had  toward the end  a brain tumor. That's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine  and very few of us were invited to a dinner party. And she was in horrible pain. We all knew that. She stayed in her room. Everybody came. The butler passed around canapes. The usual sort of thing. Then at a certain moment  the door opened and she walked out perfectly dressed  completely composed. The public self  the beauty  the intellect  and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room and was never seen again. She wanted the control of her final moment  and she did it amazingly. Now  there are other ways that you get somebody to open up  and this is just a brief reference. It wasn't this arm wrestle  but it was a little surprising for the person involved. I interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago. And we were sitting there  and almost toward the beginning of the interview  I turned to him and I said   Steve   or  Mr. Martin  it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods. Was yours unhappy   And he looked at me  you know  as if to say   This is how you're going to start this thing  right off   And then he turned to me  not stupidly  and he said   What was your childhood like   And I said    these are all arm wrestles  but they're affectionate    and I said   My father was loving and supportive  which is why I'm not funny.  And he looked at me  and then we heard the big sad story. His father was an SOB  and  in fact  he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood  but then we were off and running. So the question is  What is the key that's going to allow this to proceed  Now  these are arm wrestle questions  but I want to tell you about questions that are more related to empathy and that really  very often  are the questions that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked. And I'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints. One was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers. Again  some of you will know him  most of you won't  Dumas Malone. He did a five volume biography of Thomas Jefferson  spent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson  and by the way  at one point I asked him   Would you like to have met him   And he said   Well  of course  but actually  I know him better than anyone who ever met him  because I got to read all of his letters.  So  he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over    years. And I asked him one question. I said   Did Jefferson ever disappoint you   And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson and connecting with him  and he said   Well ...     I'm going to do a bad southern accent. Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally. But he said   Well   he said   I'm afraid so.  He said   You know  I've read everything  and sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit.  And he basically was saying that this was a man who lied more than he wished he had  because he saw the letters. He said   But I understand that.  He said   I understand that.  He said   We southerners do like a smooth surface  so that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation.  And he said   Now  John Adams was too honest.  And he started to talk about that  and later on he invited me to his house  and I met his wife who was from Massachusetts  and he and she had exactly the relationship of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. She was the New Englander and abrasive  and he was this courtly fellow. But really the most important question I ever asked  and most of the times when I talk about it  people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity  or cruelty  but I promise you it was the right question. This was to Agnes de Mille. Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history. She basically created the dances in  Oklahoma   transforming the American theater. An amazing woman. At the time that I proposed to her that    by the way  I would have proposed to her  she was extraordinary    but proposed to her that she come on. She said   Come to my apartment.  She lived in New York.  Come to my apartment and we'll talk for those    minutes  and then we'll decide whether we proceed.  And so I showed up in this dark  rambling New York apartment  and she called out to me  and she was in bed. I had known that she had had a stroke  and that was some    years before. And so she spent almost all of her life in bed  but    I speak of the life force    her hair was askew. She wasn't about to make up for this occasion. And she was sitting there surrounded by books  and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment was her will  which she had by her side. She wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned. She said   I keep this will by my bed  memento mori  and I change it all the time just because I want to.  And she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life. I thought  this is somebody I've got to get in this series. She agreed. She came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on. Half of her body was stricken  the other half not. She was  of course  done up for the occasion  but this was a woman in great physical distress. And we had a conversation  and then I asked her this unthinkable question. I said   Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful   And the audience just    you know  they're always on the side of the interviewee  and they felt that this was a kind of assault  but this was the question she had wanted somebody to ask her whole life. And she began to talk about her childhood  when she was beautiful  and she literally turned    here she was  in this broken body    and she turned to the audience and described herself as the fair demoiselle with her red hair and her light steps and so forth  and then she said   And then puberty hit.  And she began to talk about things that had happened to her body and her face  and how she could no longer count on her beauty  and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one for whom all the ballet lessons were given. And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company  and in that process  she made a number of decisions. First of all  was that dance  even though it hadn't been offered to her  was her life. And secondly  she had better be  although she did dance for a while  a choreographer because then her looks didn't matter. But she was thrilled to get that out as a real  real fact in her life. It was an amazing privilege to do this series. There were other moments like that  very few moments of silence. The key point was empathy because everybody in their lives is really waiting for people to ask them questions  so that they can be truthful about who they are and how they became what they are  and I commend that to you  even if you're not doing interviews. Just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family. Thank you very much. Good morning. I've come here to share with you an experiment of how to get rid of one form of human suffering. It really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy. His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System. I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind. Woman  Everywhere I went looking for work  they said no  what use do we have for a blind woman  I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair. If an ant fell into my rice  I couldn't see that either. Thulasiraj Ravilla  Becoming blind is a big part of it  but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood  their dignity  their independence  and their status in the family. So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind. And the irony is that they don't need to be. A simple  well proven surgery can restore sight to millions  and something even simpler  a pair of glasses  can make millions more see. If we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses  then almost one in five Indians will require eye care  a staggering     million people. Today  we're reaching not even    percent of them. So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence about    years back as a post retirement project of Dr. V. He started this with no money. He had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan. And over time  we have grown into a network of five hospitals  predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry  and then we added several  what we call Vision Centers as a hub and spoke model. And then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well. The last three decades  we have done about three and a half million surgeries  a vast majority of them for the poor people. Now  each year we perform about         surgeries. A typical day at Aravind  we would do about a thousand surgeries  maybe see about       patients  send out teams into the villages to examine  bring back patients  lots of telemedicine consultations  and  on top of that  do a lot of training  both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind. And then doing this day in and day out  and doing it well  requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work. And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by Dr. V.  a value system  an efficient delivery process  and fostering the culture of innovation. Dr. V  I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village  and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being  you seem to be one with him. Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence. Doctor  whatever you say  I accept it. An implicit faith in you and then you respond to it. Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me  I must do my best for her. When we grow in spiritual consciousness  we identify ourselves with all that is in the world  so there is no exploitation. It is ourselves we are helping. It is ourselves we are healing. This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient centric organization and systems that support it. But on a practical level  you also have to deliver services efficiently  and  odd as it may seem  the inspiration came from McDonald's. Dr. V  See  McDonald's' concept is simple. They feel they can train people all over the world  irrespective of different religions  cultures  all those things  to produce a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in hundreds of places. Larry Brilliant  He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers  and none of it made any sense to us. He wanted to create a franchise  a mechanism of delivery of eye care with the efficiency of McDonald's. Dr. V  Supposing I'm able to produce eye care  techniques  methods  all in the same way  and make it available in every corner of the world. The problem of blindness is gone. TR  If you think about it  I think the eyeball is the same  as American or African  the problem is the same  the treatment is the same. And yet  why should there be so much variation in quality and in service  and that was the fundamental principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems. And  of course  the challenge was that it's a huge problem  we are talking of millions of people  very little resource to deal with it  and then lots of logistics and affordability issues. And then so  one had to constantly innovate. And one of the early innovations  which still continues  is to create ownership in the community to the problem  and then engage with them as a partner  and here is one such event. Here a community camp just organized by the community themselves  where they find a place  organize volunteers  and then we'll do our part. You know  check their vision  and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done  and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses  or check for glaucoma. And then  with all these results  the doctor makes a final diagnosis  and then prescribes a line of treatment  and if they need a pair of glasses  they are available right there at the camp site  usually under a tree. But they get glasses in the frames of their choice  and that's very important because I think glasses  in addition to helping people see  is also a fashion statement  and they're willing to pay for it. So they get it in about    minutes and those who require surgery  are counseled  and then there are buses waiting  which will transport them to the base hospital. And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support  many people like this would probably never get services  and certainly not when they most need it. They receive surgery the following day  and then they will stay for a day or two  and then they are put back on the buses to be taken back to where they came from  and where their families will be waiting to take them back home. And this happens several thousand times each year. It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients  very efficient process  but we looked at  are we solving the problem  We did a study  a scientifically designed process  and then  to our dismay  we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need  and we're not adequately addressing more  bigger problems. So we had to do something different  so we set up what we call primary eye care centers  vision centers. These are truly paperless offices with completely electronic medical records and so on. They receive comprehensive eye exams. We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera  and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor. The effect of this has been that  within the first year  we really had a    percent penetration in the market that it served  which is over        people. And the second year went up to    percent. So I think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it  and in this process of using technology  make sure that most don't need to come to the base hospital. And how much will they pay for this  We fixed the pricing  taking into account what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city  so they pay about    rupees  and that's good for three consultations. The other challenge was  how do you give high tech or more advanced treatment and care  We designed a van with a VSAT  which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed  and then as the patient is waiting  the report goes back to the patient  it gets printed out  the patient gets it  and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing    I mean  go see a doctor or come back after six months  and then this happens as a way of bridging the technology competence. So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market  because it focused on the non customer  and then by reaching the unreached  we're able to significantly grow the market. The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists  So what is in this video is a surgeon operating  and then you see on the other side  another patient is getting ready. So  as they finish the surgery  they just swing the microscope over  the tables are placed so that their distance is just right  and then we need to do this  because  by doing this kind of process  we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon. And then to support the surgeon  we require a certain workforce. And then we focused on village girls that we recruited  and then they really are the backbone of the organization. They do almost all of the skill based routine tasks. They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well. With the result we have very high productivity  very high quality at very  very low cost. So  putting all this together  what really happened was the productivity of our staff was significantly higher than anyone else. This is a very busy table  but what this really is conveying is that  when it comes to quality  we have put in very good quality assurance systems. As a result  our complications are significantly lower than what has been reported in the United Kingdom  and you don't see those kind of numbers very often. So the final part of the puzzle is  how do you make all this work financially  especially when the people can't pay for it  So what we did was  we gave away a lot of it for free  and then those who pay  I mean  they paid local market rates  nothing more  and often much less. And we were helped by the market inefficiency. I think that has been a big savior  even now. And  of course  one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus. The result has been  over the years  the expenditure has increased with volumes. The revenues increase at a higher level  giving us a healthy margin while you're treating a large number of people for free. I think in absolute terms  last year we earned about    odd million dollars  spent about    million  with over a    percent EBITA. But this really requires going beyond what we do  or what we have done  if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness. And what we did was a couple of very counter intuitive things. We created competition for ourselves  and then we made eye care affordable by making low cost consumables. We proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals in India  many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well. The impact of this has been that these hospitals  in the second year after our consultation  are double their output and then achieve financial recovery as well. The other part was how do you address this increase in cost of technology  There was a time when we failed to negotiate the  intra ocular lens  prices to be at affordable levels  so we set up a manufacturing unit. And then  over time  we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out. Today  we believe we have about seven percent of the global market  and they're used in about     odd countries. To conclude  I mean  what we do  does it have a broader relevance  or is it just India or developing countries  So to address this  we studied UK versus Aravind. What it shows is that we do roughly about    percent of the volume of what the UK does  near a half million surgeries as a whole country. And we do about        . And then we train about    ophthalmologists against the    trained by them  comparable quality  both in training and in patient care. So we're really comparing apples to apples. We looked at cost. So  I think it is simple to say just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening. I think there is more to it. I mean  I think one has to look at other aspects as well. Maybe there is    the solution to the cost could be in productivity  maybe in efficiency  in the clinical process  or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables  or regulations  their defensive practice. So  I think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the U.S.  and maybe Obama's ratings can go up again. Another insight  which  again  I want to leave with you  in conditions where the problem is very large  which cuts across all economic strata  where we have a good solution  I think the process I described  you know  productivity  quality  patient centered care  can give an answer  and there are many which fit this paradigm. You take dentistry  hearing aid  maternity and so on. There are many where this paradigm can now play  but I think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side. Now  how do you create compassion  Now  how do you make people own the problem  want to do something about it  There are a bit harder issues. And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these. So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you. Dr. V  When you grow in spiritual consciousness  we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation. It is ourselves we are helping. It is ourselves we are healing. TR  Thank you very much. Hello  everyone. Because this is my first time at TED  I've decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit. Yes. That's right. This is Barbie. She's    years old. And she's looking as young as ever. But I'd also like to introduce you to what may be an unfamiliar face. This is Fulla. Fulla is the Arab world's answer to Barbie. Now  according to proponents of the clash of civilizations  Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres. They have different interests. They have divergent values. And should they ever come in contact ... well  I've got to tell you  it's just not going to be pretty. My experience  however  in the Islamic world is very different. Where I work  in the Arab region  people are busy taking up Western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conventionally Western  nor are they traditionally Islamic. I want to show you two examples. The first is  Shbab. It means  for youth  and it's a new Arab TV channel. The USA.   I am not afraid to stand alone     I am not afraid to stand alone  if Allah is by my side     I am not afraid to stand alone     Everything will be all right     I am not afraid to stand alone   The Arab world.   She was preserved by modesty of the religion     She was adorned by the light of the Quran   Shereen El Feki   Shbab has been dubbed Islamic MTV. Its creator  who is an Egyptian TV producer called Ahmed Abu Ha ba  wants young people to be inspired by Islam to lead better lives. He reckons the best way to get that message across is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos.  Shbab was set up as an alternative to existing Arab music channels. And they look something like this. That  by the way is Haifa Wehbe. She's a Lebanese pop star and pan Arab pin up girl. In the world of  Shbab  it's not about bump and grind. But it's not about fire and brimstone either. Its videos are intended to show a kinder  gentler face of Islam  for young people to deal with life's challenges. Now  my second example is for a slightly younger crowd. And it's called  The   .  Now  these are the world's first Islamic superheroes. They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist called Naif Al Mutawa. And his desire is to rescue Islam from images of intolerance  all in a child friendly format.  The   .  The characters are meant to embody the    attributes of Allah  justice  wisdom  mercy  among others. So  for example  there is the character of Noora. She is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone. Another character called Jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions. Now   The     is not just a comic book. It's now a theme park. There is an animated series in the works. And by this time next year  the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman will have joined forces with  The     to beat injustice wherever they find it.  The     and  Shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic cross cultural hybridization. We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations. Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash. I like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations  in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined. Now  while  Shbab and  The     may look new and shiny  there is actually a very long tradition of this. Throughout its history  Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations both ancient and modern. After all  it's the Quran which encourages us to do this   We made you into nations and tribes so that you could learn from one another.  And to my mind  those are pretty wise words  no matter what your creed. Thank you. I'm going to show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life.    years ago I received a phone call from a friend. At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners in Italian jails. He asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades. Now  as many of you may remember  the Red Brigades was a terrorist  Marxist organization which was very active in Italy from the     s until the mid     s. As part of their strategy the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody  not even with their lawyers. They sat in silence through their trails  waving occasionally at family and friends. In      they declared the end of the armed struggle. And they drew a list of people with whom they would talk  and tell their story. And I was one of those people. When I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me  he said that the female members of the organization had actually supported my name. In particular  one person had put it forward. She was my childhood friend. She had joined the Red Brigades and became a leader of the organization. Naturally  I didn't know that until the day she was arrested. In fact  I read it in the newspaper. At the time of the phone call I just had a baby  I successfully completed a management buyout to the company I was working with  and the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home and touring the high security prisons. But this is exactly what I did because I wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist  and why she'd never tried to recruit me. So  this is exactly what I did. Now  I found the answer very quickly. I actually had failed the psychological profiling of a terrorist. The center committee of the Red Brigades had judged me too single minded and too opinionated to become a good terrorist. My friend  on the other hand  she was a good terrorist because she was very good at following orders. She also embraced violence. Because she believed that the only way to unblock what  at the time  was known as a blocked democracy  Italy  a country run by the same party for    years was the arms struggle. At the same time  while I was interviewing the Red Brigades  I also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology  but actually was ruled by economics. They were constantly short of cash. They were constantly searching for cash. Now  contrary to what many people believe  terrorism is actually a very expensive business. I'll give you an idea. In the     s  the turnover of the Red Brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars. This is roughly between     and     million  today. Now  you know  if you live underground it's really hard to produce this amount of money. But this also explains why  when I was interviewing the Red Brigades  and then  later on  other arms organizations  including members of al Zarqawi group in the Middle East  everybody was extremely reluctant to talk about ideology  or politics. Because they had no idea. The political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership  which  generally  is never more than five to seven people. All the others do  day in and day out  is search for money. Once  for example  I was interviewing this part timer from the Red Brigades. It was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing. He was a really keen sailor. And he had this beautiful boat. And he told me that the best time of his life was when he was a member of the Red Brigades and he went sailing  every summer  back and forth from Lebanon  where he would pick up Soviet weapons from the PLO  and then carry them all the way to Sardinia where the other arms organization from Europe would go and take their share of the arms. For that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee  which went to fund their organization. So  because I am a trained economist and I think in economic terms  all of the sudden I thought  maybe there is something here. Maybe there is a link  a commercial link  between one organization and another one. But it was only when I interviewed Mario Moretti  the head of the Red Brigades  the man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro  Italian former prime minister  that I finally realized that terrorism is actually business. I was having lunch with him in a high security prison in Italy. And as we were eating  I had the distinct feeling that I was back in the city of London  having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist. This guy thought in the same way I did. So  I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism. Naturally  nobody wanted to fund my research. In fact  I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy. You know  that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money  thinking about the economics of terrorism. So  in the end  I took a decision that  in retrospect  did change my life. I sold my company  and funded the research myself. And what I discovered is this parallel reality  another international economic system  which runs parallel to our own  which has been created by arms organizations since the end of World War II. And what is even more shocking is that this system has followed  step by step  the evolution of our own system  of our Western capitalism. And there are three main stages. The first one is the state sponsor of terrorism. The second one is the privatization of terrorism. And the third  of course  is the globalization of terrorism. So  state sponsor of terrorism  feature of the Cold War. This is when the two superpowers were fighting a war by proxy  along the periphery of the sphere of influence  fully funding arms organizations. A mix of legal and illegal activities is used. So  the link between crime and terror is established very early on. And here is the best example  the Contras in Nicaragua  created by the CIA  legally funded by the U.S. Congress  illegally funded by the Reagan administration via covert operation  for example  the Iran Contra Affair. Then comes the late     s  early '  s  and some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism. So  they gain independence from the sponsor  and start funding themselves. Now  again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities. So  Arafat used to get a percentage of the smuggling of hashish from Bek a Valley  which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria. And the IRA  which control the private transportation system in Northern Ireland  did exactly the same thing. So  every single time that somebody got into a taxi in Belfast without knowing  actually  was funding the IRA. But the great change came  of course  with globalization and deregulation. This is when arms organization were able to link up  also financially  with each other. But above all  they started to do serious business with the world of crime. And together they money laundered their dirty business through the same channel. This is when we see the birth of the transnational arms organization Al Qaeda. This is an organization that can raise money across border. But also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country. Now  deregulation also brought back rogue economics. So what is rogue economics  Rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history. It comes back at times of great transformation  globalization being one of those transformations. It is at this times in which politics actually loses control of the economy  and the economy becomes a rogue force working against us. It has happened before in history. It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire. It has happened with Industrial Revolution. And it actually happened again  with the fall of the Berlin wall. Now  I calculated how big was this international economic system composed by crime  terror  and illegal economy  before     . And it is a staggering  .  trillion dollars. It is trillions  it's not billions. This is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom  soon will be more  considering where this country is going. Now  until       the bulk of all this money flew into the U.S. economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars and the money laundering was taking place inside the United States. The entry point  of course  of most of this money were the off shore facilities. So  this was a vital injection of cash into the U.S. economy. Now  when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply  the U.S. money supply is the amount of dollars that the Federal Reserve prints every year in order to satisfy the increase in the demand for dollars  which  of course  reflects the growth of the economy. So  when I went to look at those figures  I noted that since the late     s a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving the United States  never to come back. These were money taken out in suitcases or in containers  in cash of course. These were money taken out by criminals and money launderers. These were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror  illegal and criminal economy. So  you see  what is the relationship  The United States actually is a country that is the reserve currency of the world. What does it mean  That means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have. It can borrow against the total amount of dollars in circulation in the world. This privilege is called seigniorage. No other country can do that. All the other countries  for example the United Kingdom  can borrow only against the amount of money in circulation inside its own borders. So  here is the implication of the relationship between the worlds of crime  terror  and illegal economy  and our economy. The U.S. in the     s was borrowing against the growth of the terror  illegal and criminal economy. This is how close we are with this world. Now  this situation changed  of course  after       because George Bush launched the War on Terror. Part of the War on Terror was the introduction of the Patriot Act. Now  many of you know that the Patriot Act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of Americans in order to protect them against terrorism. But there is a section of the Patriot Act which refers specifically to finance. And it is  in fact  an anti money laundering legislation. What the Patriot Act did was to prohibit U.S. bank  and U.S. registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off shore facilities. It closed that door between the money laundering in dollars  and the U.S. economy. It also gave the U.S. monetary authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world. Now  you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and banking. All the bankers said to their clients   Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else.  Now  the Euro was a newly born currency of great opportunity for business  and  of course  for investment. And this is what people did. Nobody wants the U.S. monetary authority to check their relationship  to monitor their relationship with their clientele. The same thing happened  of course  in the world of crime and terror. People simply moved their money laundering activities away from the United States into Europe. Why did this happen  This happened because the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation. It was introduced only in the United States. And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars. In Europe  a similar legislation was not introduced. So  within six months Europe became the epicenter of the money laundering activities of the world. So  this is how incredible are the relationship between the world of crime and the world of terror  and our own life. So  why did I tell you this story  I told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers  including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family. You got to question everything that is told to you  including what I just told you today. This is the only way for you to step into the dark side  and have a look at it. And believe me  it's going to be scary. It's going to be frightful  but it's going to enlighten you. And  above all  it's not going to be boring. My name is Ryan Lobo  and I've been involved in the documentary filmmaking business all over the world for the last    years. During the process of making these films I found myself taking photographs  often much to the annoyance of the video cameramen. I found this photography of mine almost compulsive. And at the end of a shoot  I would sometimes feel that I had photographs that told a better story than a sometimes sensational documentary. I felt  when I had my photographs  that I was holding on to something true  regardless of agendas or politics. In       I traveled to three war zones. I traveled to Iraq  Afghanistan and Liberia. And over there I experienced other people's suffering  up close and personal  immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories  and at times I experienced great fear for my own life. As always  I would return to Bangalore  and often to animated discussions at friend's homes  where we would discuss various issues while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings  where a drink often cost more than what they'd paid their    year old maid. I would feel very isolated during these discussions. But at the same time  I questioned myself and my own integrity and purpose in storytelling. And I decided that I had compromised  just like my friends in those discussions  where we told stories in contexts we made excuses for  rather than taking responsibility for. I won't go into details about what led to a decision I made  but let's just say it involved alcohol  cigarettes  other substances and a woman. I basically decided that it was I  not the camera or the network  or anything that lay outside myself  that was the only instrument in storytelling truly worth tuning. In my life  when I tried to achieve things like success or recognition  they eluded me. Paradoxically  when I let go of these objectives  and worked from a place of compassion and purpose  looking for excellence  rather than the results of it  everything arrived on its own  including fulfillment. Photography transcended culture  including my own. And it is  for me  a language which expressed the intangible  and gives voice to people and stories without. I invite you into three recent stories of mine  which are about this way of looking  if you will  which I believe exemplify the tenets of what I like to call compassion in storytelling. In      I went to Liberia  where a group of my friends and I did an independent  self funded film  still in progress  on a very legendary and brutal war lord named General Butt Naked. His real name is Joshua  and he's pictured here in a cell where he once used to torture and murder people  including children. Joshua claims to have personally killed more than        people during Liberia's civil war. He got his name from fighting stark naked. And he is probably the most prolific mass murderer alive on Earth today. This woman witnessed the General murdering her brother. Joshua commanded his child soldiers to commit unspeakable crimes  and enforced his command with great brutality. Today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin  and they are destitute  like these young men in the image. How do you live with yourself if you know you've committed horrific crimes  Today the General is a baptized Christian evangelist. And he's on a mission. We accompanied Joshua  as he walked the Earth  visiting villages where he had once killed and raped. He seeked forgiveness  and he claims to endeavor to improve the lives of his child soldiers. During this expedition I expected him to be killed outright  and us as well. But what I saw opened my eyes to an idea of forgiveness which I never thought possible. In the midst of incredible poverty and loss  people who had nothing absolved a man who had taken everything from them. He begs for forgiveness  and receives it from the same woman whose brother he murdered. Senegalese  the young man seated on the wheelchair here  was once a child soldier  under the General's command  until he disobeyed orders  and the General shot off both his legs. He forgives the General in this image. He risked his life as he walked up to people whose families he'd murdered. In this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him. And Joshua remains silent as they vented their rage against him. This image  to me  is almost like from a Shakespearean play  with a man  surrounded by various influences  desperate to hold on to something true within himself  in a context of great suffering that he has created himself. I was intensely moved during all this. But the question is  does forgiveness and redemption replace justice  Joshua  in his own words  says that he does not mind standing trial for his crimes  and speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia  to an audience that often includes his victims. A very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of separation of church and state. The second story I'm going to tell you about is about a group of very special fighting women with rather unique peace keeping skills. Liberia has been devastated by one of Africa's bloodiest civil wars  which has left more than         people dead  thousands of women scarred by rape and crime on a spectacular scale. Liberia is now home to an all woman United Nations contingent of Indian peacekeepers. These women  many from small towns in India  help keep the peace  far away from home and family. They use negotiation and tolerance more often than an armed response. The commander told me that a woman could gauge a potentially violent situation much better than men. And that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non aggressively. This man was very drunk  and he was very interested in my camera  until he noticed the women  who handled him with smiles  and AK   s at the ready  of course. This contingent seems to be quite lucky  and it has not sustained any casualties  even though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in Liberia. And yes  all of those people killed were male. Many of the women are married with children  and they say the hardest part of their deployment was being kept away from their children. I accompanied these women on their patrols  and watched as they walked past men  many who passed very lewd comments incessantly. And when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response  she said   Don't worry  same thing back home. We know how to deal with these fellows   and ignored them. In a country ravaged by violence against women  Indian peacekeepers have inspired many local women to join the police force. Sometimes  when the war is over and all the film crews have left  the most inspiring stories are the ones that float just beneath the radar. I came back to India and nobody was interested in buying the story. And one editor told me that she wasn't interested in doing what she called  manual labor stories.  In      and      I did stories on the Delhi Fire Service  the DFS  which  during the summer  is probably the world's most active fire department. They answer more than       calls in just two months. And all this against incredible logistical odds  like heat and traffic jams. Something amazing happened during this shoot. Due to a traffic jam  we were late in getting to a slum  a large slum  which had caught fire. As we neared  angry crowds attacked our trucks and stoned them  by hundreds of people all over the place. These men were terrified  as the mob attacked our vehicle. But nonetheless  despite the hostility  firefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire. Running the gauntlet through hostile crowds  and some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury. Some of the local people forcibly took away the hoses from the firemen to put out the fire in their homes. Now  hundreds of homes were destroyed. But the question that lingered in my mind was  what causes people to destroy fire trucks headed to their own homes  Where does such rage come from  And how are we responsible for this     percent of the    million people who live in Delhi live in unauthorized slums  which are chronically overcrowded. They lack even the most basic amenities. And this is something that is common to all our big cities. Back to the DFS. A huge chemical depot caught fire  thousands of drums filled with petrochemicals were blazing away and exploding all around us. The heat was so intense  that hoses were used to cool down firefighters fighting extremely close to the fire  and with no protective clothing. In India we often love to complain about our government bodies. But over here  the heads of the DFS  Mr. R.C. Sharman  Mr. A.K. Sharman  led the firefight with their men. Something wonderful in a country where manual labor is often looked down upon. Over the years  my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested. And I've had very serious doubt about its efficacy  and my own faith in humanity. However  a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel. And when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was with and they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them. Some of the firemen told me that they were also inspired to do better because they were so pleased to get thank yous rather than brick bats. It seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS  at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions  read magazines and whose huts aren't on fire. Sometimes  focusing on what's heroic  beautiful and dignified  regardless of the context  can help magnify these intangibles three ways  in the protagonist of the story  in the audience  and also in the storyteller. And that's the power of storytelling. Focus on what's dignified  courageous and beautiful  and it grows. Thank you. So  now  there are a lot of web  .  consultants who make a lot of money. In fact  they make their livings on this kind of stuff. I'm going to try and save you all the time and all the money and go through it in the next three minutes  so bear with me. Started a website back in       with a few friends of mine  called Reddit.com. That's what you'd call a social news website. Basically all that means is that the democratic front page is the best stuff on the web. You find some interesting content  say a TEDTalk  submit it to Reddit  and the community of your peers will vote it up if they like it  vote it down if they don't. And that creates the front page. It's always rising  falling  always changing. About a half million people visit every day. But this isn't about Reddit. This is actually about discovering new things that pop up on the web. Because in the last four years we've seen all kinds of memes  all kinds of trends get born right on our front page. But this isn't even about Reddit itself. It's actually about humpback whales. Well  okay  technically it's actually about Greenpeace  which is an environmental organization that wanted to stop the Japanese government on their whaling campaign. These humpback whales were getting killed. They wanted to put an end to it. And one of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of these humpback whales. But to really kind of personify the movement  they wanted to name it. So  in true web fashion they put together a poll where they had a bunch of very erudite  very thoughtful  cultured names. I believe this is a Farsi word for  immortal.  I think this means  divine power of the ocean  in a Polynesian language. And then there was this  Mister Splashy Pants. And this  this was special. Mister Pants  or Splashy  to his friends  was very popular on the Internet. In fact  someone on Reddit thought   Oh  what a great thing  we should all vote this up.  And  you know  Redditors responded and all agreed. So  the voting started and we actually got behind it ourselves. We changed our logo  for the day  from the alien to a Splashy  to sort of help the cause. And it wasn't long before other sites like Fark and Boing Boing and the rest of the Internet started saying   Yes  We love Splashy Pants.  So  it went from about five percent  which was when this meme started  to    percent at the end of voting. Which is pretty impressive right  We won  Mister Splashy Pants was chosen. Hmm  just kidding. Okay. So  Greenpeace actually wasn't that crazy about it  because they wanted one of their more thoughtful names to win. So they said   No  no  just kidding. We'll give it another week of voting.  Well  that got us a little angry. So  we changed it to Fightin' Splashy. And the Reddit community  really  and the rest of the internet  rather  really got behind this. Facebook groups were getting created. Facebook applications were getting created. The idea was   Vote your conscience   vote for Mister Splashy Pants. And people were putting up signs in the real world    And this was the final vote. When all was cleared ...    percent of the votes  and to give you an idea of the landslide  the next highest name pulled in three. Okay  So  there was a clear lesson here. And that was that the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants. Which is obvious. It's a great name. Everyone wants to hear their news anchor say   Mister Splashy Pants.  And I think that's what helped drive this. But what was cool was that the repercussions now for Greenpeace was  they created an entire marketing campaign around it. They sell Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins. They even created an e card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy. But what was even more important was the fact that they actually accomplished their mission. The Japanese government called off their whaling expedition. Mission accomplished. Greenpeace was thrilled. The whales were happy. That's a quote. And actually  Redditors in the Internet community were happy to participate  but they weren't whale lovers. A few of them certainly were. But we're talking about a lot of people who were just really interested and really caught up in this great meme  and in fact someone from Greenpeace came back on the site and thanked Reddit for its participation. But this wasn't really out of altruism. This was just out of interest in doing something cool. And this is kind of how the Internet works. This is that great big secret. Because the Internet provides this level playing field. Your link is just as good as your link  which is just as good as my link. As long as we have a browser  anyone can get to any website no matter how big a budget you have. That is  as long as you can keep net neutrality in place. The other important thing is that it costs nothing to get that content online now. There are so many great publishing tools that are available  it only takes a few minutes of your time now to actually produce something. And the cost of iteration is so cheap that you might as well give it a go. And if you do  be genuine about it. Be honest. Be up front. And one of the great lessons that Greenpeace actually learned was that it's okay to lose control. It's okay to take yourself a little less seriously  given that  even though it's a very serious cause  you could ultimately achieve your final goal. And that's the final message that I want to share with all of you    that you can do well online. But no longer is the message going to be coming from just the top down. If you want to succeed you've got to be okay to just lose control. Thank you. Actually  I come from Britain  but I've been living in Maldives for    years now. So  that's home really. The Maldives  as I'm sure you're aware  are a chain of islands off the southwest coast of India here. Capital  Mal   where I live. Actually  sitting here today in Mysore  we're closer to Mal  than we are to Delhi  for example. If you're in IT  India  obviously  is the place to be at the moment. But if you're a marine biologist  Maldives is not such a bad place to be. And it has been my home these years. For those of you who've been there  fantastic coral reefs  fantastic diving  fantastic snorkeling. I spend as much of my time as possible investigating the marine life. I study fish  also the bigger things  whales and dolphins. This is a blue whale. We have blue whales in the waters around here  off Maldives  around the waters of India. You can see them off Kerala. And  in fact  we're very lucky in this region. One of the best places in the world to see blue whales is here in this region. In Sri Lanka  if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka  during the northeast monsoon season  you can see blue whales very  very easily. It's probably the best place in the world to see them. Now  when I talk about the northeast monsoon season  I'm sure many of you here know exactly what I mean  but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure. I need to explain a little bit about monsoons. Now  monsoon  the root of the word  monsoon  comes from the word  season.  So  it's just a season. And there are two seasons in most of South Asia. And in the summer India heats up  gets very hot. Hot air rises  and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it. And the way it works is  it comes from the southwest. It comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India. So it comes from the southwest. It's a southwest monsoon. Picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean. That's what brings the monsoon rain. And then in the winter things cool down. High pressure builds over India. And the whole system goes into reverse. So  the wind is now coming from the northeast out of India  across the Indian Ocean  this way towards Africa. Keep that in mind. Now  I'm a marine biologist  but I'm actually a bit of an old fashioned naturalist  I suppose. I'm interested in all sorts of things  almost everything that moves  including dragonflies. And I'm actually going to talk  this afternoon  about dragonflies. This is a very beautiful species  it's called the Oriental Scarlet. And one thing you need to know about dragonflies  one important thing  is that they lay their eggs in fresh water. They need fresh water to breed. They lay the eggs into fresh water. Little larvae hatch out in fresh water. They feed on other little things. They feed on mosquito larvae. So  they're very important. They control mosquito larvae  among other things. And they grow and grow by stages. And they climb out of the water  burst out  as the adult which we see. And typically  there is a lot of variation  but if you have a dragonfly with  say  a one year life cycle  which is quite typical  the larva  living in the fresh water  lives for    or    months. And then the adult  which comes after  lives for one or two months. So it's essentially a freshwater animal. It really does need fresh water. Now  the particular species of dragonfly I want to talk about is this one  because most dragonflies  like the one we've just seen  when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life  it doesn't go very far. It can't travel very far. A few kilometers  maybe  is quite typical. They are very good fliers  but they don't go too far. But this guy is an exception. And this is called the Globe Skimmer  or Wandering Glider. And  as the name might suggest  it is found pretty much around the world. It lives throughout the tropics  the Americas  Africa  Asia  Australia  into the Pacific. And it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it. But it really hasn't been studied very much. It's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly. If you're going to study dragonflies  you want to study those really bright beautiful ones  like that red one. Or the really rare ones  the endemic endangered ones. This is  it seems a bit dull you know. It's sort of dull colored. And it's fairly common. And it occurs everywhere    you know  why bother  But if you take that attitude  you're actually missing something rather special. Because this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell. And I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it living in the Maldives. When I first went to the Maldives  dead keen on diving  spent as much of my time as I could in and under the water. Didn't notice any dragonflies  maybe they were there  maybe they weren't. Didn't notice them. But after some time  after some months  one day as I was going out and about  suddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies  hundreds of dragonflies. Something like this  these are all this species Globe Skimmer. I didn't know at the time  but I know now  they're Globe Skimmers  hundreds of them. And they were there for some time. And then they were gone. And I didn't think anything more of it until the following year  when it happened again  and then the year after that  and then the year after that. And I was a bit slow  I didn't really take too much notice. But I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues  and yes they come every year. And I asked people about them and yes  they knew  but they didn't know anything  where they came from  or anything. And again I didn't think too much of it. But slowly it began to dawn on me that something rather special was happening. Because dragonflies need fresh water to breed. And the Maldives  and I'm sure some of you have been there    so here is home. So  Maldives  beautiful place. It's built entirely of coral reefs. And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks. Average height  about that much above sea level. So  global warming  sea level rise  it's a real serious issue. But I'm not going to talk about that. Another important point of these sand banks is that when it rains  the rainwater soaks down into the soil. So  it's gone. So  it stays under the soil. The trees can put their roots into it. Humans can dig holes and make a well. But dragonflies    a bit tricky. There is no surface fresh water. There are no ponds  streams  rivers  lakes  nothing like that. So  why is it that every year millions of dragonflies  millions  millions of dragonflies turn up  I got a little bit curious. In fact I'll stop here  because I want to ask  and there is a lot of people who  from India of course  people who grew up spending your childhood here. Those of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here  let me have a show of hands  who of you    not yet  not yet  You're too keen. You're too keen. No. Hang on. Hang on. Wait for the go. I'll say go. Those of you who grew up in India  do you remember in your childhood  dragonflies  swarms of dragonflies  Maybe at school  maybe tying little bits of string onto them  Maybe pulling bits off  I'm not asking about that. You've only got to say  do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies. Any hands  Any hands  Yes. Thank you. Thank you. It's a widespread phenomenon throughout South Asia  including the Maldives. And I got a bit curious about it. In the Maldives    now  in India there is plenty of water  so  dragonflies  yeah  of course. Why not  But in Maldives  no fresh water. So  what on Earth is going on  And the first thing I did was started recording when they turned up in the Maldives. And there is the answer    st of October. Not every year  that's the average date. So  I've been writing it down for    years now. You'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place. But in October  remember  we're still in southwest monsoon  Maldives is still in the southwest monsoon. But wind is  invariably  every time  is from the west. It's going towards India  not from India. So  are these things  how are these things getting here  Are they coming from India against the wind  Seemed a bit unlikely. So  next thing I did is I got on the phone. Maldives is a long archipelago. It stretches about     miles  of course it's India here. I got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues. When do you see the dragonflies appear  And pretty soon  a picture started emerging. In Bangalore  a colleague there sent me information for three years  average    th of September  so late September. Down in Trivandrum  a bit later. Far north of Maldives  a bit later. Then Mal   then further south. And then the southernmost Maldives. It's pretty obvious  they're coming from India. But they are coming     miles across the ocean  against the wind. How on Earth are they doing that  I didn't know. The next thing I did was I started counting dragonflies. I wanted to know about their seasonality  what time of year  this is when they first arrive  but how long are they around for  Does that give any clues  So  I started a very rigorous scientific process. I had a rigorous scientific transect. I got on my bicycle  and I cycled around the island of Mal . It's about five kilometers around  counting the dragonflies as I go  trying not to bump into people as I'm looking in the trees. And they're here for a very short time  October  November  December. That's it. And then they tail off  there's a few  but that's it. October  November  December. That is not the northeast monsoon season. That's not the southwest season. That's the inter monsoon  the time when the monsoon changes. Now  what I said was  you get the southwest monsoon going one way  and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way. And that sort of gives the impression you've got one air mass going up and down  up and down. It doesn't work like that. What happens  actually  is there is two air masses. And there is a front between them  and the front moves. So  if you've got India here  when the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon. Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon. And that front in the middle is not vertical  it's at an angle. So  as it comes over towards Mal  I'm standing in Mal  underneath the front. I can be in the southwest monsoon. But the wind above is from the northeast monsoon. So  the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon  but at an altitude at       to       meters up in the air. Incredible. These little insects  it's the same ones we see out here  in India   two inches long  five centimeters long  flying in their millions      miles across the ocean  at       meters up. Quite incredible. So  I was quite pleased with myself. I thought wow  I've tracked this one  I know how they come here. Then I scratched my head a bit  and that's okay  I know how they come here  but why do they come here  What are millions of dragonflies doing  flying out over the ocean every year to their apparent doom  It doesn't make sense. There is nothing for them in Maldives. What on Earth are they doing  Well  to cut a long story short  they're actually flying right across the ocean. They're making it all the way across to East Africa. I know that because I have friends who work on fisheries' research vessels who have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean. I know because we have reports from Seychelles  which fit in as well  down here. And I know because when you look at the rainfall  these particular insects  these Globe Skimmers breed in temporary rain water pools. Okay  they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are  the monsoon rains. The larvae have to develop very quickly. They only take six weeks. Instead of    months  they're six weeks. They're up  and they're off. Now  here we have  in case you can't read at the back  the top is rainfall for India. And we're starting in June. So this is the monsoon rain. By September  October  it's drying out. Nothing for these dragonflies. There is no more seasonal rain. They've got to go hunting for seasonal rain. And they fly south. As the monsoon withdraws to the south they come down through Karnataka  into Kerala. And then they run out of land. But they are incredibly good fliers. This particular species  it can fly for thousands of kilometers. And it just keeps going. And the wind  the northeast wind swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa  where it's raining. And they are breeding in the rains of Africa. Now  this is southeast Africa. It makes it look like there are sort of two breeding periods here. It's slightly more complicated than that. What's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here. And the dragonflies you can see today outside here  on the campus  are the young of this generation. They hatched out in India. They're looking for somewhere to breed. If it rains here they'll breed. But most of them are going to carry on. And next stop  perhaps only four or five days away is going to be East Africa. The wind will swoosh them out across here. If they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look  nothing there  they'll carry on. Here  here  Kenya  East Africa  they've actually just come out of a long drought. Just last week the rains broke. The short rains broke and it's raining there now. And the dragonflies are there. I have reports from my various contacts. The dragonflies are here now. They're breeding there. When those guys  they'll lay their eggs now. They'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time the seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there  it's down here. They'll fly down here. And the clever thing is the wind is always converging to where the rain is. The rain occurs  these are summer rains. This is a summer monsoon. The sun is overhead there. Summer rains in southern Africa. The sun is overhead  maximum heating  maximum evaporation  maximum clouds  maximum rainfall  maximum opportunities for reproduction. Not only that  because you have this convection  you have this rising of the air where it's hot  air is drawn in. There's a convergence. So  wherever the rain is falling  the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising. So  the little fellow that hatches out here  he gets up into the air  he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling. Lay their eggs  next generation  they come up  automatically carried to where the rain is falling. It's now back there. They come out  it's time to come back. So  in four generations  one  two  three  four and then back. A complete circuit of the Indian Ocean. This is a circuit of about        kilometers.        kilometers  four generations  mind you  for a two inch long insect. It's quite incredible. Those of you from North America will be familiar with the Monarch butterfly. Which  up until now has had the longest known insect migration. It's only half the length of this one. And this crossing here  of the ocean  is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing of any insect. A quite incredible feat. And I only stumbled on this because I was living in Mal   in Maldives for long enough for it to percolate into my brain that something rather special was going on. But dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing. There is more to the story. I'm also interested in birds. And I'm familiar with this fellow. This is a rather special bird. It's a falcon. It's called the eastern red footed falcon  obviously. But it's also called the Amur Falcon. And it's called the Amur Falcon because it breeds in Amurland. Which is an area along the Amur River  which is up here. It's the border  much of it is the border between China and Russia  up here in the far east. So  Siberia  Manchuria. And that's where it breeds. And if you're a falcon it's quite a nice place to be in the summer. But it's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter. It's  well  you can imagine. So  as any sensible bird would do  he moves south. They move south. The whole population moves south. But then the being sensible stopped. So  now they don't stop here  or even down here. No  they turn across here. They have a little refueling stop in northeastern India. They come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa. And then they strike out across the ocean  down to Kenya. And down here  and they winter down here  in southern Africa . Incredible. This is the most extraordinary migration of any bird of prey. A quite incredible migration. And they are not the only one that makes the crossing. They have the most incredible journey  but several make the crossing from India to Africa. Includes this one  the hobby. This fellow is a very nice bird  this is the Pied cuckoo. Those of you from northern India will be familiar with this. It comes with the monsoons. This time of year they cross back to Africa. And this guy  the roller  a rather beautiful bird. It's known as the Eurasian Roller. In India it occurs in the northwest  so it's known as the Kashmir Roller. And these birds  what I've done is I've complied all the records  all the available records of these birds  put them together  and found out they migrate at exactly the same time as the dragonflies. They make use of exactly the same winds. They travel at exactly the same time with the same winds to make the crossing. I know they travel at the same altitude. It's known about the Amur Falcon. This guy  unfortunately  one of these met an unfortunate end. He was flying off the coast of Goa     years ago      . October      . An Indian Navy jet was flying off Goa  bang  In the middle of the night. Fortunately  a two engine jet got back to base  and they pulled the remains of one of these  Eurasian Rollers  out. Flying at night over the Indian Ocean       meters. Same height as the dragonflies go. So  they are using the same winds. And the other thing  the other important factor for all these birds  all medium sized fellows  and this includes the next slide as well  which is a bee eater. Bee eaters eat bees. This one has a nice blue cheek. It's a Blue cheeked Bee eater. And every one of these birds that makes the crossing from India to East Africa eats insects  large insects  the size of dragonflies. Thank you very much. Metaphor lives a secret life all around us. We utter about six metaphors a minute. Metaphorical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves and others  how we communicate  learn  discover and invent. But metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words. Now  to assist me in explaining this  I've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers  the reigning king of the metaphorians  a man whose contributions to the field are so great that he himself has become a metaphor. I am  of course  referring to none other than Elvis Presley. Now   All Shook Up  is a great love song. It's also a great example of how whenever we deal with anything abstract    ideas  emotions  feelings  concepts  thoughts    we inevitably resort to metaphor. In  All Shook Up   a touch is not a touch  but a chill. Lips are not lips  but volcanoes. She is not she  but a buttercup. And love is not love  but being all shook up. In this  Elvis is following Aristotle's classic definition of metaphor as the process of giving the thing a name that belongs to something else. This is the mathematics of metaphor. And fortunately it's very simple. X equals Y. This formula works wherever metaphor is present. Elvis uses it  but so does Shakespeare in this famous line from  Romeo and Juliet   Juliet is the sun. Now  here  Shakespeare gives the thing  Juliet  a name that belongs to something else  the sun. But whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else  we give it a whole network of analogies too. We mix and match what we know about the metaphor's source  in this case the sun  with what we know about its target  Juliet. And metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet than if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like. So  how do we make and understand metaphors  This might look familiar. The first step is pattern recognition. Look at this image. What do you see  Three wayward Pac Men  and three pointy brackets are actually present. What we see  however  are two overlapping triangles. Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns  it is the creation of patterns. Second step  conceptual synesthesia. Now  synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ in another sense organ as well  such as colored hearing. People with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters. We all have synesthetic abilities. This is the Bouba Kiki test. What you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called Bouba  and which is called Kiki. If you are like    percent of other people  you will identify the round  amoeboid shape as Bouba  and the sharp  spiky one as Kiki. Can we do a quick show of hands  Does that correspond  Okay  I think   .  would about cover it. Why do we do that  Because we instinctively find  or create  a pattern between the round shape and the round sound of Bouba  and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki. And many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic. Silence is sweet. Neckties are loud. Sexually attractive people are hot. Sexually unattractive people leave us cold. Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia  in which we understand one concept in the context of another. Third step is cognitive dissonance. This is the Stroop test. What you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the ink in which these words are printed. You can take the test now. If you're like most people  you will experience a moment of cognitive dissonance when the name of the color is printed in a differently colored ink. The test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer. Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well. The participants had to identify  as quickly as possible  the literally false sentences. They took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences. Why  Because we cannot ignore the metaphorical meaning of words either. One of the sentences was   Some jobs are jails.  Now  unless you're a prison guard  the sentence  Some jobs are jails  is literally false. Sadly  it's metaphorically true. And the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability to identify it as literally false. Metaphor matters because it's around us every day  all the time. Metaphor matters because it creates expectations. Pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news. Agent metaphors describe price movements as the deliberate action of a living thing  as in   The NASDAQ climbed higher.  Object metaphors describe price movements as non living things  as in   The Dow fell like a brick.  Researchers asked a group of people to read a clutch of market commentaries  and then predict the next day's price trend. Those exposed to agent metaphors had higher expectations that price trends would continue. And they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal. If  for example  house prices are routinely described as climbing and climbing  higher and higher  people might naturally assume that that rise is unstoppable. They may feel confident  say  in taking out mortgages they really can't afford. That's a hypothetical example of course. But this is how metaphor misleads. Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions by activating analogies. A group of students was told that a small democratic country had been invaded and had asked the U.S. for help. And they had to make a decision. What should they do  Intervene  appeal to the U.N.  or do nothing  They were each then given one of three descriptions of this hypothetical crisis. Each of which was designed to trigger a different historical analogy  World War II  Vietnam  and the third was historically neutral. Those exposed to the World War II scenario made more interventionist recommendations than the others. Just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words  we cannot ignore the analogies that are triggered by metaphor. Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery. Whenever we solve a problem  or make a discovery  we compare what we know with what we don't know. And the only way to find out about the latter is to investigate the ways it might be like the former. Einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play. He famously used thought experiments  which are essentially elaborate analogies  to come up with some of his greatest discoveries. By bringing together what we know and what we don't know through analogy  metaphorical thinking strikes the spark that ignites discovery. Now metaphor is ubiquitous  yet it's hidden. But you just have to look at the words around you and you'll find it. Ralph Waldo Emerson described language as  fossil poetry.  But before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor. And these fossils still breathe. Take the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy   Cogito ergo sum.  That's routinely translated as   I think  therefore I am.  But there is a better translation. The Latin word  cogito  is derived from the prefix  co   meaning  together   and the verb  agitare   meaning  to shake.  So  the original meaning of  cogito  is to shake together. And the proper translation of  cogito ergo sum  is  I shake things up  therefore I am.  Metaphor shakes things up  giving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process. The mind is a plastic snow dome  the most beautiful  most interesting  and most itself  when  as Elvis put it  it's all shook up. And metaphor keeps the mind shaking  rattling and rolling  long after Elvis has left the building. Thank you very much. The anger in me against corruption made me to make a big career change last year  becoming a full time practicing lawyer. My experiences over the last    months  as a lawyer  has seeded in me a new entrepreneurial idea  which I believe is indeed worth spreading. So  I share it with all of you here today  though the idea itself is getting crystallized and I'm still writing up the business plan. Of course it helps that fear of public failure diminishes as the number of ideas which have failed increases. I've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship since     . I've explored  experienced  and experimented enterprise and capitalism to my heart's content. I built  along with my two brothers  the leading real estate company in my home state  Kerala  and then worked professionally with two of India's biggest businessmen  but in their startup enterprises. In       when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector to work on so called social sector issues  I definitely did not have any grand strategy or plan to pursue and find for profit solutions to addressing pressing public issues. When life brought about a series of death and near death experiences within my close circle  which highlighted the need for an emergency medical response service in India  similar to     in USA. To address this  I  along with four friends  founded Ambulance Access for All  to promote life support ambulance services in India. For those from the developing world  there is nothing  absolutely nothing new in this idea. But as we envisioned it  we had three key goals  Providing world class life support ambulance service which is fully self sustainable from its own revenue streams  and universally accessible to anyone in a medical emergency  irrespective of the capability to pay. The service which grew out of this  Dial      for Ambulance  with one ambulance in       now has a hundred plus ambulances in three states  and has transported over         patients and victims since inception. The service is     Applause  fully self sustainable from its own revenues  without accessing any public funds  and the cross subsidy model actually works  where the rich pays higher  poor pays lower  and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge. The service responded effectively and efficiently  during the unfortunate       Mumbai terror attacks. And as you can see from the visuals  the service was responding and rescuing victims from the incident locations even before the police could cordon off the incident locations and formally confirm it as a terror strike. We ended up being the first medical response team in every incident location and transported     victims  saving life. In tribute and remembrance of       attacks over the last one year  we have actually helped a Pakistani NGO  Aman Foundation  to set up a self sustainable life support ambulance service in Karachi  facilitated by Acumen Fund. It's a small message from us  in our own small way to the enemies of humanity  of Islam  of South Asia  of India  and of Pakistan  that humanity will continue to bloom  irrespective of such dastardly attacks. Since then I've also co founded two other social enterprises. One is Education Access for All  setting up schools in small town India. And the other is Moksha Yug Access  which is integrating rural supply chain on the foundations of self help group based microfinance. I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right. Because diligent investors and venture funds have committed over  .  million dollars in funding. With the significance being these funds have come in as a QT capital  not as grant or as philanthropy. Now I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that I'm exploring. Corruption  bribes  and lack of transparency. You may be surprised to know that eight speakers yesterday actually mentioned these terms in their talks. Bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side  with the supply side being mostly of greedy corporate unethical businesses and hapless common man. And the demand side being mostly politicians  bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power vested with them. According to World Bank estimate  one trillion dollars is paid in bribes every year  worsening the condition of the already worse off. Yet  if you analyze the common man  he or she does not wake up every day and say   Hmm  let me see who I can pay a bribe to today.  or   Let me see who I can corrupt today.  Often it is the constraining or the back to the wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe. In the modern day world  where time is premium and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough  the hapless common man simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life. Now  let me ask you another question. Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day to day life to get something done. What do you do  Of course you can call the police. But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption  Most definitely you don't want to pay the bribe. But you also don't have the time  resources  expertise or wherewithal to fight this. Unfortunately  many of us in this room are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces. Yet the market forces around the world have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in  pay a fee  and fight the demand for a bribe. Like a bribe buster service  or       Fight Bribes  or www.stopbribes.org or www.preventcorruption.org. Such a service simply do not exist. One image that has haunted me from my early business days is of a grandmother     plus years  being harassed by the bureaucrats in the town planning office. All she needed was permission to build three steps to her house  from ground level  making it easier for her to enter and exit her house. Yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit for want of a bribe. Even though it pricked my conscience then  I could not  or rather I did not tend to her or assist her  because I was busy building my real estate company. I don't want to be haunted by such images any more. A group of us have been working on a pilot basis to address individual instances of demands for bribes for common services or entitlement. And in all    cases where we have pushed back such demands using existing and legitimate tools like the Right to Information Act  video  audio  or peer pressure  we have successfully obtained whatever our clients set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe. And with the cost of these tools being substantially lower than the bribe demanded. I believe that these tools that worked in these    pilot cases can be consolidated in standard processes in a BPO kind of environment  and made available on web  call center and franchise physical offices  for a fee  to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe. The target market is as tempting as it can get. It can be worth up to one trillion dollars  being paid in bribes every year  or equal to India's GDP. And it is an absolutely virgin market. I propose to explore this idea further  to examine the potential of creating a for profit  fee based BPO kind of service to stop bribes and prevent corruption. I do realize that the fight for justice against corruption is never easy. It never has been and it never will be. In my last    months as a lawyer  battling small  and large scale corruption  including the one perpetrated by India's biggest corporate scamster. Through his charities I have had three police cases filed against me alleging trespass  impersonation and intimidation. The battle against corruption exacts a toll on ourselves  our families  our friends  and even our kids. Yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place. What gives us the courage  As my close friend replied  when told during the seeding days of the ambulance project that it is an impossible task and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue chip jobs  I quote   Of course we cannot fail in this  at least in our own minds. For we are insane people  trying to do an impossible task. And an insane person does not know what an impossible task is.  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Shaffi  that is a really exciting business idea. Shaffi Mather  I just have to get through the initial days where I don't get eliminated. CA  What's on your mind  I mean  give us a sense of the numbers here    a typical bribe and a typical fee. I mean  what's in your head  SM  So let me ... Let me give you an example. Somebody who had applied for the passport. The officer was just sitting on it and was demanding around       rupees in bribes. And he did not want to pay. So we actually used the Right to Information Act  which is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States  and pushed back the officers in this particular case. And in all these    cases  when we kept pushing them back  there was three kinds of reaction. A set of people actually say   Oh  let me just grant it to them  and run away from it.  Some people actually come back and say   Oh  you want to screw me. Let me show you what I can do.  And he will push us back. So you take the next step  or use the next tool available in what we are putting together  and then he relents. By the third time  in all    cases  we have achieved success. CA  But if it's a       rupee     dollar bribe  what fee would you have to charge  and can you actually make the business work  SM  Well  actually the cost that we incurred was less than     rupees. So  it actually works. CA  That's a high gross margin business. I like it. SM  I actually did not want to answer this on the TED stage. CA  OK  so these are provisional numbers  no pricing guarantee. If you can pull this off  you will be a global hero. I mean  this could be huge. Thank you so much for sharing this idea at TED. The key question is   When are we going to get fusion   It's really been a long time since we've known about fusion. We've known about fusion since       when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington and the British Association for the Advancement of Science conjectured that that's why the sun shines. I've always been very worried about resource. I don't know about you  but when my mother gave me food  I always sorted the ones I disliked from the ones I liked. And I ate the disliked ones first  because the ones you like  you want to save. And as a child you're always worried about resource. And once it was sort of explained to me how fast we were using up the world's resources  I got very upset  about as upset as I did when I realized that the Earth will only last about five billion years before it's swallowed by the sun. Big events in my life  a strange child. Energy  at the moment  is dominated by resource. The countries that make a lot of money out of energy have something underneath them. Coal powered industrial revolution in this country    oil  gas  sorry. Gas  I'm probably the only person who really enjoys it when Mister Putin turns off the gas tap  because my budget goes up. We're really dominated now by those things that we're using up faster and faster and faster. And as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty in the Third World  in the developing world  we're using energy faster and faster. And those resources are going away. And the way we'll make energy in the future is not from resource  it's really from knowledge. If you look    years into the future  the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three  with some wind  with some other things  but these are going to be the base load energy drivers. Solar can do it  and we certainly have to develop solar. But we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply for the world. Fission. Our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations. They're going to put in six new nuclear power stations  and probably more after that. China is building nuclear power stations. Everybody is. Because they know that that is one sure way to do carbon free energy. But if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is  the perfect energy source is one that doesn't take up much space  has a virtually inexhaustible supply  is safe  doesn't put any carbon into the atmosphere  doesn't leave any long lived radioactive waste  it's fusion. But there is a catch. Of course there is always a catch in these cases. Fusion is very hard to do. We've been trying for    years. Okay. What is fusion  Here comes the nuclear physics. And sorry about that  but this is what turns me on. I was a strange child. Nuclear energy comes for a simple reason. The most stable nucleus is iron  right in the middle of the periodic table. It's a medium sized nucleus. And you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy. So  uranium  which is very big  wants to split. But small atoms want to join together  small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron. And you can get energy out this way. And indeed that's exactly what stars do. In the middle of stars  you're joining hydrogen together to make helium and then helium together to make carbon  to make oxygen  all the things that you're made of are made in the middle of stars. But it's a hard process to do because  as you know  the middle of a star is quite hot  almost by definition. And there is one reaction that's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do. It's between two isotopes of hydrogen  two kinds of hydrogen  deuterium  which is heavy hydrogen  which you can get from seawater  and tritium which is super heavy hydrogen. These two nuclei  when they're far apart  are charged. And you push them together and they repel. But when you get them close enough  something called the strong force starts to act and pulls them together. So  most of the time they repel. You get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point the strong force grips them together. For a moment they become helium    because they've got five particles inside them. So  that's that process there. Deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium  . Helium splits out  and a neutron comes out and lots of energy comes out. If you can get something to about     million degrees  things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration  this will happen  and it will release energy. And that energy is what powers fusion. And it's this reaction that we want to do. There is one trickiness about this reaction. Well  there is a trickiness that you have to make it     million degrees  but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet. It's pretty hot. The trickiness about the reaction is that tritium doesn't exist in nature. You have to make it from something else. And you make if from lithium. That reaction at the bottom  that's lithium    plus a neutron  will give you more helium  plus tritium. And that's the way you make your tritium. But fortunately  if you can do this fusion reaction  you've got a neutron  so you can make that happen. Now  why the hell would we bother to do this  This is basically why we would bother to do it. If you just plot how much fuel we've got left  in units of present world consumption. And as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil    the blue line  by the way  is the lowest estimate of existing resources. And the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate. And as you go across there you will see that we've got a few tens of years  and perhaps     years of fossil fuels left. And god knows we don't really want to burn all of it  because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air. And then we get to uranium. And with current reactor technology we really don't have very much uranium. And we will have to extract uranium from sea water  which is the yellow line  to make conventional nuclear power stations actually do very much for us. This is a bit shocking  because in fact our government is relying on that for us to meet Kyoto  and do all those kind of things. To go any further you would have to have breeder technology. And breeder technology is fast breeders. And that's pretty dangerous. The big thing  on the right  is the lithium we have in the world. And lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line. And we have    million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water. Everybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion. Is it cost competitive  We make estimates of what we think it would cost to actually make a fusion power plant. And we get within about the same price as current electricity. So  how would we make it  We have to hold something at     million degrees. And  in fact  we've done this. We hold it with a magnetic field. And inside it  right in the middle of this toroidal shape  doughnut shape  right in the middle is     million degrees. It boils away in the middle at     million degrees. And in fact we can make fusion happen. And just down the road  this is JET. It's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion. When people say fusion is    years away  and always will be  I say   Yeah  but we've actually done it.  Right  We can do fusion. In the center of this device we made    megawatts of fusion power in     . And in      we're going to fire it up again and break all those records. But that's not really fusion power. That's just making some fusion happen. We've got to take that  we've got to make that into a fusion reactor. Because we want    million years worth of fusion power for the Earth. This is the device we're building now. It gets very expensive to do this research. It turns out you can't do fusion on a table top despite all that cold fusion nonsense. Right  You can't. You have to do it in a very big device. More than half the world's population is involved in building this device in southern France  which is a nice place to put an experiment. Seven nations are involved in building this. It's going to cost us    billion. And we'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power. But that's not electricity yet. We have to get to this. We have to get to a power plant. We have to start putting electricity on the grid in this very complex technology. And I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is. But at the moment  all we can imagine is sometime in the     s. I wish this were different. We really need it now. We're going to have a problem with power in the next five years in this country. So      looks like an infinity away. But we can't abandon it now  we have to push forward  get fusion to happen. I wish we had more money  I wish we had more resources. But this is what we're aiming at  sometime in the     s    real electric power from fusion. Thank you very much. Namaste. Salaam. Shalom. Sat Sri Akal. Greetings to all of you from Pakistan. It is often said that we fear that which we do not know. And Pakistan  in this particular vein  is very similar. Because it has provoked  and does provoke  a visceral anxiety in the bellies of many a Western soul  especially when viewed through the monochromatic lens of turbulence and turmoil. But there are many other dimensions to Pakistan. And what follows is a stream of images  a series of images captured by some of Pakistan's most dynamic and young photographers  that aims to give you an alternative glimpse  a look inside the hearts and minds of some ordinary Pakistani citizens. Here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you. My name is Abdul Khan. I come from Peshawar. I hope that you will be able to see not just my Taliban like beard  but also the richness and color of my perceptions  aspirations and dreams  as rich and colorful as the satchels that I sell. My name is Meher and this is my friend Irim. I hope to become a vet when I grow up so that I can take care of stray cats and dogs who wander around the streets of the village that I live near Gilgit  northern Pakistan. My name is Kailash. And I like to enrich lives through technicolored glass. Madame  would you like some of those orange bangles with the pink polka dots  My name is Zamin. And I'm an IDP  an internally displaced person  from Swat. Do you see me on the other side of this fence  Do I matter  or really exist for you  My name is Iman. I am a fashion model  an up and coming model from Lahore. Do you see me simply smothered in cloth  Or can you move beyond my veil and see me for who I truly am inside  My name is Ahmed. I am an Afghan refugee from the Khyber agency. I have come from a place of intense darkness. And that is why I want to illuminate the world. My name is Papusay. My heart and drum beat as one. If religion is the opium of the masses  then for me  music is my one and only ganja. A rising tide lifts all boats. And the rising tide of India's spectacular economic growth has lifted over     million Indians into a buoyant middle class. But there are still over     million Indians  Pakistanis  Sri Lankans  Bangladeshis  Nepalese  who remain washed up on the shores of poverty. Therefore as India and Pakistan  as you and I  it behooves us to transcend our differences  to celebrate our diversity  to leverage our common humanity. Our collective vision at Naya Jeevan  which for many of you  as you all recognize  means  new life  in Urdu and Hindi  is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families by providing them with affordable access to catastrophic health care. Indeed it is the emerging world's first HMO for the urban working poor. Why should we do this as Indians and Pakistanis  We are but two threads cut from the same cloth. And if our fates are intertwined  then we believe that it is good karma  it is good fortune. And for many of us  our fortunes do indeed lie at the bottom of the pyramid. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Fantastic. Just stay up here. That was fantastic. I found that really moving. You know  we fought hard to get at least a small Pakistani contingent to come. It felt like it was really important. They went through a lot to get here. Would the Pakistanis please just stand up please  I just really wanted to acknowledge you. Thank you so much. Well  I learned a lot of things about ballooning  especially at the end of these balloon flights around the world I did with Brian Jones. When I took this picture  the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night. And on the other side there was a rising sun. So  you see that on the other side of ice you have the unknown  you have the non obvious  you have the non seen  for the people who don't dare to go through the ice. There are so many people who prefer to suffer in the ice they know instead of taking the risk of going through the ice to see what there is on the other side. And I think that's one of the main problems of our society. We learn  maybe not the famous TED audience  but so many other people learn  that the unknown  the doubts  the question marks are dangerous. And we have to resist to the changes. We have to keep everything under control. Well  the unknown is part of life. And in that sense  ballooning is a beautiful metaphor. Because in the balloon  like in life  we go very well in unforeseen directions. We want to go in a direction  but the winds push us in another direction  like in life. And as long as we fight horizontally  against life  against the winds  against what's happening to us  life is a nightmare. How do we steer a balloon  By understanding that the atmosphere is made out of several different layers of wind which all have different direction. So  then  we understand that if we want to change our trajectory  in life  or in the balloon  we have to change altitude. Changing altitude  in life  that means raising to another psychological  philosophical  spiritual level. But how do we do that  In ballooning  or in life  how do we change altitude  How do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day  Well  in a balloon it's easy  we have ballast. And when we drop the ballast overboard we climb. Sand  water  all the equipment we don't need anymore. And I think in life it should be exactly like this. You know  when people speak about pioneering spirit  very often they believe that pioneers are the ones who have new ideas. It's not true. The pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas  because new ideas are so easy to have. We just close our eyes for a minute we all come back with a lot of new ideas. No  the pioneer is the one who allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast. Habits  certainties  convictions  exclamation marks  paradigms  dogmas. And when we are able to do that  what happens  Life is not anymore just one line going in one direction in one dimension. No. Life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible directions in three dimensions. And pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves to explore this vertical axis. Of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon  but in life itself. Explore this vertical axis  that means explore all the different ways to do  all the different ways to behave  all the different ways to think  before we find the one that goes in the direction we wish. This is very practical. This can be in politics. This can be in spirituality. This can be in environment  in finance  in education of children. I deeply believe that life is a much greater adventure if we manage to do politics without the trench between the left and the right wing. Because we will throw away these political dogmas. I deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment if we get rid    if we throw overboard this fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past. And that we can aim for much higher spirituality if we get rid of the religious dogmas. Throwing overboard  as ballast  to change our direction. Well  these basically are things I believed in such a long time. But actually I had to go around the world in a balloon to be invited to talk about it. It's clear that it's not easy to know which ballast to drop and which altitude to take. Sometime we need friends  family members or a psychiatrist. Well  in balloons we need weather men  the one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind  at which altitude  in order to help the balloonist. But sometimes it's very paradoxical. When Brian Jones and I were flying around the world  the weather man asked us  one day  to fly quite low  and very slow. And when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it around the world at that speed. So  we disobeyed. We flew much higher  and double the speed. And I was so proud to have found that jetstream that I called the weather man  and I told him   Hey  guy  don't you think we're good pilots up there  We fly twice the speed you predicted.  And he told me   Don't do that. Go down immediately in order to slow down.  And I started to argue. I said   I'm not going to do that. We don't have enough gas to fly so slow.  And he told me   Yes  but with the low pressure you have on your left if you fly too fast  in a couple of hours you will turn left and end up at the North Pole. And then he asked me    and this is something I will never forget in my life    he just asked me   You're the good pilot up there. What do you really want  You want to go very fast in the wrong direction  or slowly in the good direction  And this is why you need weathermen. This is why you need people with long term vision. And this is precisely what fails in the political visions we have now  in the political governments. We are burning  as you heard  so much energy  not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life cannot last for long. So  we went down actually. We slowed down. And we went through moments of fears because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon could allow us to travel        kilometers. But we were expected to have doubts  we're expected to have fears. And actually this is where the adventure really started. When we were flying over the Sahara and India it was nice holidays. We could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane. In the middle of the Pacific  when you don't have the good winds  you cannot land  you cannot go back. That's a crisis. That's the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking. That's the moment when you have to motivate your inner potential  your creativity. That's when you throw out all the ballast  all the certainties  in order to adapt to the new situation. And actually  we changed completely our flight plan. We changed completely our strategy. And after    days we landed successfully in Egypt. But if I show you this picture it's not to tell you how happy we were. It's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles. We took off with  .  tons of liquid propane. We landed with    kilos. When I saw that  I made a promise to myself. I made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world  it would be with no fuel  independent from fossil energies  in order to be safe  not to be threatened by the fuel gauge. I had no idea how it was possible. I just thought it's a dream and I want to do it. And when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington  together with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh  with Apollo     with the Wright Brothers' Flyer  with Chuck Yeager's     I had really a thought then. I thought  well  the   th century  that was brilliant. It allowed to do all those things there. But it will not be possible in the future any more. It takes too much energy. It will cost too much. It will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now. So how can we perpetuate this pioneering spirit with something that will be independent from fossil energy  And this is when the project Solar Impulse really started to turn in my head. And I think it's a nice metaphor also for the   st century. Pioneering spirit should continue  but on another level. Not to conquer the planet or space  not anymore  it has been done  but rather to improve the quality of life. How can we go through the ice of certainty in order to make the most incredible a possible thing  What is today completely impossible    get rid of our dependency on fossil energy. If you tell to people  we want to be independent from fossil energy in our world  people will laugh at you  except here  where crazy people are invited to speak. So  the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar powered airplane  using absolutely no fuel  nobody ever could say in the future that it's impossible to do it for cars  for heating systems  for computers  and so on and so on. Well  solar power airplanes are not new. They have flown in the past  but without saving capabilities  without batteries. Which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of it. If we want to show the potential  we have to fly day and night. That means to load the batteries during the flight  in order to spend the night on the batteries  and fly the next day again. It has been made  already  on remote controlled little airplane models  without pilots. But it stays an anecdote because the public couldn't identify to it. I think you need a pilot in the plane that can talk to the universities  that can talk to students  talk to politicians during the flight  and really make it a human adventure. For that  unfortunately  four meters wingspan is not enough. You need    meter wingspan.    meter wingspan to carry one pilot  the batteries  flies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency. Why that  Because fuel is not easy to replace. That's for sure. And with     square meters of solar power on our plane  we can produce the same energy than     little lightbulbs. That means a Christmas tree  a big Christmas tree. So the question is  how can you carry a pilot around the world with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big Christmas tree  People will tell you it's impossible  and that's exactly why we try to do it. We launched the project with my colleague Andre Borschberg six years ago. We have now    people in the team working on it. We have gone through the stages of simulation  design  computing  preparing the construction of the first prototype. That has been achieved after two years of work. Cockpit  propeller  engine. Just the fuselage here  it's so light. It's not designed by an artist  but it could be.    kilos for the entire fuselage. Couple of kilos more for the wing spars. This is the complete structure of the airplane. And one month ago we have unveiled it. You cannot imagine how it is for a team who has been working six years on it to show that it's not only a dream and a vision  it's a real airplane. A real airplane that we could finally present. And what's the goal now  The goal is to take off  end of this year for the first test  but mainly next year  spring or summer  take off  on our own power  without additional help  without being towed  climb to       meters altitude. The same time we load the batteries  we run the engines  and when we get at the maximum height  we arrive at the beginning of the night. And there  there will be just one goal  just one  reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty. And this is exactly the symbol of our world. If our airplane is too heavy  if the pilot wastes energy  we'll never make it through the night. And in our world  if we keep on spoiling  wasting our energy resources  if we keep on building things that consume so much energy that most of the companies now go bankrupt  it's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation without a major problem. So  you see that this airplane is more a symbol. I don't think it will transport     people in the next years. But when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic  the payload was also just sufficient for one person and some fuel. And    years later there were     people in every airplane crossing the Atlantic. So  we have to start  and show the example. A little bit like on this picture here. This is a painting from Magritte  in the museum in Holland that I love so much. It's a pipe  and it's written   This is not a pipe.  This is not an airplane. This is a symbol of what we can achieve when we believe in the impossible  when we have a team  when we have pioneering spirit  and especially when we understand that all the certainties we have should be thrown overboard. What pleases me very much is that in the beginning I thought that we would have to fly around the world with no fuel in order to have our message been understood. And more and more  we're invited around the world with Andre to talk about that project  to talk about the symbol of it  invited by politicians  invited in energy forums  in order to show that it's not anymore completely stupid to think about getting rid of the dependency on fossil energies. So  through speeches like this one today  through interviews  through meetings  our goal is to get as many people possible on the team. The success will not come if we  just   quote  unquote  fly around the world in a solar powered airplane. No  the success will come if enough people are motivated to do exactly the same in their daily life  save energy  go to renewables. And this is possible. You know  with the technologies we have today  we can save between    and    percent of the energy of a country in Europe  and we can solve half of the rest with renewables. It leaves    or    percent for oil  gas  coal  nuclear  or whatever. This is acceptable. This is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team. You can just go on SolarImpulse.com  subscribe to just be informed of what we're doing. But much more  to get advices  to give your comments  to spread the word that if it's possible in the air  of course it's possible in the ground. And each time we have some ice in the future  we have to know that life will be great  and the success will be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice  to go through the obstacle  to go through the problem  in order to see what there is on the other side. So  you see  this is what we're doing on our side. Everyone has his goal  has his dreams  has his visions. The question I leave you with now is which is the ballast you would like to throw overboard  Which will be the altitude at which you would like to fly in your life  to get to the success that you wish to have  to get to the point that really belongs to you  with the potential you have  and the one you can really fulfill  Because the most renewable energy we have is our own potential  and our own passion. So  let's go for it  and I wish you an excellent adventure in the wings of the future. Thank you. I'd like to talk to you today about the human brain  which is what we do research on at the University of California. Just think about this problem for a second. Here is a lump of flesh  about three pounds  which you can hold in the palm of your hand. But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space. It can contemplate the meaning of infinity  ask questions about the meaning of its own existence  about the nature of God. And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world. It's the greatest mystery confronting human beings  How does this all come about  Well  the brain  as you know  is made up of neurons. We're looking at neurons here. There are     billion neurons in the adult human brain. And each neuron makes something like       to        contacts with other neurons in the brain. And based on this  people have calculated that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe. So  how do you go about studying the brain  One approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain  and study changes in their behavior. This is what I spoke about in the last TED. Today I'll talk about a different approach  which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain  and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain. Sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain. Now  one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in Italy  in Parma  by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues  is a group of neurons called mirror neurons  which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes. Now  it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain  which have been known for over    years. These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action. For example  if I do that  and reach and grab an apple  a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire. If I reach out and pull an object  another neuron will fire  commanding me to pull that object. These are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time. But what Rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons  maybe about    percent of them  will also fire when I'm looking at somebody else performing the same action. So  here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something  but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something. And this is truly astonishing. Because it's as though this neuron is adopting the other person's point of view. It's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person's action. Now  what is the significance of these mirror neurons  For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation. Because to imitate a complex act requires my brain to adopt the other person's point of view. So  this is important for imitation and emulation. Well  why is that important  Well  let's take a look at the next slide. So  how do you do imitation  Why is imitation important  Mirror neurons and imitation  emulation. Now  let's look at culture  the phenomenon of human culture. If you go back in time about          to         years ago  let's look at human evolution  it turns out that something very important happened around        years ago. And that is  there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use  the use of fire  the use of shelters  and  of course  language  and the ability to read somebody else's mind and interpret that person's behavior. All of that happened relatively quickly. Even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago          years ago all of this happened very  very quickly. And I claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system  which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions. So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group  say the use of fire  or a particular type of tool  instead of dying out  this spread rapidly  horizontally across the population  or was transmitted vertically  down the generations. So  this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian  instead of Darwinian. Darwinian evolution is slow  it takes hundreds of thousands of years. A polar bear  to evolve a coat  will take thousands of generations  maybe         years. A human being  a child  can just watch its parent kill another polar bear  and skin it and put the skin on its body  fur on the body  and learn it in one step. What the polar bear took         years to learn  it can learn in five minutes  maybe    minutes. And then once it's learned this it spreads in geometric proportion across a population. This is the basis. The imitation of complex skills is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization. Now there is another kind of mirror neuron  which is involved in something quite different. And that is  there are mirror neurons  just as there are mirror neurons for action  there are mirror neurons for touch. In other words  if somebody touches me  my hand  neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires. But the same neuron  in some cases  will fire when I simply watch another person being touched. So  it's empathizing the other person being touched. So  most of them will fire when I'm touched in different locations. Different neurons for different locations. But a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being touched in the same location. So  here again you have neurons which are enrolled in empathy. Now  the question then arises  If I simply watch another person being touched  why do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation merely by watching somebody being touched  I mean  I empathize with that person but I don't literally feel the touch. Well  that's because you've got receptors in your skin  touch and pain receptors  going back into your brain and saying  Don't worry  you're not being touched. So  empathize  by all means  with the other person  but do not actually experience the touch  otherwise you'll get confused and muddled.  Okay  so there is a feedback signal that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch. But if you remove the arm  you simply anesthetize my arm  so you put an injection into my arm  anesthetize the brachial plexus  so the arm is numb  and there is no sensations coming in  if I now watch you being touched  I literally feel it in my hand. In other words  you have dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings. So  I call them Gandhi neurons  or empathy neurons. And this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense. All that's separating you from him  from the other person  is your skin. Remove the skin  you experience that person's touch in your mind. You've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings. And this  of course  is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy  and that is there is no real independent self  aloof from other human beings  inspecting the world  inspecting other people. You are  in fact  connected not just via Facebook and Internet  you're actually quite literally connected by your neurons. And there is whole chains of neurons around this room  talking to each other. And there is no real distinctiveness of your consciousness from somebody else's consciousness. And this is not mumbo jumbo philosophy. It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience. So  you have a patient with a phantom limb. If the arm has been removed and you have a phantom  and you watch somebody else being touched  you feel it in your phantom. Now the astonishing thing is  if you have pain in your phantom limb  you squeeze the other person's hand  massage the other person's hand  that relieves the pain in your phantom hand  almost as though the neuron were obtaining relief from merely watching somebody else being massaged. So  here you have my last slide. For the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct. C.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures  science on the one hand  humanities on the other  never the twain shall meet. So  I'm saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface allowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness  representation of self  what separates you from other human beings  what allows you to empathize with other human beings  and also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization  which is unique to human beings. Thank you. So      years ago  Dr. R ntgen X rayed his wife's hand. Quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor with her brooch  I'm not sure. It seems a bit extreme to me. That image was the start of the X ray technology. And I'm still fundamentally using the same principles today. I'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner. The first shot I ever did was of a soda can  which was to promote a brand that we all know  so I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it. But the second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day. And I do really like this shot  because it shows all the detritus that's sort of embedded in the sole of the sneakers. It was just one of those pot luck things where you get it right first time. Moving on to something a bit larger  this is an X ray of a bus. And the bus is full of people. It's actually the same person. It's just one skeleton. And back in the '  s  they used to teach student radiographers to take X rays  thankfully not on you and I  but on dead people. So  I've still got access to one of these dead people called Frieda  she's falling apart  I'm afraid  because she's very old and fragile. But everyone on that bus is Frieda. And the bus is taken with a cargo scanning X ray  which is the sort of machine you have on borders  which checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things. Fairly obvious what that is. So  using large scale objects does sort of create drama because you just don't see X rays of big things that often. Technology is moving ahead  and these large cargo scanner X rays that work with the digital system are getting better and better and better. Again though  to make it come alive you need  somehow  to add the human element. And I think the reason this image works  again  is because Frieda is driving the bulldozer. Quite a difficult brief  make a pair of men's pants look beautiful. But I think the process  in itself  shows how exquisite they are. Fashion    now  I'm sort of anti fashion because I don't show the surface  I show what's within. So  the fashionistas don't really like me because it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it  it looks the same. We all look the same inside  believe me. The creases in the material and the sort of nuances. And I show things for really what they are  what they're made of. I peel back the layers and expose it. And if it's well made I show it  if it's badly made I show it. And I'm sure Ross can associate that with design. The design comes from within. It's not just Topshop  I get some strange looks when I go out getting my props. Here I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department of a department store  almost got escorted from the premises. I live opposite a farm. And this was the runt of the litter  a piglet that died. And what's really interesting is  if you look at the legs  you'll notice that the bones haven't fused. And should that pig have grown  unfortunately it was dead  it would have certainly been dead after I X rayed it  with the amount of radiation I used anyway. But once the bones had fused together it would have been healthy. So  that's an empty parka jacket. But I quite love the way it's posed. Nature is my greatest inspiration. And to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with is how nature is related to architecture. If you look at the roof of the Eden Project  or the British library  it's all this honeycomb structure. And I'm sure those architects are inspired  as I am  by what surrounds us  by nature. This  in fact  is a Victoria water lily leaf that floats on the top of a pond. An amaryllis flower looking really three dimensional. Seaweed  ebbing in the tide. Now  how do I do this  and where do I do this  and all of that sort of thing. This is my new  purpose built  X ray shed. And the door to my X ray room is made of lead and steel. It weighs       kilograms and the only exercise I get is opening and closing it. The walls are     millimeters thick of solid dense concrete. So  I'm using quite a lot of radiation. A lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's. And there I am. This is a quite high powered X ray machine. What's interesting really about X ray really is  if you think about it  is that that technology is used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs  or looking for contraband or whatever. And I use that sort of technology to create things that are quite beautiful. So  still working with film  I'm afraid. Technology in X ray where it's life size processed  apart from these large cargo scanning machines  hasn't moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resolution to be good enough for what I want to do with it  which is show my pictures big. So  I have to use a     s drum scanner  which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film. They scan each individual X ray. And this shows how I do my process of same size X rays. So  this is  again  my daughter's dress. Still has the tag in it from me buying it  so I can take it back to the shop if she didn't like it. But there are four X ray plates. You can see them overlapping. So  when you move forward from something fairly small  a dress which is this size  onto something like that which is done in exactly the same process  you can see that that is a lot of work. In fact  that is three months solid X raying. There is over     separate components. Boeing sent me a     in containers. And I sent them back an X ray. Okay  so Frieda is my dead skeleton. This  unfortunately  is basically two pictures. One on the extreme right is a photograph of an American footballer. The one on the left is an x ray. But this time I had to use a real body. Because I needed all the skin tissue to make it look real  to make it look like it was a real athlete. So  here I had to use a recently deceased body. And getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious. But people do donate their bodies to art and science. And when they do  I'm in the queue. So  I like to use them. The coloring  so coloring adds another level to the X rays. It makes it more organic  more natural. It's whatever takes my fancy  really. It's not accurately colored to how it is in real life. That flower doesn't come in bright orange  I don't think. But I just like it in bright orange. And also with something technical  like these are DJ decks  it sort of adds another level. It makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional. The most difficult things to X ray  the most technically challenging things to X ray are the lightest things  the most delicate things. To get the detail in a feather  believe me  if there is anyone out here who knows anything about X rays  that's quite a challenge. I'm now going to show you a short film  I'll step to the side. Video   Music  The thing in there is very dangerous. If you touch that  you could possibly die through radiation poisoning. In my career I've had two exposures to radiation  which is two too many  because it stays with you for life. It's cumulative. It has human connotations. The fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize  but also it looks like it's a robot  and it comes from a sci fi genus. It's a surprise that it has humanity  but also man made  future  alien associations. And it's just a bit spooky. The bus was done with a cargo scanning X ray machine  which is used on the borders between countries  looking for contraband and illegal immigrants. The lorry goes in front of it. And it takes slices of X rays through the lorry. And that's how this was done. It's actually slice  slice. It's a bit like a CT scanner in a hospital. Slices. And then if you look carefully  there is all little things. He's got headphones on  reading the newspaper  got a hat on  glasses  got a bag. So  these little details help to make it work  make it real. The problem with using living people is that to take an X ray  if I X ray you  you get exposed to radiation. So  to avoid that    I have to avoid it somehow    is I use dead people. Now  that's a variety of things  from recently deceased bodies  to a skeleton that was used by student radiographers to train in taking X rays of the human body  at different densities. I have very high tech equipment of gloves  scissors and a bucket. I will show how the capillary action works  how it feeds  I'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem. Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves. Look at this monster. It's so basic. It just grows wild. That's what I really like about it  the fact that I haven't got to go and buy it  and it hasn't been genetically modified at all. It's just happening. And the X ray shows how beautiful nature can be. Not that that is particularly beautiful when you look at it with the human eye  the way the leaves form. They're curling back on each other. So the X ray will show the overlaps in these little corners. The thicker the object  the more radiation it needs  and the more time it needs. The lighter the object  the less radiation. Sometimes you keep the time up  because the time gives you detail. The longer the exposure goes on for  the more detail you get. If you look at this  just the tube  it is quite bright. But I could get a bit darker in the tube  but everything else would suffer. So  these leaves at the edge would start to disappear. What I like is how hard the edges are  how sharp. Yeah  I'm quite pleased with it. I travel beyond the surface and show something for what it's worth  for what it's really made of  how it really works. But also I find that I've got the benefit of taking away all the surface  which is things that people are used to seeing. And that's the sort of thing I've been doing. I've got the opportunity now to show you what I'm going to be doing in the future. This is a commercial application of my most recent work. And what's good about this  I think  is that it's like a moment in time  like you've turned around  you've got X ray vision and you've taken a picture with the X ray camera. Unfortunately I haven't got X ray vision. I do dream in X ray. I see my projects in my sleep. And I know what they're going to look like in X ray and I'm not far off. So  what am I doing in the future  Well  this year is the   th anniversary of Issigonis's Mini  which is one of my favorite cars. So  I've taken it apart  component by component  months and months and months of work. And with this image  I'm going to be displaying it in the Victoria and Albert Museum as a light box  which is actually attached to the car. So  I've got to saw the car in half  down the middle  not an easy task  in itself. And then  so you can get in the driver's side  sit down  and up against you is a wall. And if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car  you see a life sized light box of the car showing you how it works. And I'm going to take that idea and apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life. Like  my first computer was a big movement in my life. And I had a Mac Classic. And it's a little box. And I think that would look quite neat as an X ray. I'm also looking to take my work from the two dimensional form to a more three dimensional form. And this is quite a good way of doing it. I'm also working now with X ray video. So  if you can imagine  some of these flowers  and they're actually moving and growing and you can film that in X ray  should be quite stunning. But that's it. I'm done. Thank you very much. Something called the Danish Twin Study established that only about    percent of how long the average person lives  within certain biological limits  is dictated by our genes. The other    percent is dictated by our lifestyle. So the premise of Blue Zones  if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity. But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula of longevity is  they probably couldn't tell you. They've probably heard of the South Beach Diet  or the Atkins Diet. You have the USDA food pyramid. There is what Oprah tells us. There is what Doctor Oz tells us. The fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion around what really helps us live longer better. Should you be running marathons or doing yoga  Should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu  When it comes to supplements  should you be taking them  How about these hormones or resveratrol  And does purpose play into it  Spirituality  And how about how we socialize  Well  our approach to finding longevity was to team up with National Geographic  and the National Institute on Aging  to find the four demographically confirmed areas that are geographically defined. And then bring a team of experts in there to methodically go through exactly what these people do  to distill down the cross cultural distillation. And at the end of this I'm going to tell you what that distillation is. But first I'd like to debunk some common myths when it comes to longevity. And the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be    . False. The problem is  only about one out of       people in America live to be    . Your chances are very low. Even though it's the fastest growing demographic in America  it's hard to reach    . The problem is that we're not programmed for longevity. We are programmed for something called procreative success. I love that word. It reminds me of my college days. Biologists term procreative success to mean the age where you have children and then another generation  the age when your children have children. After that the effect of evolution completely dissipates. If you're a mammal  if you're a rat or an elephant  or a human  in between  it's the same story. So to make it to age      you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle  you also have to have won the genetic lottery. The second myth is  there are treatments that can help slow  reverse  or even stop aging. False. When you think of it  there is    things that can age us. Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes  those brain cells die  they never come back. Play tennis too hard  on your knees  ruin your cartilage  the cartilage never comes back. Our arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque  and we can get Alzheimer's. There is just too many things to go wrong. Our bodies have    trillion cells  trillion with a  T.  We're talking national debt numbers here. Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years. And every time they turn themselves over there is some damage. And that damage builds up. And it builds up exponentially. It's a little bit like the days when we all had Beatles albums or Eagles albums and we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape  and let our friends copy that cassette tape  and pretty soon  with successive generations that tape sounds like garbage. Well  the same things happen to our cells. That's why a    year old person is aging at a rate of about     times faster than a    year old person. So  if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging  what am I doing here  Well  the fact of the matter is the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body  my body  your body  is about    years  a little bit more for women. But life expectancy in this country is only   . So somewhere along the line  we're leaving about    good years on the table. These are years that we could get. And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease  heart disease  cancer and diabetes. We think the best way to get these missing years is to look at the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them  areas where people are living to age     at rates up to    times greater than we are  areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years  the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction of what it is in this country. We found our first Blue Zone about     miles off the coast of Italy  on the island of Sardinia. And not the entire island  the island is about  .  million people  but only up in the highlands  an area called the Nuoro province. And here we have this area where men live the longest  about    times more centenarians than we have here in America. And this is a place where people not only reach age      they do so with extraordinary vigor. Places where     year olds still ride their bike to work  chop wood  and can beat a guy    years younger than them. Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ. It's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated. Because the land is so infertile  they largely are shepherds  which occasions regular  low intensity physical activity. Their diet is mostly plant based  accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields. They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat  a type of cheese made from grass fed animals so the cheese is high in Omega   fatty acids instead of Omega   fatty acids from corn fed animals  and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world. It's called Cannonau. But the real secret I think lies more in the way that they organize their society. And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society is how they treat older people. You ever notice here in America  social equity seems to peak at about age     Just look at the advertisements. Here in Sardinia  the older you get the more equity you have  the more wisdom you're celebrated for. You go into the bars in Sardinia  instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar  you see the centenarian of the month calendar. This  as it turns out  is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family    it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy    research shows it's also good for the children of those families  who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease. That's called the grandmother effect. We found our second Blue Zone on the other side of the planet  about     miles south of Tokyo  on the archipelago of Okinawa. Okinawa is actually     small islands. And in the northern part of the main island  this is ground zero for world longevity. This is a place where the oldest living female population is found. It's a place where people have the longest disability free life expectancy in the world. They have what we want. They live a long time  and tend to die in their sleep  very quickly  and often  I can tell you  after sex. They live about seven good years longer than the average American. Five times as many centenarians as we have in America. One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer  big killers here in America. And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease. And the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers suggests strongly they have something to teach us. What do they do  Once again  a plant based diet  full of vegetables with lots of color in them. And they eat about eight times as much tofu as Americans do. More significant than what they eat is how they eat it. They have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating  which  as you know  is a big problem here in America. A few of the strategies we observed  they eat off of smaller plates  so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting. Instead of serving family style  where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking  they serve at the counter  put the food away  and then bring it to the table. They also have a       year old adage  which I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented. It was invented by Confucius. And that diet is known as the Hara  Hatchi  Bu diet. It's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is      percent full. It takes about a half hour for that full feeling to travel from your belly to your brain. And by remembering to stop at    percent it helps keep you from doing that very thing. But  like Sardinia  Okinawa has a few social constructs that we can associate with longevity. We know that isolation kills. Fifteen years ago  the average American had three good friends. We're down to one and half right now. If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa  you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through life. They call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck  and if things go bad  child gets sick  parent dies  you always have somebody who has your back. This particular Moai  these five ladies have been together for    years. Their average age is    . Typically in America we've divided our adult life up into two sections. There is our work life  where we're productive. And then one day  boom  we retire. And typically that has meant retiring to the easy chair  or going down to Arizona to play golf. In the Okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement. Instead there is one word that imbues your entire life  and that word is  ikigai.  And  roughly translated  it means  the reason for which you wake up in the morning.  For this     year old karate master  his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art. For this hundred year old fisherman it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week. And this is a question. The National Institute on Aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians. And one of the questions  they were very culturally astute  the people who put the questionnaire. One of the questions was   What is your ikigai   They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning. For this     year old woman  her ikigai was simply her great great great granddaughter. Two girls separated in age by     and a half years. And I asked her what it felt like to hold a great great great granddaughter. And she put her head back and she said   It feels like leaping into heaven.  I thought that was a wonderful thought. My editor at Geographic wanted me to find America's Blue Zone. And for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota  where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians. But that's because all the young people left. So  we turned to the data again. And we found America's longest lived population among the Seventh Day Adventists concentrated in and around Loma Linda  California. Adventists are conservative Methodists. They celebrate their Sabbath from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday. A     hour sanctuary in time   they call it. And they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity  comparatively speaking. In America here  life expectancy for the average woman is   . But for an Adventist woman  their life expectancy is   . And the difference is even more pronounced among men  who are expected to live about    years longer than their American counterparts. Now  this is a study that followed about        people for    years. Sterling study. And I think it supremely illustrates the premise of this Blue Zone project. This is a heterogeneous community. It's white  black  Hispanic  Asian. The only thing that they have in common are a set of very small lifestyle habits that they follow ritualistically for most of their lives. They take their diet directly from the Bible. Genesis  Chapter one  Verse       where God talks about legumes and seeds  and on one more stanza about green plants  ostensibly missing is meat. They take this sanctuary in time very serious. For    hours every week  no matter how busy they are  how stressed out they are at work  where the kids need to be driven  they stop everything and they focus on their God  their social network  and then  hardwired right in the religion  are nature walks. And the power of this is not that it's done occasionally  the power is it's done every week for a lifetime. None of it's hard. None of it costs money. Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists. So  if you go to an Adventist's party you don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint. Instead they're talking about their next nature walk  exchanging recipes  and yes  they pray. But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways. This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham. Ellsworth Whareham is    years old. He's a multimillionaire  yet when a contractor wanted       dollars to build a privacy fence  he said   For that kind of money I'll do it myself.  So for the next three days he was out shoveling cement  and hauling poles around. And predictably  perhaps  on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room. But not as the guy on the table  the guy doing open heart surgery. At    he still does    open heart surgeries every month. Ed Rawlings      years old now  an active cowboy  starts his morning with a swim. And on weekends he likes to put on the boards  throw up rooster tails. And then Marge Deton. Marge is    . Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here. She starts her day with lifting weights. She rides her bicycle. And then she gets in her root beer colored      Cadillac Seville  and tears down the San Bernardino freeway  where she still volunteers for seven different organizations. I've been on    hardcore expeditions. I'm probably the only person you'll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the Sahara desert without sunscreen. But I'll tell you  there is no adventure more harrowing than riding shotgun with Marge Deton.  A stranger is a friend I haven't met yet   she'd say to me. So  what are the common denominators in these three cultures  What are the things that they all do  And we managed to boil it down to nine. In fact we've done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this and these common denominators hold true. And the first one  and I'm about to utter a heresy here  none of them exercise  at least the way we think of exercise. Instead  they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity. These     year old Okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground  they sit on the floor     or    times a day. Sardinians live in vertical houses  up and down the stairs. Every trip to the store  or to church or to a friend's house occasions a walk. They don't have any conveniences. There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work. If they want to mix up a cake  they're doing it by hand. That's physical activity. That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does. When they do do intentional physical activity  it's the things they enjoy. They tend to walk  the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline  and they all tend to have a garden. They know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook. Each of these cultures take time to downshift. The Sardinians pray. The Seventh Day Adventists pray. The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration. But when you're in a hurry or stressed out  that triggers something called the inflammatory response  which is associated with everything from Alzheimer's disease to cardiovascular disease. When you slow down for    minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more anti inflammatory state. They have vocabulary for sense of purpose  ikigai  like the Okinawans. You know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you're born  because of infant mortality  and the year you retire. These people know their sense of purpose  and they activate in their life  that's worth about seven years of extra life expectancy. There's no longevity diet. Instead  these people drink a little bit every day  not a hard sell to the American population. They tend to eat a plant based diet. Doesn't mean they don't eat meat  but lots of beans and nuts. And they have strategies to keep from overeating  little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time. And then the foundation of all this is how they connect. They put their families first  take care of their children and their aging parents. They all tend to belong to a faith based community  which is worth between four and    extra years of life expectancy if you do it four times a month. And the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe. They were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people. We know from the Framingham studies  that if your three best friends are obese there is a    percent better chance that you'll be overweight. So  if you hang out with unhealthy people  that's going to have a measurable impact over time. Instead  if your friend's idea of recreation is physical activity  bowling  or playing hockey  biking or gardening  if your friends drink a little  but not too much  and they eat right  and they're engaged  and they're trusting and trustworthy  that is going to have the biggest impact over time. Diets don't work. No diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population. Exercise programs usually start in January  they're usually done by October. When it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else. But when you think about it  your friends are long term adventures  and therefore  perhaps the most significant thing you can do to add more years to your life  and life to your years. Thank you very much. I want you to put off your preconceptions  your preconceived fears and thoughts about reptiles. Because that is the only way I'm going to get my story across to you. And by the way  if I come across as a sort of rabid  hippie conservationist  it's purely a figment of your imagination. Okay. We are actually the first species on Earth to be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival. And I know we've all seen images enough to make us numb  of the tragedies that we're perpetrating on the planet. We're kind of like greedy kids  using it all up  aren't we  And today is a time for me to talk to you about water. It's not only because we like to drink lots of it  and its marvelous derivatives  beer  wine  etc. And  of course  watch it fall from the sky and flow in our wonderful rivers  but for several other reasons as well. When I was a kid  growing up in New York  I was smitten by snakes  the same way most kids are smitten by tops  marbles  cars  trains  cricket balls. And my mother  brave lady  was partly to blame  taking me to the New York Natural History Museum  buying me books on snakes  and then starting this infamous career of mine  which has culminated in of course  arriving in India    years ago  brought by my mother  Doris Norden  and my stepfather  Rama Chattopadhyaya. It's been a roller coaster ride. Two animals  two iconic reptiles really captivated me very early on. One of them was the remarkable gharial. This crocodile  which grows to almost    feet long in the northern rivers  and this charismatic snake  the king cobra. What my purpose of the talk today really is  is to sort of indelibly scar your minds with these charismatic and majestic creatures. Because this is what you will take away from here  a reconnection with nature  I hope. The king cobra is quite remarkable for several reasons. What you're seeing here is very recently shot images in a forest nearby here  of a female king cobra making her nest. Here is a limbless animal  capable of gathering a huge mound of leaves  and then laying her eggs inside  to withstand   to     meters of rainfall   in order that the eggs can incubate over the next    days  and hatch into little baby king cobras. So  she protects her eggs  and after three months  the babies finally do hatch out. A majority of them will die  of course. There is very high mortality in little baby reptiles who are just    to    inches long. My first experience with king cobras was in '   at a magical place called Agumbe  in Karnataka  this state. And it is a marvelous rain forest. This first encounter was kind of like the Maasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior. It really changed my life totally. And it brought me straight into the conservation fray. I ended up starting this research and education station in Agumbe  which you are all of course invited to visit. This is basically a base wherein we are trying to gather and learn virtually everything about the biodiversity of this incredibly complex forest system  and try to hang on to what's there  make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean  and of course  having a good time too. You can almost hear the drums throbbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we're there. It was very important for us to get through to the people. And through the children is usually the way to go. They are fascinated with snakes. They haven't got that steely thing that you end up either fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way. They are interested. And it really works to start with them. This gives you an idea of the size of some of these snakes. This is an average size king cobra  about    feet long. And it actually crawled into somebody's bathroom  and was hanging around there for two or three days. The people of this part of India worship the king cobra. And they didn't kill it. They called us to catch it. Now we've caught more than     king cobras over the last three years  and relocated them in nearby forests. But in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures  it was necessary  for us to actually insert a small radio transmitter inside  each  snake. Now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets  where the babies go after they hatch  and remarkable things like this you're about to see. This was just a few days ago in Agumbe. I had the pleasure of being close to this large king cobra who had caught a venomous pit viper. And it does it in such a way that it doesn't get bitten itself. And king cobras feed only on snakes. This  little snake  was kind of a tid bit for it  what we'd call a  vadai  or a donut or something like that. Usually they eat something a bit larger. In this case a rather strange and inexplicable activity happened over the last breeding season  wherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra  didn't mate with it  actually killed it and swallowed it. We're still trying to explain and come to terms with what is the evolutionary advantage of this. But they do also a lot of other remarkable things. This is again  something  we were able to see  by virtue of the fact that we had a radio transmitter in one of the snakes. This male snake     feet long  met another male king cobra. And they did this incredible ritual combat dance. It's very much like the rutting of mammals  including humans  you know  sorting out our differences  but gentler  no biting allowed. It's just a wresting match  but a remarkable activity. Now  what are we doing with all this information  What's the point of all this  Well  the king cobra is literally a keystone species in these rainforests. And our job is to convince the authorities that these forests have to be protected. And this is one of the ways we do it  by learning as much as we can about something so remarkable and so iconic in the rainforests there  in order to help protect trees  animals and of course the water sources. You've all heard  perhaps  of Project Tiger which started back in the early '  s  which was  in fact  a very dynamic time for conservation. We were piloted  I could say  by a highly autocratic stateswoman  but who also had an incredible passion for environment. And this is the time when Project Tiger emerged. And  just like Project Tiger  our activities with the king cobra is to look at a species of animal so that we protect its habitat and everything within it. So  the tiger is the icon. And now the king cobra is a new one. All the major rivers in south India are sourced in the Western Ghats  the chain of hills running along the west coast of India. It pours out millions of gallons every hour  and supplies drinking water to at least     million people  and washes many  many babies  and of course feeds many  many animals  both domestic and wild  produces thousands of tons of rice. And what do we do  How do we respond to this  Well  basically  we dam it  we pollute it  we pour in pesticides  weedicides  fungicides. You drink it in peril of your life. And the thing is  it's not just big industry. It's not misguided river engineers who are doing all this  it's us. It seems that our citizens find the best way to dispose of garbage are in water sources. Okay. Now we're going north  very far north. North central India  the Chambal River is where we have our base. This is the home of the gharial  this incredible crocodile. It is an animal which has been on the Earth for just about     million years. It survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off. It has remarkable features. Even though it grows to    feet long  since it eats only fish it's not dangerous to human beings. It does have big teeth  however  and it's kind of hard to convince people if an animal has big teeth  that it's a harmless creature. But we  actually  back in the early '  s  did surveys  and found that gharial were extremely rare. In fact  if you see the map  the range of their original habitat was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan to the Irrawaddy in Burma. And now it's just limited to a couple of spots in Nepal and India. So  in fact at this point there are only     breeding gharial left in the wild. So  starting in the mid '  s when conservation was at the fore  we were actually able to start projects which were basically government supported to collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests and release       baby gharial back to the wild. And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this. I mean  just incredible to see bunches of gharial basking on the river again. But complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt. And  sure enough  with all the other pressures on the river  like sand mining  for example  very  very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river's edge  not allowing the animals to breed anymore  we're looking at even more problems building up for the gharial  despite the early good intentions. Their nests hatching along the riverside producing hundreds of hatchlings. It's just an amazing sight. This was actually just taken last year. But then the monsoon arrives  and unfortunately downriver there is always a dam or there is always a barrage  and  shoop  they get washed down to their doom. Luckily there is still a lot of interest. My pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN  the  Madras Crocodile Bank   an NGO  the World Wildlife Fund  the Wildlife Institute of India  State Forest Departments  and the Ministry of Environment  we all work together on stuff. But it's possibly  and definitely not enough. For example  in the winter of      and       there was this incredible die off of gharial  in the Chambal River. Suddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river  dead. Why  How could it happen  This is a relatively clean river. The Chambal  if you look at it  has clear water. People scoop water out of the Chambal and drink it  something you wouldn't do in most north Indian rivers. So  in order to try to find out the answer to this  we got veterinarians from all over the world working with Indian vets to try to figure out what was happening. I was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside. And we actually looked through all their organs and tried to figure out what was going on. And it came down to something called gout  which  as a result of kidney breakdown is actually uric acid crystals throughout the body  and worse in the joints  which made the gharial unable to swim. And it's a horribly painful death. Just downriver from the Chambal is the filthy Yamuna river  the sacred Yamuna river. And I hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it but it's the truth. It's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine. It flows down through Delhi  Mathura  Agra  and gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine. So  it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain  something in the fish they were eating. And  you know  once a toxin is in the food chain everything is affected  including us. Because these rivers are the lifeblood of people all along their course. In order to try to answer some of these questions  we again turn to technology  to biological technology  in this case  again  telemetry  putting radios on    gharial  and actually following their movements. They're being watched everyday as we speak  to try to find out what this mysterious toxin is. The Chambal river is an absolutely incredible place. It's a place that's famous to a lot of you who know about the bandits  the dacoits who used to work up there. And there still are quite a few around. But Poolan Devi was one  of them . Which actually Shekhar Kapur made an incredible movie   The Bandit Queen   which I urge you to see. You'll get to see the incredible  Chambal  landscape as well. But  again  heavy fishing pressures. This is one of the last repositories of the Ganges river dolphin  various species of turtles  thousands of migratory birds  and fishing is causing problems like this. And now  these  new elements of human intolerance for river creatures like the gharial means that if they don't drown in the net  then they simply cut their beaks off. Animals like the Ganges river dolphin which is just down to a few left  and it is also critically endangered. So  who is next  Us  Because we are all dependent on these water sources. So  we all know about the Narmada river  the tragedies of dams  the tragedies of huge projects which displace people and wreck river systems without providing livelihoods. And development just basically going berserk  for a double figure growth index  basically. So  we're not sure where this story is going to end  whether it's got a happy or sad ending. And climate change is certainly going to turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads. We're still working hard at it. We've got a lot of a good team of people working up there. And the thing is  you know  the decision makers  the folks in power  they're up in their bungalows and so on in Delhi  in the city capitals. They are all supplied with plenty of water. It's cool. But out on the rivers there are still millions of people who are in really bad shape. And it's a bleak future for them. So  we have our Ganges and Yamuna cleanup project. We've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it  and nothing to show for it. Incredible. So  people talk about political will. During the die off of the gharial we did galvanize a lot of action. Government cut through all the red tape  we got foreign vets on it. It was great. So  we can do it. But if you stroll down to the Yamuna or to the Gomati in Lucknow  or to the Adyar river in Chennai  or the Mula Mutha river in Pune  just see what we're capable of doing to a river. It's sad. But I think the final note really is that we can do it. The corporates  the artists  the wildlife nuts  the good old everyday folks can actually bring these rivers back. And the final word is that there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders. And there is a gharial looking at us from the river. And these are powerful water totems. And they are going to disturb our dreams until we do the right thing. Namaste. Chris Anderson  Thanks  Rom. Thanks a lot. You know  most people are terrified of snakes. And there might be quite a few people here who would be very glad to see the last king cobra bite the dust. Do you have those conversations with people  How do you really get them to care  Romulus Whitaker  I take the sort of humble approach  I guess you could say. I don't say that snakes are huggable exactly. It's not like the teddy bear. But I sort of    there is an innocence in these animals. And when the average person looks at a cobra going  Ssssss   like that  they say   My god  look at that angry  dangerous creature.  I look at it as a creature who is totally frightened of something so dangerous as a human being. And that is the truth. And that's what I try to get out. CA  Now  incredible footage you showed of the viper being killed. You were saying that that hasn't been filmed before. RW  Yes  this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it  for one thing. As I said  it's just like a little snack for him  you know  Usually they eat larger snakes like rat snakes  or even cobras. But this guy who we're following right now is in the deep jungle. Whereas other king cobras very often come into the human interface  you know  the plantations  to find big rat snakes and stuff. This guy specializes in pit vipers. And the guy who is working there with them  he's from Maharashtra  he said   I think he's after the nusha.  Now  the nusha means the high. Whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush. CA  Thanks Rom. Thank you. Hi. For those of you who haven't seen dancing bears  these are the dancing bears. In       we started working on a two year investigative research project to try and find out what was going on. Because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted because of this. This is the Qalandar community. They are a marginalized Islamic community who live across India  and have been in India since the   th century. We went about getting evidence of what was going on. And this is footage from a hidden camera in a button. And we went in  pretending to be buyers. And we found this right in this very state  in Karnataka. And the bear cubs were being harvested from across the country and being sold and traded. These were being sold for about       dollars each  and they are used for bear paw soup  and also being trained  later on  to become dancing bears like the one you just saw. Sadly  the family of Qalandars depended on this bear. The couple are barely    years old. They already have four children beside them. You can see them. And the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals. So  we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner. Now  when we started working deeper and digging deeper  we found that it's an illegal act. These guys could go to jail for up to seven years if they were caught by authorities. And what they were doing to the bears was really appalling. It was unacceptable. The mother bears are usually killed. The cubs  which are taken  are separated. Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod. And they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle. Now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that for a livelihood  to getting something else. So  this is Bitu Qalandar  who was our first experiment. And we were so unsure that this would work. We weren't sure at all. And we managed to convince him. And we said   Okay  here is some seed fund. Let's see if you can get something else.  And we got the bear surrendered to    we set up a sanctuary. We have four sanctuaries in India. And now he sells cool drinks  he's by the highway. He has a telephone booth. And then it started  there was no turning back after that. This is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear. And now he runs a cattle fodder store and a grain store near Agra. Then there was no looking back at all for us. We gave cycle rickshaws. We set up carpet weaving units  vocational training for the women. The women were just not allowed to come out of the community and work with mainstream society. So  we were able to address that. Education. The kids never went to school. They only had Islamic education  very little of it. And they were never allowed to go to school because they were an extra earning hand at home. So we managed to get education. So  we sponsor     children education programs today. We were able to ensure brighter futures for these people. Of course we also had to get the bears in. This is what happens to the bears when they come in. And this is what we turn them into. We have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers. So  basically in      there were       dancing bears. We rescued over     dancing bears. We've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears. The big news that I want to announce today is that next month we will be bringing in the very last bear of India  into our rescue center. And India will no longer have to witness this cruel barbaric practice which has been here for centuries. And the people can hold their heads up high. And the Qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past that they've lived all their lives. And the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again. And there will be no more removing of these bears. And the children  both humans and bear cubs can live peacefully. Thank you. Contagious is a good word. Even in the times of H N   I like the word. Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious. Inspiration is contagious. We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers. But for me  what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something I call the  I Can  bug. So  the question is  why only them  In a country of a billion people and some  why so few  Is it luck  Is it chance  Can we all not systematically and consciously get infected  So  in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story. I got infected when I was     when  as a student of the design college  I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas  challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me. And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt  and how contagious that feeling was. I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven. So  when I started Riverside school    years ago it became a lab  a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the  I Can  bug. And I uncovered that if learning is embedded in real world context  that if you blur the boundaries between school and life  then children go through a journey of  aware   where they can see the change   enable   be changed  and then  empower   lead the change. And that directly increased student wellbeing. Children became more competent  and less helpless. But this was all common sense. So  I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at Riverside. A little background  when my grade five was learning about child rights  they were made to roll incense sticks  agarbattis  for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer. It transformed them. What you will see is their journey  and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world. That's them rolling. And in two hours  after their backs were broke  they were changed. And once that happened  they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished. And look at Ragav  that moment when his face changes because he's been able to understand that he has shifted that man's mindset. And that can't happen in a classroom. So  when Ragav experienced that he went from  teacher told me   to  I am doing it.  And that's the  I Can  mindshift. And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured. But we had parents who said   Okay  making our children good human beings is all very well  but what about math and science and English  Show us the grades.  And we did. The data was conclusive. When children are empowered  not only do they do good  they do well  in fact very well  as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over       schools in India  Riverside children were outperforming the top    schools in India in math  English and science. So  it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside. So  on August   th  Independence Day        the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad. Now it was not about Riverside school. It was about all children. So  we were shameless. We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation  the police  the press  businesses  and basically said   When are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child  When will you include the child in the city  Basically  open your hearts and your minds to the child.  So  how did the city respond  Since      every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood. Here was a city telling its child   You can.  A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad. Video   Unclear  So  the busiest streets closed down. We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us. It gets taken over by children. They are skating. They are doing street plays. They are playing  all free  for all children. Atul Karwal  aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier. And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city. Kiran Bir Sethi  And the city will give free time. And Ahmedabad got the first child friendly zebra crossing in the world. Geet Sethi  When a city gives to the children  in the future the children will give back to the city. KBS  And because of that  Ahmedabad is known as India's first child friendly city. So  you're getting the pattern. First     children at Riverside. Then        children in Ahmedabad  and growing. It was time now to infect India. So  on August   th  again  Independence Day        empowered with the same process  we empowered         children to say   I can.  How  We designed a simple toolkit  converted it into eight languages  and reached        schools. We basically gave children a very simple challenge. We said  take one idea  anything that bothers you  choose one week  and change a billion lives. And they did. Stories of change poured in from all over India  from Nagaland in the east  to Jhunjhunu in the west  from Sikkim in the north  to Krishnagiri in the south. Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems. Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism  and    children who stopped    child marriages in Rajasthan. I mean  it was incredible. Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say   You can   then they will. Infection in India. This is in Rajasthan  a rural village. Child  Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write. KBS  First time  a rally and a street play in a rural school    unheard of    to tell their parents why literacy is important. Look at what their parents says. Man  This program is wonderful. We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write. Woman  I am so happy that my students did this campaign. In the future  I will never doubt my students' abilities. See  They have done it. KBS  An inner city school in Hyderabad. Girl     . This house is     ... We have to start collecting from    . KBS  Girls and boys in Hyderabad  going out  pretty difficult  but they did it. Woman  Even though they are so young  they have done such good work. First they have cleaned the society  then it will be Hyderabad  and soon India. Woman  It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me that they had so much inside them. Girl  Thank you  ladies and gentlemen. For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you  for a very good cause  the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids. Are you ready  ladies and gentlemen  Audience  Yes  Girl  Are you ready  Audience  Yes  Girl  Are you ready  Audience  Yes  KBS  So  the charter of compassion starts right here. Street plays  auctions  petitions. I mean  they were changing lives. It was incredible. So  how can we still stay immune  How can we stay immune to that passion  that energy  that excitement  I know it's obvious  but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change  Gandhiji.    years ago  it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of  We can.  So  today who is it going to take to spread the infection from         children to the     million children in India  Last I heard  the preamble still said   We  the people of India   right  So  if not us  then who  If not now  then when  Like I said  contagious is a good word. Thank you. I am going to be talking about secrets. Obviously the best way to divulge a secret is to tell someone to not say anything about it. Secrets. I'm using PowerPoint this year just because  you know  I'm into the TED thing. And when you use these things you don't have to go like that. You just press it. Oh  man. Um  yes. Yes. I'm sure  Just change it  Is Bill Gates here  Change it  Come on  What  Ah  Okay. That's not my slides  but it's okay. As you can see  these are all maps. And maps are important devices for transferring information  especially if you have human cognitive ability. We can see that all formulas are really maps. Now  as humans  we make maps of places that we seldom even go  which seems a little wasteful of time. This  of course  is a map of the moon. There're some very delightful names. Tranquilacalitis   unclear . My favorite is Frigoris. What are these people thinking  Frigoris  What the Frigoris you doing  Names are important. Frigoris  This is the Moon. People could live there one day. I'll meet you at Frigoris. No. I don't think so. There we see Mars  again with various names. And this is all done  by the way  by the International Astronomical Union. This is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects. This is from their actual book. These are some of the names that they have chosen  ladies and gentlemen. I'll go through a little of them. Bolotnitsa. That  of course  is the Slavic swamp mermaid. Now I think the whole concept of a mermaid doesn't really blend into the swamp feel.  Oh look  Mermaid come out of swamp. Oh boy  It's time for Bolotnitsa   Djabran Fluctus. If that don't flow off the tongue  what does  I mean kids are studying this stuff and they've got the word  fluctus  up there. That's wrong. One dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life.  It fluctus up  Mama.  Hikuleo Fluctus. That's a little more flowing. Hikuleo sounds like a kind of a Leonardo DiCaprio    syllable thing. And that's the Tonga underworld. And one of my favorites is the Itoki Fluctus  who is the Nicaraguan goddess of insects  stars  and planets. Now  if you're a goddess of stars and planets wouldn't you relegate insects to somebody else   No  no  really  I'm so busy with the stars. Would you mind taking the insects  Thank you darling. Oh take the spiders too. I know they're not insects  but I don't care. Monkeys  chimps  just get rid of the hairy creatures.  Now  we're going to be going to Mars one day. And when we do  it's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names. So  you'll be on Mars  and you're at Hellespointica Depressio which has got to be a really  up  place. Yeah  I'm at the Depressio  and I want to get over to Amazonis so I plug it into the Mars map  and click the button and there's my directions. I go to Chrysokeras. Then to Niliacus Lacus  which is not a bad name. Niliacus Lacus  try to get the practice  slick a tick a bacus. That's a cool name. I will say that. So  I hold back a little of my venom for these astronomical misnomers. And then of course Arnon to Thoth. And of course there will be advertisements. This is from their rule book  the International Astronomical Union. And you know they're international because they put it  en Francais  as well. L'Union Astronomique Internationale  for those of you who don't speak French. I thought I'd translate for you. From the rulebook  Nomenclature is a tool. The first consideration  make it clear  simple and unambiguous. And I think that Djabran Fluctus  that fits that mode. That's simple  the goddess of goats  very simple. Djabran Fluctus.  Now  Frank is this clear to you  Djabran Fluctus    Yeah  that's the goat goddess right  The Abacazanian  It's clear to me.   Listen  I'm going back to the swamp mermaid. Can you call me in a little while   Also  from the actual document I highlighted a part I thought may be of interest. Anyone can suggest changing a name. So  I look to you  fellow member of the Earth community. We've got to change this stuff up fast. So  these are actual names of people that work there. I did some more investigation. These are more people working for this group. And  as you can see  they don't use their first names. These are people naming planets  and they won't use their first names. Something is askew here. Is it because his name is really Jupiter Blunck  Is that Ganymede Andromeda Burba  Is that Mars Ya Marov  I don't know. But it's investigative material  no doubt. There are some mapping people who do use their names. Witness please  Eugene Shoemaker  who  diligently  from a young boy decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies. Must have been a very interesting day in the Shoemaker house.  Mom  I want to make maps.   That's wonderful Eugene. You could make maps of Toronto.   No  I want to make maps of planets.   Yeah  go to your room.  Martians  Venusians  Jovians. We have names for places where people don't exist. That seems a little silly to me. There are no Jovians. Getting back to my premise  I used stamps  by the way  because you don't have to pay anybody for the rights. There is obviously Einstein  Niels Bohr  de Fermat's last theorem  and I'm not sure whether that's James Coburn or Richard Harris. It's definitely one of the two. I'm not really clear which one. But obviously the point is that numbers are maps. And within numbers  is there an underlying secret to the universe  That is the premise of this particular presentation. By the way  that's a natural picture of Saturn  no adjustments. I mean that's just beautiful. So beautiful that I will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet  and the day Saturday  named after it  wonderfully. So  formulas relate number to form. That's Euler  his formula was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory which is kind of cool  not that funny  but it is cool. He was also famous for having no body. Which a lot of you are like   How did he figure that out   He's got no body  no man  just a head floating high. Here comes Euler. And that's an icosahedron  which is one of the five sacred solids  very important shapes. You see the icosahedron again. The dodecahedron  it's dual. There is a dodecahedron which I had to do in my room last night. The five sacred solids  as you can see there. Which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads. Blue cheese  ranch  oil and vinegar  thousand islands and house. I suggest the house. The reality  now here is something important. What's important about this is these shapes are duals of each other. And you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other. So  the whole concept of branes in the universe  if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron this is a very good map of what could possibly be. And that is  of course  what we are here to talk about. What a coincidence  October  th  in France  Jean Pierre Luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron  based on information that they got from this probe. This would be a normal wave pattern. But what they're seeing  way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background  is this kind of odd undulation. It doesn't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be. So  you can kind of get an idea from this extrapolating that back under this huge picture  so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like. And judging from this  it looks a little like a cheeseburger. So  I'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger. And for me  that's a win win. Everybody goes  I'm happy. Better really hurry up. I just threw this in because as important as all of our intellectual abilities are  without heart and without love it's just    it's all meaningless. And that  to me  is really beautiful. Except for that creepy guy in the background. Getting back to the point of my particular presentation  Kepler  one of my great heroes  who realized that these five solids  which I spoke of earlier  were related somehow to the planets  but he couldn't prove it. It freaked him out. But it did lead to Newton discovering gravity. So  maps of things leading to organized understandings of the universe in which we emerge. Now this is Isaac from a Vietnamese stamp. I am not suggesting at all that my Vietnamese brothers and sisters could maybe use a little art class here and there. But ... that's not a good picture. Not a good picture. Now  my friends in the island of Nevis are a little better. Look at that  That's Isaac Newton. That guy is rockin'. What a handsome cat. Once again  Nicaragua let me down. And Copernicus looks like Johnny Carson  which is really weird. I don't get that at all. Once again  these guys rock it out. Isaac is kickin' ass. Man  he looks like a rock star. This is freaky is a major way. This is Sierra Leone. They got little babies in there  floating in there. Man. I don't really need to comment on this. But I didn't know that Isaac Newton was in the Moody Blues. Did you  When did this happen  It's a different kind of course. And they've got five apples  I mean these guys are extrapolating in realms that are not necessarily valid. Although five is a good number  of course. Ecuador  my friend Kepler  as you can see  they call him Juan. Juan  No  Johannes  not Juan. It wasn't Carlos Chaplain. It's wrong. Ren  Descartes  of course. Once again these Grenada people  this is like way too sick for anybody's imagination. He's all murky. There is little kids leaning on his leg  little ghosts flying around. We gotta clean this stuff up fast  ladies and gentlemen. This is  of course  the Cartesian coordinates. Once again  that's Sierra Leone. This is again  indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form  maps of the universe. Because that's why we're here  really  I think to figure stuff out and to love each other. Descartes.  Laughter  Before the horse.  Laughter  Now  Monaco took Descartes  and just flipped him around. Now  Monaco is problematic for me  and I'll show you why. Here is a map. All they have is a casino on it. And why Franklin Delano Roosevelt is on their map I don't even want to hazard a guess. But I'd say he'd been to Hellespointica Depressio recently. This is the flag of Monaco. Ladies and gentlemen  the flag of Indonesia. Please examine. Not sure how this came to be  but it's not right. In Monaco   No  what are you talking about  They are so different. Look  ours is more red  it's longer. They stole our flag  They stole our flag   Bode's law wasn't even his law. It was a guy named Titus. And the reason I just bring this up because it is a law that doesn't really work. That's Jude Law and some of his films recently didn't work. Just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted. And I wonder if the photographer said   Okay  Jude  could you touch your tooth  That's good.  Just a tip  if you're being photographed for press pictures  don't touch your teeth. Prime numbers  Gauss  one of my favorites. Golden section  I've been obsessed with this thing since before I was born. I know that scares a lot of you  but that was my purpose entirely. There we can see Fibonacci numbers related to the Golden Section  because Fibonacci and Golden Section relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter  as I refer to it. If Fibonacci had been on Paxil  that would be the Fibonacci series.  Ten milligram     milligram.   Leonardo  dinner's ready  put down those books and take your pills.   Yes  Mama.  Alright where is this going  That's a good question. Here is the premise that I began    years ago. If numbers can express the laws of this incredible universe that we live  I reason  through some sort of reverse engineering  we could extrapolate from them some basic structural element of this universe. And that's what I did. Twenty seven years ago I started working on this. And I tried to build a particle accelerator. And that didn't work out well. So  then I thought a calculator is a metaphor. I can just divide numbers  that's like atom smashing. That's what I did. That's how I found Moleeds. Moleeds are what I believe the thing that will allow string theory to be proved. They are the nodes on the string  patterns and relationships        . That was the first chart I came up with. You can see  even if you don't go for the numbers  the beauty of the symmetry. The numbers from one to     divided into six groups. Symmetry  pairs. Every top adds up to   . Bottom  all   . There is so many intricate relationships that I'm not going to go there now  because you would say   Hey  go back to the Fluctus part.  Circle of Fifths  acoustic harmony  geometric symmetry. I knew those two were related. Once again  the Cartesian kind of cross over. So  I said if I'm going to put a circle  see what kind of patterns I get  boom  the Red System. Look at that. You can't just make this stuff up  ladies and gentlemen. You can't just go around going   Oh  I'm going to put some triangles in a circle and they're going to be symmetrical. And they're all going to add up  and it's going to be  oh yeah  I figured that out.  This is beyond anything anybody could just make up. There is the Orange System. And you'll see over here  these are multiples of the number   . And they recapitulate that shape  even though that's a circle of nine and that's a circle of   . It's nuts. That's the Green System. It all folds in half on the Green System  right between    and   . The Blue System. The Violet. It's all there. Look at that  I mean you cannot make that stuff up. That just doesn't fall out of a tree  ladies and gentlemen. Twenty seven years of my life  And I'm presenting it here at TED. Why  Because this is the place if aliens land  I hope they come here.  We are going to destroy the Earth. Hmmm ... maybe not.  In this last year I have found these subsequent systems which allow for the mathematic possibilities of the Calabi Yau manifolds in a way that doesn't necessitate these little hidden dimensions. Which works mathematically  but it just doesn't seem God like to me. It just seems like it's not sexy and elegant  it's hidden. I don't want hidden  I want to see it. I found other pairs all have symmetry  even though  unlike the master one  their symmetry is split. Unbelievable. This is like crazy. Am I the only one that sees this  You know  I didn't just draw this in a day  by the way. You know  try making some charts like this at home. You gotta be accurate  There's measurement involved  increments. These are maps  by the way. Not stamps  but one day. Okay  I'm getting to the punch. Golden Ratio  it's crazy. And look at this  built within it is the Golden Ratio. I start looking at that  and look at them again. They start looking like planets. I go to JPL. I look at the orbits of the planets. I find    examples of it in our solar system. I never told anybody. This is the first thing. This could be history. Kepler was right. Eighteen and     the middle of the Moleeds   .    is the golden section. Multiply them together    .    x   .    is    .   . Which is .    different from the number of days in a year. Hey  you can't make this up. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. As a magician  I try to create images that make people stop and think. I also try to challenge myself to do things that doctors say are not possible. I was buried alive in New York City in a coffin  buried alive in a coffin in April        for a week. I lived there with nothing but water. And it ended up being so much fun that I decided I could pursue doing more of these things. The next one is I froze myself in a block of ice for three days and three nights in New York City. That one was way more difficult than I had expected. The one after that  I stood on top of a hundred foot pillar for    hours. I began to hallucinate so hard that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads. So  next I went to London. In London I lived in a glass box for    days with nothing but water. It was  for me  one of the most difficult things I'd ever done  but it was also the most beautiful. There was so many skeptics  especially the press in London  that they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me. So  I felt very validated when the New England Journal of Medicine actually used the research for science. My next pursuit was I wanted to see how long I could go without breathing  like how long I could survive with nothing  not even air. I didn't realize that it would become the most amazing journey of my life. As a young magician  I was obsessed with Houdini and his underwater challenges. So  I began  early on  competing against the other kids  seeing how long I could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe  you know  five times  while I stayed under on one breath. By the time I was a teenager  I was able to hold my breath for three minutes and    seconds. I would later find out that was Houdini's personal record. In      I heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river. He was underneath  not breathing for    minutes. When the rescue workers came  they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage. His core temperature had dropped to    degrees. As a magician  I think everything is possible. And I think if something is done by one person  it can be done by others. I started to think  if the boy could survive without breathing for that long  there must be a way that I could do it. So  I met with a top neurosurgeon. And I asked him  how long is it possible to go without breathing  like how long could I go without air  And he said to me that anything over six minutes you have a serious risk of hypoxic brain damage. So  I took that as a challenge  basically. My first try  I figured that I could do something similar  and I created a water tank  and I filled it with ice and freezing cold water. And I stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop. And I was shivering. In my first attempt to hold my breath  I couldn't even last a minute. So  I realized that was completely not going to work. I went to talk to a doctor friend    and I asked him   How could I do that    I want to hold my breath for a really long time. How could it be done   And he said   David  you're a magician  create the illusion of not breathing  it will be much easier.  So  he came up with this idea of creating a rebreather  with a CO  scrubber  which was basically a tube from Home Depot  with a balloon duct taped to it  that he thought we could put inside of me  and somehow be able to circulate the air and rebreathe with this thing in me. This is a little hard to watch. But this is that attempt. So  that clearly wasn't going to work. Then I actually started thinking about liquid breathing. There is a chemical that's called perflubron. And it's so high in oxygen levels that in theory you could breathe it. So  I got my hands on that chemical  filled the sink up with it  and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in  which was really impossible. It's basically like trying to breathe  as a doctor said  while having an elephant standing on your chest. So  that idea disappeared. Then I started thinking  would it be possible to hook up a heart lung bypass machine and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery  and then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood  Which was another insane idea  obviously. Then I thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas  to actually do it. To actually try to hold my breath past the point that doctors would consider you brain dead. So  I started researching into pearl divers. You know  because they go down for four minutes on one breath. And when I was researching pearl divers  I found the world of free diving. It was the most amazing thing that I ever discovered  pretty much. There is many different aspects to free diving. There is depth records  where people go as deep as they can. And then there is static apnea. That's holding your breath as long as you can in one place without moving. That was the one that I studied. The first thing that I learned is when you're holding your breath  you should never move at all  that wastes energy. And that depletes oxygen  and it builds up CO  in your blood. So  I learned never to move. And I learned how to slow my heart rate down. I had to remain perfectly still and just relax and think that I wasn't in my body  and just control that. And then I learned how to purge. Purging is basically hyperventilating. You blow in and out    You do that  you get lightheaded  you get tingling. And you're really ridding your body of CO . So  when you hold your breath  it's infinitely easier. Then I learned that you have to take a huge breath  and just hold and relax and never let any air out  and just hold and relax through all the pain. Every morning  this is for months  I would wake up and the first thing that I would do is I would hold my breath for  out of    minutes  I would hold my breath for    minutes. So  basically what that means is I would purge  I'd breathe really hard for a minute. And I would hold  immediately after  for five and a half minutes. Then I would breathe again for a minute  purging as hard as I can  then immediately after that I would hold again for five and a half minutes. I would repeat this process eight times in a row. Out of    minutes  you're only breathing for eight minutes. At the end of that you're completely fried  your brain. You feel like you're walking around in a daze. And you have these awful headaches. Basically  I'm not the best person to talk to when I'm doing that stuff. I started learning about the world record holder. His name is Tom Sietas. And this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath. He's six foot four. He's     pounds. And his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person. I'm six foot one  and fat. We'll say big boned. I had to drop    pounds in three months. So  everything that I put into my body  I considered as medicine. Every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value. I ate really small controlled portions throughout the day. And I started to really adapt my body.  Individual results may vary  The thinner I was  the longer I was able to hold my breath. And by eating so well and training so hard  my resting heart rate dropped to    beats per minute. Which is lower than most Olympic athletes. In four months of training  I was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes. I wanted to try holding my breath everywhere. I wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if I could slow my heart rate down under duress. I decided that I was going to break the world record live on prime time television. The world record was eight minutes and    seconds  held by Tom Sietas  that guy with the whale lungs I told you about. I assumed that I could put a water tank at Lincoln Center and if I stayed there a week not eating  I would get comfortable in that situation and I would slow my metabolism  which I was sure would help me hold my breath longer than I had been able to do it. I was completely wrong. I entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date. And I thought everything seemed to be on track. Two days before my big breath hold attempt  for the record  the producers of my television special thought that just watching somebody holding their breath  and almost drowning  is too boring for television. So  I had to add handcuffs  while holding my breath  to escape from. This was a critical mistake. Because of the movement  I was wasting oxygen. And by seven minutes I had gone into these awful convulsions. By       I started to black out. And by seven minutes and    seconds  they had to pull my body out and bring me back. I had failed on every level. So  naturally  the only way out of the slump that I could think of was  I decided to call Oprah. I told her that I wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had. This was a different record. This was a pure O  static apnea record that Guinness had set the world record at    minutes. So  basically you breathe pure O  first  oxygenating your body  flushing out CO   and you are able to hold much longer. I realized that my real competition was the beaver. In January of '    Oprah gave me four months to prepare and train. So  I would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night. A hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at        feet. So  it's like base camp  Everest. What that does is  you start building up the red bloodcell count in your body  which helps you carry oxygen better. Every morning  again  after getting out of that tent  your brain is completely wiped out. My first attempt on pure O   I was able to go up to    minutes. So  it was a pretty big success. The neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water because in his mind  at    minutes your brain is done  you're brain dead. So  he pulled me up  and I was fine. There was one person there that was definitely not impressed. It was my ex girlfriend. While I was breaking the record underwater for the first time  she was sifting through my Blackberry  checking all my messages. My brother had a picture of it. It is really    I then announced that I was going to go for Sietas' record  publicly. And what he did in response  is he went on Regis and Kelly  and broke his old record. Then his main competitor went out and broke his record. So  he suddenly pushed the record up to    minutes and    seconds. Which was three minutes longer than I had prepared. It was longer than the record. I wanted to get the Science Times to document this. I wanted to get them to do a piece on it. So  I did what any person seriously pursuing scientific advancement would do. I walked into the New York Times offices and did card tricks to everybody. So  I don't know if it was the magic or the lure of the Cayman Islands  but John Tierney flew down and did a piece on the seriousness of breath holding. While he was there  I tried to impress him  of course. And I did a dive down to     feet  which is basically the height of a    story building  and as I was coming up  I blacked out underwater  which is really dangerous  that's how you drown. Luckily  Kirk had seen me and he swam over and pulled me up. So  I started full focus. I completely trained to get my breath hold time up for what I needed to do. But there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it  being on Oprah. But in practice  I would do it face down  floating on the pool. But for TV they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face  basically. The other problem was the suit was so buoyant that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up. So  I had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose  which was a real problem for me. That made me extremely nervous  raising the heart rate. Then  what they also did was  which we never did before  is there was a heart rate monitor. And it was right next to the sphere. So  every time my heart would beat  I'd hear the beep beep beep beep  you know  the ticking  really loud. Which was making me more nervous. And there was no way to slow my heart rate down. Normally  I would start at    beats per minute  and while holding my breath  it would drop to    beats per minute  which is pretty unusual. This time it started at     beats  and it never went down. I spent the first five minutes underwater desperately trying to slow my heart rate down. I was just sitting there thinking   I've got to slow this down. I'm going to fail.  And I was getting more nervous. And the heart rate just kept going up and up  all the way up to     beats. Basically it's the same thing that created my downfall at Lincoln Center. It was a waste of O . When I made it to the halfway mark  at eight minutes  I was     percent certain that I was not going to be able to make this. There was no way for me to do it. I figured  Oprah had dedicated an hour to doing this breath hold thing  if I had cracked early  it would be a whole show about how depressed I am. So  I figured I'm better off just fighting and staying there until I black out  at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that. I kept pushing to    minutes. At    minutes you start getting all these really strong tingling sensations in your fingers and toes. And I knew that that was blood shunting  when the blood rushes away from your extremities to provide oxygen to your vital organs. At    minutes I started feeling throbbing sensations in my legs  and my lips started to feel really strange. At minute    I started to have ringing in my ears  and I started to feel my arm going numb. And I'm a hypochondriac  and I remember arm numb means heart attack. So  I started to really get really paranoid. Then at    minutes  maybe because of the hypochondria  I started feeling pains all over my chest. It was awful. At    minutes  I had these awful contractions  like this urge to breathe. At    minutes I was suffering major O  deprivation to the heart. And I started having ischemia to the heart. My heartbeat would go from     to     to      to     to     to     again. It would skip a beat. It would start. It would stop. And I felt all this. And I was sure that I was going to have a heart attack. So  at    minutes what I did is I slid my feet out because I knew that if I did go out  if I did have a heart attack  they'd have to jump into the binding and take my feet out before pulling me up. I was really nervous. I let my feet out  and I started floating to the top. And I didn't take my head out. But I was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop  just waiting. They had doctors with the  Pst   you know  sitting there waiting. And then suddenly I hear screaming. And I think that there is some weird thing    that I had died or something had happened. And then I realized that I had made it to      . So  with the energy of everybody that was there  I decided to keep pushing. And I went to    minutes and four seconds. As though that wasn't enough  what I did immediately after is I went to Quest Labs and had them take every blood sample that they could to test for everything and to see where my levels were  so the doctors could use it  once again. I also didn't want anybody to question it. I had the world record and I wanted to make sure it was legitimate. So  I get to New York City the next day  I'm walking out of the Apple store  and this kid walks up to me he's like   Yo  D   I'm like  Yeah   He said   If you really held your breath that long  why'd you come out of the water dry   I was like  What   And that's my life. So    As a magician  I try to show things to people that seem impossible. And I think magic  whether I'm holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards  is pretty simple. It's practice  it's training  and it's     Sobs  It's practice  it's training and experimenting  while pushing through the pain to be the best that I can be. And that's what magic is to me  so  thank you. Right now is the most exciting time to see new Indian art. Contemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world like never before. I thought it might be interesting  even for the many long time collectors here with us at TED  local collectors  to have an outside view of    young Indian artists I wish everyone at TED to know. The first is Bharti Kher. The central motif of Bharti's practice is the ready made store bought bindi that untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads  every day  in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage. But originally the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye between the spiritual world and the religious world. Bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche  as she calls it  by exploding it into something spectacular. She also creates life size fiberglass sculptures  often of animals  which she then completely covers in bindis  often with potent symbolism. She says she first got started with    packets of bindis  and then wondered what she could do with    thousand. Our next artist  Balasubramaniam  really stands at the crossroads of sculpture  painting and installation  working wonders with fiberglass. Since Bala himself will be speaking at TED I won't spend too much time on him here today  except to say that he really succeeds at making the invisible visible. Brooklyn based Chitra Ganesh is known for her digital collages  using Indian comic books called amar chitra kathas as her primary source material. These comics are a fundamental way that children  especially in the diaspora  learn their religious and mythological folk tales. I  for one  was steeped in these. Chitra basically remixes and re titles these iconic images to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics embedded in these deeply influential comics. And she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well. Jitish Kallat successfully practices across photography  sculpture  painting and installation. As you can see  he's heavily influenced by graffiti and street art  and his home city of Mumbai is an ever present element in his work. He really captures that sense of density and energy which really characterizes modern urban Bombay. He also creates phantasmagoric sculptures made of bones from cast resin. Here he envisions the carcass of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot. This next artist  N.S. Harsha  actually has a studio right here in Mysore. He's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition. He creates these fine  delicate images which he then repeats on a massive scale. He uses scale to more and more spectacular effect  whether on the roof of a temple in Singapore  or in his increasingly ambitious installation work  here with     functioning sewing machines  fabricating the flags of every member of the United Nations. Mumbai based Dhruvi Acharya builds on her love of comic books and street art to comment on the roles and expectations of modern Indian women. She too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas  but in a very different way than Chitra Ganesh. In this particular work  she actually strips out the images and leaves the actual text to reveal something previously unseen  and provocative. Raqib Shaw is Kolkata born  Kashmir raised  and London trained. He too is reinventing the miniature tradition. He creates these opulent tableaus inspired by Hieronymus Bosch  but also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth. He actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work using porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect. I'm kind of cheating with this next artist since Raqs Media Collective are really three artists working together. Raqs are probably the foremost practitioners of multimedia art in India today  working across photography  video and installation. They frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization  and their home of Delhi is a frequent element in their work. Here  they invite the viewer to analyze a crime looking at evidence and clues embedded in five narratives on these five different screens  in which the city itself may have been the culprit. This next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary Indian art  Subodh Gupta. He was first known for creating giant photo realistic canvases  paintings of everyday objects  the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every Indian. He celebrates these local and mundane objects globally  and on a grander and grander scale  by incorporating them into ever more colossal sculptures and installations. And finally number     last and certainly not least  Ranjani Shettar  who lives and works here in the state of Karnataka  creates ethereal sculptures and installations that really marry the organic to the industrial  and brings  like Subodh  the local global. These are actually wires wrapped in muslin and steeped in vegetable dye. And she arranges them so that the viewer actually has to navigate through the space  and interact with the objects. And light and shadow are a very important part of her work. She also explores themes of consumerism  and the environment  such as in this work  where these basket like objects look organic and woven  and are woven  but with the strips of steel  salvaged from cars that she found in a Bangalore junkyard.    artists  six minutes  I know that was a lot to take in. But I can only hope I've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in India today. Thank you very much for looking and listening. This is actually a painting that hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School. And it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted. In the front  you see  actually  Joe Murray getting the patient ready for the transplant  while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison  the Chief of Urology at Harvard  actually harvesting the kidney. The kidney was indeed the first organ ever to be transplanted to the human. That was back in          years ago. Yet we're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges as many decades ago. Certainly many advances  many lives saved. But we have a major shortage of organs. In the last decade the number of patients waiting for a transplant has doubled. While  at the same time  the actual number of transplants has remained almost entirely flat. That really has to do with our aging population. We're just getting older. Medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive. But as we age  our organs tend to fail more. So  that's a challenge  not just for organs but also for tissues. Trying to replace pancreas  trying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson's. These are major issues. This is actually a very stunning statistic. Every    seconds a patient dies from diseases that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement. So  what can we do about it  We've talked about stem cells tonight. That's a way to do it. But still ways to go to get stem cells into patients  in terms of actual therapies for organs. Wouldn't it be great if our bodies could regenerate  Wouldn't it be great if we could actually harness the power of our bodies  to actually heal ourselves  It's not really that foreign of a concept  actually  it happens on the Earth every day. This is actually a picture of a salamander. Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate. You see here a little video. This is actually a limb injury in this salamander. And this is actually real photography  timed photography  showing how that limb regenerates in a period of days. You see the scar form. And that scar actually grows out a new limb. So  salamanders can do it. Why can't we  Why can't humans regenerate  Actually  we can regenerate. Your body has many organs and every single organ in your body has a cell population that's ready to take over at the time of injury. It happens every day. As you age  as you get older. Your bones regenerate every    years. Your skin regenerates every two weeks. So  your body is constantly regenerating. The challenge occurs when there is an injury. At the time of injury or disease  the body's first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body. It basically wants to fight off infection  and seal itself  whether it's organs inside your body  or your skin  the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in  to seal itself off from the outside. So  how can we harness that power  One of the ways that we do that is actually by using smart biomaterials. How does this work  Well  on the left side here you see a urethra which was injured. This is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body. And you see that it is injured. We basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials that you can actually use as a bridge. If you build that bridge  and you close off from the outside environment  then you can create that bridge  and cells that regenerate in your body  can then cross that bridge  and take that path. That's exactly what you see here. It's actually a smart biomaterial that we used  to actually treat this patient. This was an injured urethra on the left side. We used that biomaterial in the middle. And then  six months later on the right hand side you see this reengineered urethra. Turns out your body can regenerate  but only for small distances. The maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter. So  we can use these smart biomaterials but only for about one centimeter to bridge those gaps. So  we do regenerate  but for limited distances. What do we do now  if you have injury for larger organs  What do we do when we have injuries for structures which are much larger than one centimeter  Then we can start to use cells. The strategy here  is if a patient comes in to us with a diseased or injured organ  you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ  less than half the size of a postage stamp  you can then tease that tissue apart  and look at its basic components  the patient's own cells  you take those cells out  grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities  and then we then use scaffold materials. To the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse  or your shirt  but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body. It disintegrates a few months later. It's acting only as a cell delivery vehicle. It's bringing the cells into the body. It's allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue  and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away. And that's what we did for this piece of muscle. This is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle. We take the cells  we expand them  we place the cells on the scaffold  and we then place the scaffold back into the patient. But actually  before placing the scaffold into the patient  we actually exercise it. We want to make sure that we condition this muscle  so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient. That's what you're seeing here. You're seeing this muscle bio reactor actually exercising the muscle back and forth. Okay. These are flat structures that we see here  the muscle. What about other structures  This is actually an engineered blood vessel. Very similar to what we just did  but a little bit more complex. Here we take a scaffold  and we basically    scaffold can be like a piece of paper here. And we can then tubularize this scaffold. And what we do is we  to make a blood vessel  same strategy. A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types. We take muscle cells  we paste  or coat the outside with these muscle cells  very much like baking a layer cake  if you will. You place the muscle cells on the outside. You place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside. You now have your fully seeded scaffold. You're going to place this in an oven like device. It has the same conditions as a human body     degrees centigrade     percent oxygen. You then exercise it  as what you saw on that tape. And on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered. This is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain. And this is an X ray showing you the patent  functional blood vessel. More complex structures such as blood vessels  urethras  which I showed you  they're definitely more complex because you're introducing two different cell types. But they are really acting mostly as conduits. You're allowing fluid or air to go through at steady states. They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs. Hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity  because you're asking these organs to act on demand. So  the bladder is one such organ. Same strategy  we take a very small piece of the bladder  less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components  muscle  and these bladder specialized cells. We grow the cells outside the body in large quantities. It takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ. We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder. We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells. We coat the outside with these muscle cells. We place it back into this oven like device. From the time you take that piece of tissue  six to eight weeks later you can put the organ right back into the patient. This actually shows the scaffold. The material is actually being coated with the cells. When we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient. We brought patients in  six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery  did X rays  and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient's size pelvic cavity. For the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes  small  medium  large and extra large. It's true. And I'm sure everyone here wanted an extra large. Right  So  bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures. But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it. This is actually a heart valve  which we engineered. And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy. We take the scaffold  we seed it with cells  and you can now see here  the valve leaflets opening and closing. We exercise these prior to implantation. Same strategy. And then the most complex are the solid organs. For solid organs  they're more complex because you're using a lot more cells per centimeter. This is actually a simple solid organ like the ear. It's now being seeded with cartilage. That's the oven like device  once it's coated it gets placed there. And then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold. This is actually digits that we're engineering. These are being layered  one layer at a time  first the bone  we fill in the gaps with cartilage. We then start adding the muscle on top. And you start layering these solid structures. Again  fairly more complex organs  but by far  the most complex solid organs are actually the vascularized  highly vascularized  a lot of blood vessel supply  organs such as the heart  the liver  the kidneys. This is actually an example    several strategies to engineer solid organs. This is actually one of the strategies. We use a printer. And instead of using ink  we use    you just saw an inkjet cartridge    we just use cells. This is actually your typical desktop printer. It's actually printing this two chamber heart  one layer at a time. You see the heart coming out there. It takes about    minutes to print  and about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract. This technology was developed by Tao Ju  who worked at our institute. And this is actually still  of course  experimental  not for use in patients. Another strategy that we have followed is actually to use decellularized organs. We actually take donor organs  organs that are discarded  and we then can use very mild detergents to take all the cell elements out of these organs. So  for example on the left panel  top panel  you see a liver. We actually take the donor liver  we use very mild detergents  and we  by using these mild detergents  we take all the cells out of the liver. Two weeks later  we basically can lift this organ up  it feels like a liver  we can hold it like a liver  it looks like a liver  but it has no cells. All we are left with is the skeleton  if you will  of the liver  all made up of collagen  a material that's in our bodies  that will not reject. We can use it from one patient to the next. We then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply. You can see  actually that's a fluoroscopy. We're actually injecting contrast into the organ. Now you can see it start. We're injecting the contrast into the organ into this decellularized liver. And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact. We then take the cells  the vascular cells  blood vessel cells  we perfuse the vascular tree with the patient's own cells. We perfuse the outside of the liver with the patient's own liver cells. And we can then create functional livers. And that's actually what you're seeing. This is still experimental. But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure  experimentally. For the kidney  as I talked to you about the first painting that you saw  the first slide I showed you     percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a kidney     percent. So  another strategy we're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together  like an accordion  if you will. So  we stack these wafers together  using the kidney cells. And then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've engineered. They are actually making urine. Again  small structures  our challenge is how to make them larger  and that is something we're working on right now at the institute. One of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then is what is a strategy that we're going for in regenerative medicine. If at all possible  we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs. We are limited with distances right now  but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time. If we cannot use smart biomaterials  then we'd rather use your very own cells. Why  Because they will not reject. We can take cells from you  create the structure  put it right back into you  they will not reject. And if possible  we'd rather use the cells from your very specific organ. If you present with a diseased wind pipe we'd like to take cells from your windpipe. If you present with a diseased pancreas we'd like to take cells from that organ. Why  Because we'd rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want. A windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell. We don't need to teach it to become another cell type. So  we prefer organ specific cells. And today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body  except for several which we still need stem cells for  like heart  liver  nerve and pancreas. And for those we still need stem cells. If we cannot use stem cells from your body then we'd like to use donor stem cells. And we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors. And we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago  stem cells from the amniotic fluid  and the placenta  which have those properties. So  at this point  I do want to tell you that some of the major challenges we have. You know  I just showed you this presentation  everything looks so good  everything works. Actually no  these technologies really are not that easy. Some of the work you saw today was performed by over     researchers at our institute across a    year time span. So  these are very tough technologies. Once you get the formula right you can replicate it. But it takes a lot to get there. So  I always like to show this cartoon. This is how to stop a runaway stage. And there you see the stagecoach driver  and he goes  on the top panel  He goes A  B  C  D  E  F. He finally stops the runaway stage. And those are usually the basic scientists  The bottom is usually the surgeons. I'm a surgeon so that's not that funny. But actually method A is the correct approach. And what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies to the clinic  we've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients. And when we launch these technologies to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question. Are you ready to place this in your own loved one  your own child  your own family member  and then we proceed. Because our main goal  of course  is first  to do no harm. I'm going to show you now  a very short clip  It's a five second clip of a patient who received one of the engineered organs. We started implanting some of these structures over    years ago. So  we have patients now walking around with organs  engineered organs  for over    years  as well. I'm going to show a clip of one young lady. She had a spina bifida defect  a spinal cord abnormality. She did not have a normal bladder. This is a segment from CNN. We are just taking five seconds. This is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of. Video  Kaitlyn M  I'm happy. I was always afraid that I was going to have like  an accident or something. And now I can just go and go out with my friends  go do whatever I want. Anthony Atala  See  at the end of the day  the promise of regenerative medicine is a single promise. And that is really very simple  to make our patients better. Thank you for your attention. Can geographic information make you healthy  In      I got hit by a train. My train was a heart attack. I found myself in a hospital in an intensive care ward  recuperating from emergency surgery. And I suddenly realized something  that I was completely in the dark. I started asking my questions   Well  why me    Why now    Why here    Could my doctor have warned me   So  what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health. Genetics  lifestyle and environment. That's going to sort of contain our risks  and if we manage those risks we're going to live a good life and a good healthy life. Well  I understand the genetics and lifestyle part. And you know why I understand that  Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this. Have you ever had to fill out those long  legal size forms in your doctor's office  I mean  if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once  right  Do it over and over again. And they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history  your medication history  your surgical history  your allergy history ... did I forget any history  But this part of the equation I didn't really get  and I don't think my physicians really get this part of the equation. What does that mean  my environment  Well  it can mean a lot of things. This is my life. These are my life places. We all have these. While I'm talking I'd like you to also be thinking about  How many places have you lived  Just think about that  you know  wander through your life thinking about this. And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places. You spend it at rest and you spend it at work. And if you're like me  you're in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place. So  it's not really simple when somebody asks you   Where do you live  where do you work  and where do you spend all your time  And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don't even see   Well  when I have done this on myself  I always come to the conclusion that I spend about    percent of my time relatively in a small number of places. And I don't wander far from that place for a majority of my time  even though I'm an extensive global trekker. Now  I'm going to take you on a little journey here. I started off in Scranton  Pennsylvania. I don't know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania  but this is where I spent my first    years with my little young lungs. You know  breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide  carbon dioxide and methane gas  in unequal quantities       years of this. And if you've been in that part of the country  this is what those piles of burning  smoldering coal waste look like. So then I decided to leave that part of the world  and I was going to go to the mid west. OK  so I ended up in Louisville  Kentucky. Well  I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown. They manufacture plastics. They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene. Okay  I spent    years  in my middle age lungs now  breathing various concentrations of that. And on a clear day it always looked like this  so you never saw it. It was insidious and it was really happening. Then I decided I had to get really smart  I would take this job in the West Coast. And I moved to Redlands California. Very nice  and there my older  senior lungs  as I like to call them  I filled with particulate matter  carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone. Okay  Almost like the highest in the nation. Alright  this is what it looks like on a good day. If you've been there  you know what I'm talking about. So  what's wrong with this picture  Well  the picture is  there is a huge gap here. The one thing that never happens in my doctor's office  They never ask me about my place history. No doctor  can I remember  ever asking me   Where have you lived   They haven't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach. They really don't do that. It's missing. Look at the kind of data that's available. This data's from all over the world    countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research. Now  I've circled the places where I've been. Well  by design  if I wanted to have a heart attack I'd been in the right places. Right  So  how many people are in the white  How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space  Anybody  Boy you're lucky. How many have spent it in the red places  Oh  not so lucky. There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world. They give us some sense of what's going to be our train wreck. But none of that's in my medical record. And it's not in yours either. So  here's my friend Paul. He's a colleague. He allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours            days out of the year for the last two years  everywhere he went. And you can see he's been to a few places around the United States. And this is where he has spent most of his time. If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do. Anybody got any clues  Ski. Right. We can zoom in here  and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time. And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA. Did you know that data existed  For every community in the United States  you could have your own personalized map of that. So  our cell phones can now build a place history. This is how Paul did it. He did it with his iPhone. This might be what we end up with. This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter. Right  This could be my little assessment. And he looks at that and he says   Whoa Bill  I suggest that maybe you not decide  just because you're out here in beautiful California  and it's warm every day  that you get out and run at six o'clock at night. I'd suggest that that's a bad idea Bill  because of this report.  What I'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions. Okay  number one is  we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information. It's called geomedicine. There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this. And they're in the early stages of development. These programs need to be supported  and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I've shared here with you today. The second thing we need to do is while we're spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record  we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record. It not only will be important for the physician  it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon. But it will also be useful for us. I could have made the decision  if I had this information  not to move to the ozone capital of the United States  couldn't I  I could make that decision. Or I could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company. With that  I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost    years ago. Just look at that for a minute. That was what the conclusion of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about  was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease  in illness  in wellness  and how our healthcare system actually operates. That was what he was talking about on that quote. And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago. So  I'd very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records. So with that  I'll leave you that in my particular view of view of health  Geography always matters. And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy. Thank you. I'm going to speak to you today about architectural agency. What I mean by that is that it's time for architecture to do things again  not just represent things. This is a construction helmet that I received two years ago at the groundbreaking of the largest project I  and my firm  have ever been involved in. I was thrilled to get it. I was thrilled to be the only person standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet. I thought it represented the importance of the architect. I stayed thrilled until I got home  threw the helmet onto my bed  fell down onto my bed and realized inside there was an inscription. Now  I think that this is a great metaphor for the state of architecture and architects today. We are for decorative purposes only. Now  who do we have to blame  We can only blame ourselves. Over the last    years the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex and has gotten much more litigious. And we architects are cowards. So  as we have faced liability  we have stepped back and back  and unfortunately  where there is liability  guess what there is  power. So  eventually we have found ourselves in a totally marginalized position  way over here. Now  what did we do  We're cowards  but we're smart cowards. And so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture. And we announced   Hey  architecture  it's over here  in this autonomous language we're going to seed control of processes.  And we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession. We actually created an artificial schism between creation and execution  as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute and as if you could actually execute without knowing how to create. Now  something else happened. And that's when we began to sell the world that architecture was created by individuals creating genius sketches. And that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided  but we would merely write it off as merely execution. Now I'd argue that that is as absurd as stating that    minutes of copulation is the creative act  and nine months of gestation  and  God forbid     hours of child labor is merely execution. So  what do we architects need to do  We need to stitch back creation and execution. And we need to start authoring processes again instead of authoring objects. Now  if we do this  I believe we can go back    years and start reinjecting agency  social engineering  back into architecture. Now  there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do  like managing contracts  learning how to write contracts  understanding procurement processes  understanding the time value of money and cost estimation. But I'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process  into three very pedantic statements. The first is  Take core positions with your client. I know it's shocking  right  that architecture would actually say that. The second position is  Actually take positions. Take joint positions with your client. This is the moment in which you as the architect and your client can begin to inject vision and agency. But it has to be done together. And then only after this is done are you allowed to do this  begin to put forward architectural manifestations that manifest those positions. And both owner and architect alike are empowered to critique those manifestations based on the positions that you've taken. Now  I believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this. I'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control. You do not know what the end result is. But I promise you  with enough brain power and enough passion and enough commitment  you will arrive at conclusions that will transcend convention  and will simply be something that you could not have initially or individually conceived of. Alright  now I'm going to reduce all of this to a series of simple dumb sketches. This is the modus operandi that we have today. We roll     foot Spartan  i.e. our vision  up to our clients' gates of Troy. And we don't understand why they won't let us in. Right  Well  how about instead of doing that  we roll up to the gates something they want. Now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor  because of course we all know that inside of the Trojan Horse were a bunch of people with spears. So  we can change the metaphor. Let's call the Trojan Horse the vessel by which you get through the gate  get through the constraints of a project. At which point  you and your client have the ability to start considering what you're going to put inside that vessel  the agency  the vision. And if you do that  you do that responsibly  I believe that instead of delivering Spartans  you can deliver maidens. And if I could summarize that all up into one single sketch it would be this. If we are so good at our craft shouldn't we be able to conceive of an architectural manifestation that slides seamlessly through the project's and the client's constraints  Now  with that in mind  I'm going to show a project that's very dear to many people in this room   well  maybe not dear  but certainly close to many people in this room. And that's a project that is just about to open next week  the new home for the Dallas Theater Center  the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre. Now  I'm going to present it on the same terms  issue  position and architectural manifestation. Now  the first issue that we faced was that the Dallas Theater Center had a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect of some place outside of the triumvirate of New York  Chicago and Seattle. And this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership. But it also had to do with something rather unusual  and that was this horrible little building that they'd been performing in. Why was this horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation  Because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building. When you're on Broadway  you cannot tear the proscenium down. This building  when an artistic director wanted to do a  Cherry Orchard  and wanted people and wanted people to come out of a well on the stage  they brought a backhoe in  and they simply dug the hole. Well  that's exciting. And you can start to get the best artistic directors  scenic designers and actors from around the country to come to perform here because you can do things you can't do elsewhere. So  the first position we took was   Hey  we as architects had better not show up and do a pristine building that doesn't engender the same freedoms that this old dilapidated shed provided the company.  The second issue is a nuance of the first. And that's that the company and the building was multiform. That meant that they were able to perform  as long as they had labor they were able to go between proscenium  thrust  flat floor  arena  traverse  you name it. All they needed was labor. Well  something happened. In fact something happened to all institutions around the world. It started to become hard to raise operational costs  operational budgets. So  they stopped having inexpensive labor. And eventually they had to freeze their organization into something called a bastardized thruscenium. So  the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided  the ability to move between stage configurations  had better be able to be done without relying on operational costs. Alright  Affordably. The architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb. It was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house and redefine them as above house and below house. At first blush you think   Hey it's crazy  what could you possibly gain   We created what we like to call superfly. Now  superfly  the concept is you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower  and you smear them across flytower and auditorium. Suddenly the artistic director can move between different stage and audience configurations. And because that flytower has the ability to pick up all the pristine elements  suddenly the rest of the environment can be provisional. And you can drill  cut  nail  screw paint and replace  with a minimum of cost. But there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move that was unexpected. And that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium in a most unusual way. And that provided the artistic director suddenly the ability to define suspension of disbelief. So  the building affords artistic directors the freedom to conceive of almost any kind of activity underneath this floating object. But also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief such that in the last act of Macbeth  if he or she wants you to associate the parable that you're seeing with Dallas  with your real life  he or she can do so. Now  in order to do this we and the clients had to do something fairly remarkable. In fact it really was the clients who had to do it. They had to make a decision  based on the positions we took to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital A architecture and one third infrastructure  to actually the inverse  two thirds infrastructure and one third capital A architecture. That's a lot for a client to commit to before you actually see the fruition of the concept. But based on the positions  they took the educated leap of faith to do so. And effectively we created what we like to call a theater machine. Now  that theater machine has ability to move between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button and a few stagehands in a short amount of time. But it also has the potential to not only provide multiform but multi processional sequences. Meaning  The artistic director doesn't necessarily need to go through our lobby. One of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters is they hate us architects  because they say the first thing they have to do  the first five minutes of any show  is they have to get our architecture out of the mind of their patron. Well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture. So  in fact  there is the building  there is what we call the draw. You're going down into our lobby  go through the lobby with our own little dangly bits  whether you like them or not  up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium. But there is also the potential to allow people to move directly from the outside  in this case suggesting kind of Wagnerian entrance  into the interior of the auditorium. And here is the fruition of that in actuality. These are the two large pivoting doors that allow people to move directly from the outside  in or from the inside  out  performers or audience alike. Now  imagine what that could be. I have to say honestly this is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long. But imagine the freedoms if you could take this further  that in fact you could consider a Wagnerian entry  a first act in thrust  an intermission in Greek  a second act in arena  and you leave through our lobby with dangly bits. Now that  I would say  is architecture performing. It is taking the hand of the architect to actually remove the hand of the architect in favor of the hand of the artistic director. I'll go through the three basic configurations. This is the flat floor configuration. You notice that there is no proscenium  the balconies have been raised up  there are no seats  the floor in the auditorium is flat. The first configuration is easy to understand. The balconies come down  you see that the orchestra begins to have a rake that's frontal towards the end stage  and the seats come in. The third configuration is a little harder to understand. Here you see that the balconies actually have to move out of the way in order to bring a thrust into the space. And some of the seats need to actually change their direction  and change their rake  to allow that to happen. I'll do it again so you can see it. There you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium. And there it is in the thrust configuration. In order to do that  again  we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks. And they told us one important thing   You shall not beta test.  Meaning  nothing that we do can we be the first ones to do it. But they were willing for us to apply technologies from other areas that already had failsafe mechanisms to this building. And the solution in terms of the balconies was to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift. Now  if you were to take a scoreboard and drop it on dirt and whiskey  that would be bad. If you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena and be able to do the Ice Capades the next night  that would also be bad. And so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms and allowed the theater and our client to actually do this with confidence that they would be able to change over their configurations at will. The second technology that we applied was actually using things that you know from the stage side of an opera house. In this case what we're doing is we're taking the orchestra floor  lifting it up  spinning it  changing the rake  taking it back to flat floor  changing the rake again. In essence  you can begin to define rakes and viewing angles of people in the orchestra seating  at will. Here you see the chairs being spun around to go from proscenium or end stage to thrust configuration. The proscenium  also. As far as we know this is the first building in the world in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space. Here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium. And ultimately  up in the flytower  the scene sets that allow the transformations to occur. As I said  all that was in service of creating a flexible yet affordable configuration. But we got this other benefit  and that was the ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage Dallas on the outside. Here you see the building in its current state with blinds closed. This is a trompe l'oeil. Actually this is not a curtain. These are vinyl blinds that are integrated into the windows themselves  again with failsafe mechanisms that can be lifted such that you can completely demystify  if you chose  the operations of the theater going on behind  rehearsals and so forth. But you also have the ability to allow the audience to see Dallas  to perform with Dallas as the backdrop of your performance. Now  if I'll take you through    this is an early concept sketch    take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together. Effectively you would have something like this. You would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber   Aida   their elephants  you can bring the elephants in. You would be able to expose the auditorium to Dallas or vice versa  Dallas to the auditorium. You'd be able to open portions in order to change the procession  allow people to come in and out for an intermission  or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance. As I said  all the balconies can move  but they can also be disappeared completely. The proscenium can fly. You can bring large objects into the chamber itself. But most convincingly when we had to confront the idea of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure  is something that is represented by this. And again  this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built  but at least suggests the ideas. This building has the ability  in short order  to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out. Now  if there is anyone here from American Airlines  please consider doing your Christmas party here. That allows the company to raise operational budgets without having to compete with other venues with much larger auditoriums. That's an enormous benefit. So  the theater company has the ability to do totally hermetic  light controlled  sound controlled  great acoustics  great intimacy Shakespeare  but can also do Beckett with the skyline of Dallas sitting behind it. Here it is in a flat floor configuration. The theater has been going through its kind of paces. Here it is in an end stage configuration. It's actually beautiful. There was a rock band. We stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked  and you could see the guys doing this but you couldn't hear them. It was very unusual. Here it is in a thrust configuration. And last but not least  you see this already has the ability to create events in order to generate operational budgets to overcome the building in fact performing to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem. I'm going to show you a brief time lapse. As I said  this can be done with only two people  and with a minimum amount of time. This is the first time that actually the changeover was done and so there is literally thousands of people because everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it. So  in a way try to disregard all the thousands of ants running around. And think of it being done with just a few people. Again  just a couple people are required. I promise. Et voila. So  just in conclusion  a few shots. This is the AT T Performing Arts Center's Dee and Charles Wyly Theater. There it is at night. And last but not least the entire AT T Performing Arts Center. You can see the Winspear Opera House on the right and the Dee and Charles Wyly Theater on the left. And to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something. But we got to that conclusion without understanding where we were going  what we knew were a series of issues that the company and the client was confronted with. And we took positions with them  and it was through those positions that we began to take architectural manifestations and we arrived at a conclusion that none of us  really none of us could ever have conceived of initially or individually. Thank you. Namaste. Good morning. I'm very happy to be here in India. And I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned over these last particularly    years with V Day and  The Vagina Monologues   traveling the world  essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women. What I want to talk about today is this particular cell  or grouping of cells  that is in each and every one of us. And I want to call it the girl cell. And it's in men as well as in women. I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race. And I want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell  the oppression of these cells  the reinterpretation of these cells  the undermining of these cells  getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing  eradicating  destroying  reducing these cells  basically began the process of killing off the girl cell  which was  by the way  patriarchy. I want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness. And it is essential to balance  to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us. And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell is compassion  and it's empathy  and it's passion itself  and it's vulnerability  and it's openness  and it's intensity  and it's association  and it's relationship  and it is intuitive. And then let's think how compassion informs wisdom  and that vulnerability is our greatest strength  and that emotions have inherent logic  which lead to radical  appropriate  saving action. And then let's remember that we've been taught the exact opposite by the powers that be  that compassion clouds your thinking  that it gets in the way  that vulnerability is weakness  that emotions are not to be trusted  and you're not supposed to take things personally  which is one of my favorites. I think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl. How do we bring up boys  What does it mean to be a boy  To be a boy really means not to be a girl. To be a man means not to be a girl. To be a woman means not to be a girl. To be strong means not to be a girl. To be a leader means not to be a girl. I actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we've had to train everyone not to be that. And I'd also like to say that the irony of course  is that denying girl  suppressing girl  suppressing emotion  refusing feeling has lead thus here. Where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence  the most horrific poverty  genocide  mass rapes  the destruction of the Earth  is completely out of control. And because we have suppressed our girl cells and suppressed our girl ship  we do not feel what is going on. So  we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening. I want to talk a little bit about the Democratic Republic of Congo. For me  it was the turning point of my life. I have spent a lot of time there in the last three years. I feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world  a lot of violence. I essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last    years. But the Democratic Republic of Congo really was the turning point in my soul. I went and I spent time in a place called Bukavu in a hospital called the Panzi Hospital  with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I've ever met. His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege. In the Congo  for those of you who don't know  there has been a war raging for the last    years  a war that has killed nearly six million people. It is estimated that somewhere between         and         women have been raped there. When I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital I sat with women who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories. Their stories were so horrific  and so mind blowing and so on the other side of human existence  that to be perfectly honest with you  I was shattered. And I will tell you that what happened is through that shattering  listening to the stories of eight year old girls who had their insides eviscerated  who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them so they had holes  literally  inside them where their pee and poop came out of them. Listening to the story of    year old women who were tied to chains and circled  and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically  all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them. My mind was so shattered. But what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way I have never been emboldened. That shattering  that opening of my girl cell  that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous  and braver  and actually more clever than I had been in the past in my life. I want to say that I think the powers that be know that empire building is actually    that feelings get in the way of empire building. Feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth  and excavating the Earth  and destroying things. I remember  for example  when my father  who was very  very violent  used to beat me. And he would actually say  while he was beating me   Don't you cry. Don't you dare cry.  Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him. And even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded of what he was doing. I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell. And I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women. And I think in some ways we've been much harsher to men in the annihilation of their girl cell. I see how boys have been brought up  and I see this across the planet  to be tough  to be hardened  to distance themselves from their tenderness  to not cry. I actually realized once in Kosovo  when I watched a man break down  that bullets are actually hardened tears  that when we don't allow men to have their girl self and have their vulnerability  and have their compassion  and have their hearts  that they become hardened and hurtful and violent. And I think we have taught men to be secure when they are insecure  to pretend they know things when they don't know things  or why would we be where we are  To pretend they're not a mess when they are a mess. And I will tell you a very funny story. On my way here on the airplane  I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane. And all these men  literally at least    men  were in their little seats watching chick flicks. And they were all alone  and I thought   This is the secret life of men.  I've traveled  as I said  to many  many countries  and I've seen  if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it's horrific to think what we do to girls in the world. And we heard from Sunitha yesterday  and Kavita about what we do to girls. But I just want to say that I've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns  who are literally being treated like ashtrays. I've seen girls be treated like garbage cans. I've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and uncles. I've seen girls starving themselves to death in America in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves. I've seen that we cut girls and we control them and we keep them illiterate  or we make them feel bad about being too smart. We silence them. We make them feel guilty for being smart. We get them to behave  to tone it down  not to be too intense. We sell them  we kill them as embryos  we enslave them  we rape them. We are so accustomed to robbing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we have now actually objectified them and turned them into commodities. The selling of girls is rampant across the planet. And in many places they are worth less than goats and cows. But I also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of    to     they are they key  really  in the developing world  as well as in the whole world  to the future of humanity. And if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages that keep them where society wants them to be  including lack of access to healthcare  education  healthy foods  labor force participation. The burden of all the household tasks usually falls on girls and younger siblings  which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers. The state of girls  the condition of girls  will  in my belief    and that's the girl inside us and the girl in the world    determine whether the species survives. And what I want to suggest is that  having talked to girls  because I just finished a new book called  I Am an Emotional Creature  The Secret Life of Girls Around the World   I've been talking to girls for five years  and one of the things that I've seen is true everywhere is that the verb that's been enforced on girl is the verb  to please.  Girls are trained to please. I want to change the verb. I want us all to change the verb. I want the verb to be  educate   or  activate   or  engage   or  confront   or  defy   or  create.  If we teach girls to change the verb we will actually enforce the girl inside us and the girl inside them. And I have to now share a few stories of girls I've seen across the planet who have engaged their girl  who have taken on their girl in spite of all the circumstances around them. I know a    year old girl in the Netherlands  for example  who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself. There is a teenage girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed    stars tattooed on the right side of her face. There is a girl  Julia Butterfly Hill  who lived for a year in a tree because she wanted to protect the wild oaks. There is a girl who I met    years ago in Afghanistan who I have adopted as my daughter because her mother was killed. Her mother was a revolutionary. And this girl  when she was    years old  wore a burqa in Afghanistan  and went into the stadiums and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women  underneath her burqa  with a video. And that video became the video that went out all over the world after      to show what was going on in Afghanistan. I want to talk about Rachel Corrie who was in her teens when she stood in front of an Israeli tank to say   End the occupation.  And she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank. And I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently in Bukavu  who was impregnated by her rapist. And she was holding her baby. And I asked her if she loved her baby. And she looked into her baby's eyes and she said   Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby  It's my baby and it's full of love.  The capacity for girls to overcome situations and to move on levels  to me  is mind blowing. There is a girl named Dorcas  and I just met her in Kenya. Dorcas is    years old  and she was trained in self defense. A few months ago she was picked up on the street by three older men. They kidnapped her  they put her in a car. And through her self defense  she grabbed their Adam's apples  she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car. In Kenya  in August  I went to visit one of the V Day safe houses for girls  a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio. Agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl  she was female genitally mutilated. And she made a decision as many women do across this planet  that what was done to her would not be enforced and done to other women and girls. So  for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley. She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like  and what a mutilated vagina looked like. And in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her we asked her what we could do for her  and she said   Well  if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster.  So  we got her a Jeep. And then she saved       girls. And then we asked her   Okay  what else do you need   And she said   Well  now  I need a house.  So  seven years ago Agnes built the first V Day safe house in Narok  Kenya  in the Masai land. And it was a house where girls could run away  they could save their clitoris  they wouldn't be cut  they could go to school. And in the years that Agnes has had the house  she has changed the situation there. She has literally become deputy mayor. She's changed the rules. The whole community has bought in to what she's doing. When we were there she was doing a ritual where she reconciles girls  who have run away  with their families. And there was a young girl named Jaclyn. Jaclyn was    years old and she was in her Masai family and there's a drought in Kenya. So cows are dying  and cows are the most valued possession. And Jaclyn overheard her father talking to an old man about how he was about to sell her for the cows. And she knew that meant she would be cut. She knew that meant she wouldn't go to school. She knew that meant she wouldn't have a future. She knew she would have to marry that old man  and she was   . So  one afternoon  she'd heard about the safe house  Jaclyn left her father's house and she walked for two days  two days through Masai land. She slept with the hyenas. She hid at night. She imagined her father killing her on one hand  and Mama Agnes greeting her  with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house. And when she got to the house she was greeted. Agnes took her in  and Agnes loved her  and Agnes supported her for the year. She went to school and she found her voice  and she found her identity  and she found her heart. Then  her time was ready when she had to go back to talk to her father about the reconciliation  after a year. I had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled. In that hut  we walked in  and her father and his four wives were sitting there  and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled  and her primary mother  who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders. When her father saw her and saw who she had become  in her full girl self  he threw his arms around her and broke down crying. He said   You are beautiful. You have grown into a gorgeous woman. We will not cut you. And I give you my word  here and now  that we will not cut your sisters either.  And what she said to him was   You were willing to sell me for four cows  and a calf and some blankets. But I promise you  now that I will be educated I will always take care of you  and I will come back and I will build you a house. And I will be in your corner for the rest of your life.  For me  that is the power of girls. And that is the power of transformation. I want to close today with a new piece from my book. And I want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here. And I want to do it for Sunitha. And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday  the girls who survive  the girls who can become somebody else. But I really want to do it for each and every person here  to value the girl in us  to value the part that cries  to value the part that's emotional  to value the part that's vulnerable  to understand that's where the future lies. This is called  I'm An Emotional Creature.  And it happened because I met a girl in Watts  L.A. I was asking girls if they like being a girl  and all the girls were like   No  I hate it. I can't stand it. It's all bad. My brothers get everything.  And this girl just sat up and went   I love being a girl. I'm an emotional creature   This is for her  I love being a girl. I can feel what you're feeling as you're feeling inside the feeling before. I am an emotional creature. Things do not come to me as intellectual theories or hard pressed ideas. They pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears. Oh  I know when your girlfriend's really pissed off  even though she appears to give you what you want. I know when a storm is coming. I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air. I can tell you he won't call back. It's a vibe I share. I am an emotional creature. I love that I do not take things lightly. Everything is intense to me  the way I walk in the street  the way my momma wakes me up  the way it's unbearable when I lose  the way I hear bad news. I am an emotional creature. I am connected to everything and everyone. I was born like that. Don't you say all negative that it's only only a teenage thing  or it's only because I'm a girl. These feelings make me better. They make me present. They make me ready. They make me strong. I am an emotional creature. There is a particular way of knowing. It's like the older women somehow forgot. I rejoice that it's still in my body. Oh  I know when the coconut's about to fall. I know we have pushed the Earth too far. I know my father isn't coming back  and that no one's prepared for the fire. I know that lipstick means more than show  and boys are super insecure  and so called terrorists are made  not born. I know that one kiss could take away all my decision making ability. And you know what  Sometimes it should. This is not extreme. It's a girl thing  what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open. Don't tell me not to cry  to calm it down  not to be so extreme  to be reasonable. I am an emotional creature. It's how the earth got made  how the wind continues to pollinate. You don't tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave. I am an emotional creature. Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off  I am your remaining memory. I can take you back. Nothing's been diluted. Nothing's leaked out. I love  hear me  I love that I can feel the feelings inside you  even if they stop my life  even if they break my heart  even if they take me off track  they make me responsible. I am an emotional  I am an emotional  incondotional  devotional creature. And I love  hear me  I love  love  love being a girl. Can you say it with me  I love  I love  love  love being a girl  Thank you very much. Please close your eyes  and open your hands. Now imagine what you could place in your hands  an apple  maybe your wallet. Now open your eyes. What about a life  What you see here is a premature baby. He looks like he's resting peacefully  but in fact he's struggling to stay alive because he can't regulate his own body temperature. This baby is so tiny he doesn't have enough fat on his body to stay warm. Sadly     million babies like this are born every year around the world. Four million of these babies die annually. But the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive grow up with severe  long term health problems. The reason is because in the first month of a baby's life  its only job is to grow. If it's battling hypothermia  its organs can't develop normally  resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes  to heart disease  to low I.Q. Imagine  Many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm. That is the primary function of an incubator. But traditional incubators require electricity and cost up to    thousand dollars. So  you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries. As a result  parents resort to local solutions like tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies  or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here    methods that are both ineffective and unsafe. I've seen this firsthand over and over again. On one of my first trips to India  I met this young woman  Sevitha  who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby  Rani. She took her baby to the nearest village clinic  and the doctor advised her to take Rani to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator. But that hospital was over four hours away  and Sevitha didn't have the means to get there  so her baby died. Inspired by this story  and dozens of other similar stories like this  my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution  something that could work without electricity  that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use  given that the majority of births still take place in the home. We needed something that was portable  something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies and something ultra low cost  compared to the        dollars that an incubator in the U.S. costs. So  this is what we came up with. What you see here looks nothing like an incubator. It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby. You can open it up completely. It's waterproof. There's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily. But the magic is in this pouch of wax. This is a phase change material. It's a wax like substance with a melting point of human body temperature     degrees Celsius. You can melt this simply using hot water and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time  after which you simply reheat the pouch. So  you then place it into this little pocket back here  and it creates a warm micro environment for the baby. Looks simple  but we've reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors  moms and clinicians to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities. We plan to launch this product in India in       and the target price point will be    dollars  less than  .  percent of the cost of a traditional incubator. Over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies. But the longer term social impact is a reduction in population growth. This seems counterintuitive  but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced  population sizes also decrease  because parents don't need to anticipate that their babies are going to die. We hope that the Embrace infant warmer and other simple innovations like this represent a new trend for the future of technology  simple  localized  affordable solutions that have the potential to make huge social impact. In designing this we followed a few basic principles. We really tried to understand the end user  in this case  people like Sevitha. We tried to understand the root of the problem rather than being biased by what already exists. And then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem. In doing this  I believe we can truly bring technology to the masses. And we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace. So  imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says   Excuse me  what is the name of this block   And you say   I'm sorry  well  this is Oak Street  that's Elm Street. This is   th  that's   th.  He says   OK  but what is the name of that block   You say   Well  blocks don't have names. Streets have names  blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets.  He leaves  a little confused and disappointed. So  now imagine you're standing on a street  anywhere in Japan  you turn to a person next to you and say   Excuse me  what is the name of this street   They say   Oh  well that's Block    and this is Block   .  And you say   OK  but what is the name of this street   And they say   Well  streets don't have names. Blocks have names. Just look at Google Maps here. There's Block                       . All of these blocks have names  and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks. And you say then   OK  then how do you know your home address   He said   Well  easy  this is District Eight. There's Block     house number one.  You say   OK  but walking around the neighborhood  I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order.  He says   Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built. The first house ever built on a block is house number one. The second house ever built is house number two. Third is house number three. It's easy. It's obvious.  So  I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn't even know we had  and realize that the opposite of them may also be true. So  for example  there are doctors in China who believe that it's their job to keep you healthy. So  any month you are healthy you pay them  and when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failed at their job. They get rich when you're healthy  not sick. In most music  we think of the  one  as the downbeat  the beginning of the musical phrase  one  two  three  four. But in West African music  the  one  is thought of as the end of the phrase  like the period at the end of a sentence. So  you can hear it not just in the phrasing  but the way they count off their music  two  three  four  one. And this map is also accurate. There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India  the opposite is also true. So  let's never forget  whether at TED  or anywhere else  that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear  that the opposite may also be true. Domo arigato gozaimashita. As a researcher  every once in a while you encounter something a little disconcerting. And this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you  and teaches you that you're very wrong about something that you really believed firmly in. And these are unfortunate moments  because you go to sleep that night dumber than when you woke up. So  that's really the goal of my talk  is to A  communicate that moment to you and B  have you leave this session a little dumber than when you entered. So  I hope I can really accomplish that. So  this incident that I'm going to describe really began with some diarrhea. Now  we've known for a long time the cause of diarrhea. That's why there's a glass of water up there. For us  it's a problem  the people in this room. For babies  it's deadly. They lack nutrients  and diarrhea dehydrates them. And so  as a result  there is a lot of death  a lot of death. In India in       there was a    percent child mortality rate  lots of people didn't make it. This is incredibly unfortunate. One of the big reasons this happened was because of diarrhea. Now  there was a big effort to solve this problem  and there was actually a big solution. This solution has been called  by some   potentially the most important medical advance this century.  Now  the solution turned out to be simple. And what it was was oral rehydration salts. Many of you have probably used this. It's brilliant. It's a way to get sodium and glucose together so that when you add it to water the child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea. Remarkable impact on mortality. Massive solution to the problem. Flash forward           percent child mortality has dropped to  .  percent today. Still a big number  but a big drop. It looks like the technological problem is solved. But if you look  even today there are about         diarrhea related deaths in India alone. What's going on here  Well the easy answer is  we just haven't gotten those salts to those people. That's actually not true. If you look in areas where these salts are completely available  the price is low or zero  these deaths still continue abated. Maybe there's a biological answer. Maybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration alone doesn't solve. That's not true either. Many of these deaths were completely preventable  and this what I want to think of as the disconcerting thing  what I want to call  the last mile  problem. See  we spent a lot of energy  in many domains    technological  scientific  hard work  creativity  human ingenuity    to crack important social problems with technology solutions. That's been the discoveries of the last       years  that's mankind moving forward. But in this case we cracked it  but a big part of the problem still remains. Nine hundred and ninety nine miles went well  the last mile's proving incredibly stubborn. Now  that's for oral rehydration therapy. Maybe this is something unique about diarrhea. Well  it turns out    and this is where things get really disconcerting    it's not unique to diarrhea. It's not even unique to poor people in India. Here's an example from a variety of contexts. I've put a bunch of examples up here. I'll start with insulin  diabetes medication in the U.S. OK  the American population. On Medicaid    if you're fairly poor you get Medicaid  or if you have health insurance    insulin is pretty straightforward. You get it  either in pill form or you get it as an injection  you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels. Massive technological advance  took an incredibly deadly disease  made it solvable. Adherence rates. How many people are taking their insulin every day  About on average  a typical person is taking it    percent of the time. As a result         people a year go blind  hundreds of thousands lose limbs  every year  for something that's solvable. Here I have a bunch of other examples  all suffer from the last mile problem. It's not just medicine. Here's another example from technology  agriculture. We think there's a food problem  so we create new seeds. We think there's an income problem  so we create new ways of farming that increase income. Well  look at some old ways  some ways that we'd already cracked. Intercropping. Intercropping really increases income. Sometimes in rice we found incredible increases in yield when you mix different varieties of rice side by side. Some people are doing that  many are not. What's going on  This is the last mile. The last mile is  everywhere  problematic. Alright  what's the problem  The problem is this little three pound machine that's behind your eyes and between your ears. This machine is really strange  and one of the consequences is that people are weird. They do lots of inconsistent things. They do lots of inconsistent things. And the inconsistencies create  fundamentally  this last mile problem. See  when we were dealing with our biology  bacteria  the genes  the things inside here  the blood  That's complex  but it's manageable. When we're dealing with people like this  The mind is more complex. That's not as manageable  and that's what we're struggling with. Let me go back to diarrhea for a second. Here's a question that was asked in the National Sample Survey  which is a survey asked of many Indian women   Your child has diarrhea. Should you increase  maintain or decrease the number of fluids   Just so you don't embarrass yourselves  I'll give you the right answer  It's increase. Now  diarrhea's interesting because it's been around for thousands of years  ever since humankind really lived side by side enough to have really polluted water. One Roman strategy that was very interesting was that    and it really gave them a comparative advantage    they made sure their soldiers didn't drink even remotely muddied waters. Because if some of your troops get diarrhea they're not that effective on the battlefield. So  if you think of Roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields  the breastplates  but part of it was drinking the right water. So  here are these women. They've seen their parents have struggled with diarrhea  they've struggled with diarrhea  they've seen lots of deaths. How do they answer this question  In India     to    percent say  Reduce.  Think about what that means for a second. Thirty five to    percent of women forget oral rehydration therapy  they are increasing    they are actually making their child more likely to die through their actions. How is that possible  Well  one possibility    I think that's how most people respond to this    is to say   That's just stupid.  I don't think that's stupid. I think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing. And that is  you don't put water into a leaky bucket. So  think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake. Just doesn't make sense. Now  the model is intuitively right. It just doesn't happen to be right about the world. But it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level. And that  to me  is the fundamental challenge of the last mile. This first challenge is what I refer to as the persuasion challenge. Convincing people to do something    take oral rehydration therapy  intercrop  whatever it might be    is not an act of information   Let's give them the data  and when they have data they'll do the right thing.  It's more complex than that. And if you want to understand how it's more complex let me start with something kind of interesting. I'm going to give you a little math problem  and I want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible. A bat and a ball together cost   .  . The bat costs a dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost  Quick. So  somebody out there says   Five.  A lot of you said   Ten.  Let's think about    for a second. If the ball costs     the bat costs... this is easy    .  . Yeah. So  together they would cost   .  . So  here you all are  ostensibly educated people. Most of you look smart. The combination of that produces something that is actually  you got this thing wrong. How is that possible  Let's go to something else. I know algebra can be complicated. So  let's dial this back. That's what  Fifth grade  Fourth grade  Let's go back to kindergarten. OK  There's a great show on American television that you have to watch. It's called  Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader   I think we've learned the answer to that here. Let's move to kindergarten. Let's see if we can beat five year olds. Here's what I'm going to do  I'm going to put objects on the screen. I just want you to name the color of the object. That's all it is. OK  I want you to do it fast  and say it out loud with me  and do it quickly. I'll make the first one easy for you. Ready  Black. Now the next ones I want you to do quickly and say it out loud. Ready  Go. Audience  Red. Green. Yellow. Blue. Red. Sendhil Mullainathan  That's pretty good. Almost out of kindergarten. What is all this telling us  You see  what's going on here  and in the bat and ball problem is that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world  some models that you use to understand the world. These models  like the leaky bucket  work well in most situations. I suspect most of you    I hope that's true for the rest of you    actually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world. I found a problem  a specific problem that actually found an error with that. Diarrhea  and many last mile problems  are like that. They are situations where the mental model doesn't match the reality. Same thing here  You had an intuitive response to this that was very quick. You read  blue  and you wanted to say  blue   even though you knew your task was red. Now  I do this stuff because it's fun. But it's more profound than fun. I'll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion. BMW is a pretty safe car. And they are trying to figure out   Safety is good. I want to advertise safety. How am I going to advertise safety    I could give people numbers. We do well on crash tests.  But the truth of the matter is  you look at that car  it doesn't look like a Volvo  and it doesn't look like a Hummer. So  what I want you to think about for a few minutes is  How would you convey safety of the BMW  Okay  So now  while you're thinking about that let's move to a second task. The second task is fuel efficiency. Okay  Here's another puzzle for all of you. One person walks into a car lot  and they're thinking about buying this Toyota Yaris. They are saying   This is    miles per gallon. I'm going to do the environmentally right thing  I'm going to buy the Prius     miles per gallon.  Another person walks into the lot  and they're about to buy a Hummer  nine miles per gallon  fully loaded  luxury. And they say   You know what  Do I need turbo  Do I need this heavyweight car   I'm going to do something good for the environment. I'm going to take off some of that weight  and I'm going to buy a Hummer that's    miles per gallon.  Which one of these people has done more for the environment  See  you have a mental model. Fifty versus     that's a big move. Eleven versus nine  Come on. Turns out  go home and do the math  the nine to    is a bigger change. That person has saved more gallons. Why  Because we don't care about miles per gallon  we care about gallons per mile. Think about how powerful that is if you're trying to encourage fuel efficiency. Miles per gallon is the way we present things. If we want to encourage change of behavior  gallons per mile would have far more effectiveness. Researchers have found these type of anomalies. Okay  back to BMW. What should they do  The problem BMW faces is this car looks safe. This car  which is my Mini  doesn't look that safe. Here was BMW's brilliant insight  which they embodied into an ad campaign. They showed a BMW driving down the street. There's a truck on the right. Boxes fall out of the truck. The car swerves to avoid it  and therefore doesn't get into an accident. BWM realizes safety  in people's minds  has two components. You can be safe because when you're hit  you survive  or you can be safe because you avoid accidents. Remarkably successful campaign  but notice the power of it. It harnesses something you already believe. Now  even if I persuaded you to do something  it's hard sometimes to actually get action as a result. You all probably intended to wake up  I don't know          a.m. This is a battle we all fight every day  along with trying to get to the gym. Now  this is an example of that battle  and makes us realize intentions don't always translate into action  and so one of the fundamental challenges is how we would actually do that. OK  So  let me now talk about the last mile problem. So far  I've been pretty negative. I've been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior. And I think maybe I'm being too negative. Maybe it's the diarrhea. Maybe the last mile problem really should be thought of as the last mile opportunity. Let's go back to diabetes. This is a typical insulin injection. Now  carrying this thing around is complicated. You gotta carry the bottle  you gotta carry the syringe. It's also painful. Now  you may think to yourself   Well  if my eyes depended on it  you know  I would obviously use it every day.  But the pain  the discomfort  you know  paying attention  remembering to put it in your purse when you go on a long trip  These are the day to day of life  and they do pose problems. Here is an innovation  a design innovation. This is a pen  it's called an insulin pen  preloaded. The needle is particularly sharp. You just gotta carry this thing around. It's much easier to use  much less painful. Anywhere between five and    percent increase in adherence  just as a result of this. That's what I'm talking about as a last mile opportunity. You see  we tend to think the problem is solved when we solve the technology problem. But the human innovation  the human problem still remains  and that's a great frontier that we have left. This isn't about the biology of people  this is now about the brains  the psychology of people  and innovation needs to continue all the way through the last mile. Here's another example of this. This is from a company called Positive Energy. This is about energy efficiency. We're spending a lot of time on fuel cells right now. What this company does is they send a letter to households that say   Here's your energy use  here's your neighbor's energy use  You're doing well.  Smiley face.  You're doing worse.  Frown. And what they find is just this letter  nothing else  has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use. And you want to think about the social value of that in terms of carbon offsets  reduced electricity      million dollars per year. Why  Because for free  this isn't a new technology  this is a letter    we're getting a Big Bang in behavior. So  how do we tackle the last mile  I think this tells us there is an opportunity. And I think to tackle it  we need to combine psychology  marketing  art  we've seen that. But you know what we need to combine it with  We need to combine this with the scientific method. See what's really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile  to me  is that the first     miles are all about science. No one would say   Hey  I think this medicine works  go ahead and use it.  We have testing  we go to the lab  we try it again  we have refinement. But you know what we do on the last mile   Oh  this is a good idea. People will like this. Let's put it out there.  The amount of resources we put in are disparate. We put billions of dollars into fuel efficient technologies. How much are we putting into energy behavior change in a credible  systematic  testing way  Now  I think that we're on the verge of something big. We're on the verge of a whole new social science. It's a social science that recognizes    much like science recognizes the complexity of the body  biology recognizes the complexity of the body    we'll recognize the complexity of the human mind. The careful testing  retesting  design  are going to open up vistas of understanding  complexities  difficult things. And those vistas will both create new science  and fundamental change in the world as we see it  in the next hundred years. All right. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Sendhil  thank you so much. So  this whole area is so fascinating. I mean  it sometimes feels  listening to behavioral economists that they are kind of putting into place academically  what great marketers have sort of intuitively known for a long time. How much is your field talking to great marketers about their insights into human psychology  Because they've seen it on the ground. Sendhil Mullainathan  Yeah  we spend a lot of time talking to marketers  and I think    percent of it is exactly what you say  there are insights to be gleaned there. Forty percent of it is about what marketing is. Marketing is selling an ad to a firm. So  in some sense  a lot of marketing is about convincing a CEO   This is a good ad campaign.  So  there is a little bit of slippage there. That's just a caveat. That's different from actually having an effective ad campaign. And one of the new movements in marketing is  How do we actually measure effectiveness  Are we effective  CA  How you take your insights here and actually get them integrated into working business models on the ground  in Indian villages  for example  SM  So  the scientific method I alluded to is pretty important. We work closely with companies that have operational capacity  or nonprofits that have operational capacity. And then we say   Well  you want to get this behavior change. Let's come up with a few ideas  test them  see which is working  go back  synthesize  and try to come up with a thing that works   and then we're able to scale with partners. It's kind of the model that has worked in other contexts. If you have biological problems we try and fix it  see if it works  and then work the scale. CA  Alright Sendhil  thanks so much for coming to TED. Thank you. When my brother called me in December of       he said   The news does not look good.  This is him on the screen. He'd just been diagnosed with ALS  which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years. It paralyzes you. It starts by killing the motor neurons in your spinal cord. And you go from being a healthy  robust    year old male to someone that cannot breathe  cannot move  cannot speak. This has actually been  to me  a gift  because we began a journey to learn a new way of thinking about life. And even though Steven passed away three years ago we had an amazing journey as a family. We did not even    I think adversity is not even the right word. We looked at this and we said   We're going to do something with this in an incredibly positive way.  And I want to talk today about one of the things that we decided to do  which was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare. Because  as we all know here today  it doesn't work very well. I want to talk about it in the context of a story. This is the story of my brother. But it's just a story. And I want to go beyond the story  and go to something more.  Given my status  what is the best outcome I can hope to achieve  and how do I get there   is what we are here to do in medicine  is what everyone should do. And those questions all have variables to them. All of our statuses are different. All of our hopes and dreams  what we want to accomplish  is different  and our paths will be different  they are all stories. But it's a story until we convert it to data and so what we do  this concept we had  was to take Steven's status   What is my status   and go from this concept of walking  breathing  and then his hands  speak  and ultimately happiness and function. So  the first set of pathologies  they end up in the stick man on his icon  but the rest of them are really what's important here. Because Steven  despite the fact that he was paralyzed  as he was in that pool  he could not walk  he could not use his arms    that's why he had the little floaty things on them  did you see those     he was happy. We were at the beach  he was raising his son  and he was productive. And we took this  and we converted it into data. But it's not a data point at that one moment in time. It is a data point of Steven in a context. Here he is in the pool. But here he is healthy  as a builder  taller  stronger  got all the women  amazing guy. Here he is walking down the aisle  but he can barely walk now  so it's impaired. And he could still hold his wife's hand  but he couldn't do buttons on his clothes  can't feed himself. And here he is  paralyzed completely  unable to breathe and move  over this time journey. These stories of his life  converted to data. He renovated my carriage house when he was completely paralyzed  and unable to speak  and unable to breathe  and he won an award for a historic restoration. So  here's Steven alone  sharing this story in the world. And this is the insight  the thing that we are excited about  because we have gone away from the community that we are  the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other. We need to give to others to be successful. So  Steven is sharing this story  but he is not alone. There are so many other people sharing their stories. Not stories in words  but stories in data and words. And we convert that information into this structure  this understanding  this ability to convert those stories into something that is computable  to which we can begin to change the way medicine is done and delivered. We did this for ALS. We can do this for depression  Parkinson's disease  HIV. These are not simple  they are not internet scalable  they require thought and processes to find the meaningful information about the disease. So  this is what it looks like when you go to the website. And I'm going to show you what Patients Like Me  the company that myself  my youngest brother and a good friend from MIT started. Here are the actual patients  there are        of them now  sharing their stories as data. Here is an M.S. patient. His name is Mike  and he is uniformly impaired on cognition  vision  walking  sensation. Those are things that are different for each M.S. patient. Each of them can have a different characteristic. You can see fibromyalgia  HIV  ALS  depression. Look at this HIV patient down here  Zinny. It's two years of this disease. All of the symptoms are not there. But he is working to keep his CD  count high and his viral level low so he can make his life better. But you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments. Look at this        people almost  on Copaxone. These are patients currently on drugs  sharing data. I love some of these  physical exercise  prayer. Anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study on prayer against something  Let's look at prayer. What I love about this  just sort of interesting design problems. These are why people pray. Here is the schedule of how frequently they    it's a dose. So  anyone want to see the    patients that pray for    minutes a day  and see if they're doing better  they probably are. Here they are. It's an open network  everybody is sharing. We can see it all. Or  I want to look at anxiety  because people are praying for anxiety. And here is data on        people's current anxiety  right now. How they treat it  the drugs  the components of it  their side effects  all of it in a rich environment  and you can drill down and see the individuals. This amazing data allows us to drill down and see what this drug is for          people on this drug  I think. Yes. I want to talk to the    patients down here who are taking four milligrams a day. And I want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing it for more than two years. So  you can see the duration. All open  all available. I'm going to log in. And this is my brother's profile. And this is a new version of our platform we're launching right now. This is the second generation. It's going to be in Flash. And you can see here  as this animates over  Steven's actual data against the background of all other patients  against this information. The blue band is the   th percentile. Steven is the   th percentile  that he has non genetic ALS. You scroll down in this profile and you can see all of his prescription drugs  but more than that  in the new version  I can look at this interactively. Wait  poor spinal capacity. Doesn't this remind you of a great stock program  Wouldn't it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves was as good as the technology we use to make money  Detrol. In the side effects for his drug  integrated into that  the stem cell transplant that he had  the first in the world  shared openly for anyone who wants to see it. I love here    the cyberkinetics implant  which was  again  the only patient's data that was online and available. You can adjust the time scale. You can adjust the symptoms. You can look at the interaction between how I treat my ALS. So  you click down on the ALS tab there. I'm taking three drugs to manage it. Some of them are experimental. I can look at my constipation  how to manage it. I can see magnesium citrate  and the side effects from that drug all integrated in the time in which they're meaningful. But I want more. I don't want to just look at this cool device  I want to take this data and make something even better. I want my brother's center of the universe and his symptoms and his drugs  and all of the things that interact among those  the side effects  to be in this beautiful data galaxy that we can look at in any way we want to understand it  so that we can take this information and go beyond just this simple model of what a record is. I don't even know what a medical record is. I want to solve a problem. I want an application. So  can I take this data    rearrange yourself  put the symptoms in the left  the drugs across the top  tell me everything we know about Steven and everyone else  and what interacts. Years after he's had these drugs  I learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva  including some positive side effects that came from other drugs  were making his constipation worse. And if anyone's ever had severe constipation  and you don't understand how much of an impact that has on your life    yes  that was a pun. You're trying to manage these  and this grid is available here  and we want to understand it. No one's ever had this kind of information. So  patients have this. We're for patients. This is all about patient health care  there was no doctors on our network. This is about the patients. So  how can we take this and bring them a tool that they can go back and they can engage the medical system  And we worked hard  and we thought about it and we said   What's something we can use all the time  that we can use in the medical care system  that everyone will understand   So  the patients print it out  because hospitals usually block us because they believe we are a social network. It's actually the most used feature on the website. Doctors actually love this sheet  and they're actually really engaged. So  we went from this story of Steven and his history to data  and then back to paper  where we went back and engaged the medical care system. And here's another paper. This is a journal  PNAS    I think it's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America. You've seen multiple of these today  when everyone's bragging about the amazing things they've done. This is a report about a drug called lithium. Lithium  that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder  that a group in Italy found slowed ALS down in    patients  and published it. Now  we'll skip the critiques of the paper. But the short story is  If you're a patient  you want to be on the blue line. You don't want to be on the red line  you want to be on the blue line. Because the blue line is a better line. The red line is way downhill  the blue line is a good line. So  you know we said    we looked at this  and what I love also is that people always accuse these Internet sites of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly. So  this is what happened when PNAS published this. Ten percent of the people in our system took lithium. Ten percent of the patients started taking lithium based on    patients of data in a bad publication. And they call the Internet irresponsible. Here's the implication of what happens. There's this one guy  named Humberto  from Brazil  who unfortunately passed away nine months ago  who said   Hey  listen. Can you help us answer this question  Because I don't want to wait for the next trial  it's going to be years. I want to know now. Can you help us   So  we launched some tools  we let them track their blood levels. We let them share the data and exchange it. You know  a data network. And they said  you know   Jamie  PLM  can you guys tell us whether this works or not   And we went around and we talked to people  and they said   You can't run a clinical trial like this. You know  You don't have the blinding  you don't have data  it doesn't follow the scientific method. It's never going to work. You can't do it.  So  I said   Okay well we can't do that. Then we can do something harder.  I can't say whether lithium works in all ALS patients  but I can say whether it works in Humberto. I bought a Mac about two years ago  I converted over  and I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine that came in Leopard. And we said    because it's really cool  you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer  and find everything you've lost  and I loved it. And I said   What if we built a time machine for patients  except instead of going backwards  we go forwards. Can we find out what's going to happen to you  so that you can maybe change it   So  we did. We took all the patients like Humberto  That's the Apple background  we stole that because we didn't have time to build our own. This is a real app by the way. This is not just graphics. And you take those data  and we find the patients like him  and we bring their data together. And we bring their histories into it. And then we say   Well how do we line them all up   So  we line them all up so they go together around the meaningful points  integrated across everything we know about the patient. Full information  the entire course of their disease. And that's what is going to happen to Humberto  unless he does something. And he took lithium  and he went down the line. And it works almost every time. Now  the ones that it doesn't work are interesting. But almost all the time it works. It's actually scary. It's beautiful. So  we couldn't run a clinical trial  we couldn't figure it out. But we could see whether it was going to work for Humberto. And yeah  all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power and all the standard deviation. We'll do that later. But here is the answer of the mean of the patients that actually decided to take lithium. These are all the patients that started lithium. It's the Intent to Treat Curve. You can see here  the blue dots on the top  the light ones  those are the people in the study in PNAS that you wanted to be on. And the red ones are the ones  the pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn't want to be. And the ones in the middle are all of our patients from the start of lithium at time zero  going forward  and then going backward. So  you can see we matched them perfectly  perfectly. Terrifyingly accurate matching. And going forward  you actually don't want to be a lithium patient this time. You're actually doing slightly worse    not significantly  but slightly worse. You don't want to be a lithium patient this time. But you know  a lot of people dropped out  the trial  there is too much drop out. Can we do the even harder thing  Can we go to the patients that actually decided to stay on lithium  because they were so convinced they were getting better  We asked our control algorithm  are those    patients    by the way  you'll notice that's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial    can we look at those patients and say   Can we match them with our time machine to the other patients that are just like them  and what happens   Even the ones that believed they were getting better matched the controls exactly. Exactly. Those little lines  That's the power. So  we    I can't tell you lithium doesn't work. I can't tell you that if you did it at a higher dose or if you run the study proper    I can tell you that for those    people that took lithium  they didn't do any better than the people that were just like them  just like me  and that we had the power to detect that at about a quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study. We did that one year ahead of the time when the first clinical trial funded by the NIH for millions of dollars failed for futility last week  and announced it. So  remember I told you about my brother's stem cell transplant. I never really knew whether it worked. And I put     million cells in his cisterna magna  in his lumbar cord  and filled out the IRBs and did all this work  and I never really knew. How did I not know  I mean  I didn't know what was going to happen to him. I actually asked Tim  who is the quant in our group    we actually searched for about a year to find someone who could do the sort of math and statistics and modeling in healthcare  couldn't find anybody. So  we went to the finance industry. And there are these guys who used to model the future of interest rates  and all that kind of stuff. And some of them were available. So  we hired one. We hired them  set them up  assisting at lab. I I.M. him things. That's the way I communicate with him  is like a little guy in a box. I I.M.ed Tim. I said   Tim can you tell me whether my brother's stem cell transplant worked or not   And he sent me this two days ago. It was that little outliers there. You see that guy that lived a long time  We have to go talk to him. Because I'd like to know what happened. Because something went different. But my brother didn't. My brother went straight down the line. It only works about    months. It's the first version of the time machine. First time we ever tried it. We'll try to get it better later but    months so far. And  you know  I look at this  and I get really emotional. You look at the patients  you can drill in all the controls  you can look at them  you can ask them. And I found a woman that had    we found her  she was odd because she had data after she died. And her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores  because he knew how much she cared. And I am thankful. I can't believe that these people  years after my brother had died  helped me answer the question about whether an operation I did  and spent millions of dollars on years ago  worked or not. I wished it had been there when I'd done it the first time  and I'm really excited that it's here now  because the lab that I founded has some data on a drug that might work  and I'd like to show it. I'd like to show it in real time  now  and I want to do that for all of the diseases that we can do that for. I've got to thank the        people that are doing this social experiment with us. There is an amazing journey we are going on to become human again  to be part of community again  to share of ourselves  to be vulnerable  and it's very exciting. So  thank you. The problem that I want to talk with you about is really the problem of  How does one supply healthcare in a world in which cost is everything  How do you do that  And the basic paradigm we want to suggest to you  I want to suggest to you  is one in which you say that in order to treat disease you have to first know what you're treating    that's diagnostics    and then you have to do something. So  the program that we're involved in is something which we call Diagnostics for All  or zero cost diagnostics. How do you provide medically relevant information at as close as possible to zero cost  How do you do it  Let me just give you two examples. The rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world    poor resources  a rigorous environment  a series of problems in lightweight  and things of this kind    and also not so different from the home healthcare and diagnostic system world. So  the technology that I want to talk about is for the third world  for the developing world  but it has  I think  much broader application  because information is so important in the healthcare system. So  you see two examples here. One is a lab that is actually a fairly high end laboratory in Africa. The second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing who knows what in a table in a market. I don't know what kind of healthcare is delivered there. But it's not really what is probably most efficient. What is our approach  And the way in which one typically approaches a problem of lowering cost  starting from the perspective of the United States  is to take our solution  and then to try to cut cost out of it. No matter how you do that  you're not going to start with a         dollar instrument and bring it down to no cost. It isn't going to work. So  the approach that we took was the other way around. To ask   What is the cheapest possible stuff that you could make a diagnostic system out of  and get useful information  add function   And what we've chosen is paper. What you see here is a prototypic device. It's about a centimeter on the side. It's about the size of a fingernail. The lines around the edges are a polymer. It's made of paper and paper  of course  wicks fluid  as you know  paper  cloth    drop wine on the tablecloth  and the wine wicks all over everything. Put it on your shirt  it ruins the shirt. That's what a hydrophilic surface does. So  in this device the idea is that you drip the bottom end of it in a drop of  in this case  urine. The fluid wicks its way into those chambers at the top. The brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine  the blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine. And the combination of those two is a first order shot at a number of useful things that you want. So  this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper. Now  how simple can you make the production  Why do we choose paper  There's an example of the same thing on a finger  showing you basically what it looks like. One reason for using paper is that it's everywhere. We have made these kinds of devices using napkins and toilet paper and wraps  and all kinds of stuff. So  the production capability is there. The second is  you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place. I'll show you in a moment that the stack of paper there would probably hold something like         tests  something of that kind. And then finally  a point that you don't think of so much in developed world medicine  it eliminates sharps. And what sharps means is needles  things that stick. If you've taken a sample of someone's blood and the someone might have hepatitis C  you don't want to make a mistake and stick it in you. It just    you don't want to do that. So  how do you dispose of that  It's a problem everywhere. And here you simply burn it. So  it's a sort of a practical approach to starting on things. Now  you say   If paper is a good idea  other people have surely thought of it.  And the answer is  of course  yes. Those half of you  roughly  who are women  at some point may have had a pregnancy test. And the most common of these is in a device that looks like the thing on the left. It's something called a lateral flow immunoassay. In that particular test  urine either  containing a hormone called HCG  does or does not flow across a piece of paper. And there are two bars. One bar indicates that the test is working  and if the second bar shows up  you're pregnant. This is a terrific kind of test in a binary world  and the nice thing about pregnancy is either you are pregnant or you're not pregnant. You're not partially pregnant or thinking about being pregnant or something of that sort. So  it works very well there  but it doesn't work very well when you need more quantitative information. There are also dipsticks  but if you look at the dipsticks  they're for another kind of urine analysis. There are an awful lot of colors and things like that. What do you actually do about that in a difficult circumstance  So  the approach that we started with is to ask  Is it really practical to make things of this sort  And that problem is now  in a purely engineering way  solved. And the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper. You run it through a new kind of printer called a wax printer. The wax printer does what looks like printing. It is printing. You put that on  you warm it a little bit  the wax prints through so it absorbs into the paper  and you end up with the device that you want. The printers cost     bucks now. They'll make  we estimate that if you were to run them    hours a day they'd make about    million tests a year. So  it's a solved problem  that particular problem is solved. And there is an example of the kind of thing that you see. That's on a piece of   by    paper. That takes about two seconds to make. And so I regard that as done. There is a very important issue here  which is that because it's a printer  a color printer  it prints colors. That's what color printers do. I'll show you in a moment  that's actually quite useful. Now  the next question that you would like to ask is  What would you like to measure  What would you like to analyze  And the thing which you'd most like to analyze  we're a fair distance from. It's what's called  fever of undiagnosed origin.  Someone comes into the clinic  they have a fever  they feel bad. What do they have  Do they have T.B.  Do they have AIDS  Do they have a common cold  The triage problem. That's a hard problem for reasons that I won't go through. There are an awful lot of things that you'd like to distinguish among. But then there are a series of things  AIDS  hepatitis  malaria  TB  others and simpler ones  such as guidance of treatment. Now even that's more complicated than you think. A friend of mine works in transcultural psychiatry  and he is interested in the question of why people do and don't take their meds. So  Dapsone  or something like that  you have to take it for a while. He has a wonderful story of talking to a villager in India and saying   Have you taken your Dapsone    Yes.   Have you taken it every day    Yes.   Have you taken if for a month    Yes.  What the guy actually meant was that he'd fed a    day dose of Dapsone to his dog  that morning. He was telling the truth. Because in a different culture  the dog is a surrogate for you  you know   today    this month    since the rainy season     there are lots of opportunities for misunderstanding  and so an issue here is to  in some cases  to figure out how to deal with matters that seem uninteresting  like compliance. Now  take a look at what a typical test looks like. Prick a finger  you get some blood  about    microliters. That's about all you're going to get  because you can't use the usual sort of systems. You can't manipulate it very well  although I'll show something about that in a moment. So  you take the drop of blood  no further manipulations  you put it on a little device  the device filters out the blood cells  lets the serum go through  and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there. And the colors indicate  disease  or  normal.  But even that's complicated  because to you  to me  colors might indicate  normal   but  after all  we're all suffering from probably an excess of education. What you do about something which requires quantitative analysis  And so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there  and at this point there is a dramatic flourish  and out comes the universal solution to everything these days  which is a cell phone. In this particular case  a camera phone. They're everywhere  six billion a month in India. And the idea is that what one does  is to take the device  you dip it  you develop the color  you take a picture  the picture goes to a central laboratory. You don't have to send out a doctor  you send out somebody who can just take the sample  and in the clinic either a doctor  or ideally a computer in this case  does the analysis. Turns out to work actually quite well  particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work. So  my view of the health care worker of the future is not a doctor  but is an    year old  otherwise unemployed  who has two things  He has a backpack full of these tests  and a lancet to occasionally take a blood sample  and an AK   . And these are the things that get him through his day. There's another very interesting connection here  and that is that what one wants to do is to pass through useful information over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system. It turns out there's an enormous amount of information already available on that subject  which is the Mars rover problem. How do you get back an accurate view of the color on Mars if you have a really terrible bandwidth to do it with  And the answer is not complicated but it's one which I don't want to go through here  other than to say that the communication systems for doing this are really pretty well understood. Also  a fact which you may not know is that the compute capability of this thing is not so different from the compute capability of your desktop computer. This is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped. I don't know whether the idea of one computer  one child makes any sense. Here's the computer of the future  because this screen is already there and they're ubiquitous. All right now let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices. And we'll start by posing a little problem. What you see here is another centimeter sized device  and the different colors are different colors of dye. And you notice something which might strike you as a little bit interesting  which is the yellow seems to disappear  get through the blue  and then get through the red. How does that happen  How do you make something flow through something  And  of course the answer is   You don't.  You make it flow under and over. But now the question is  How do you make it flow under and over in a piece of paper  The answer is that what you do  and the details are not terribly important here  is to make something more elaborate  You take several different layers of paper  each one containing its own little fluid system  and you separate them by pieces of  literally  double sided carpet tape  the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor. And the fluid will flow from one layer into the next. It distributes itself  flows through further holes  distributes itself. And what you see  at the lower right hand side there  is a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top  and it has gone through and distributed itself into these    holes on the bottom  in a piece of paper    basically it looks like a chip  two pieces of paper thick. And in this particular case we were just interested in the replicability of that. But that is  in principle  the way you solve the  fever of unexplained origin  problem  because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease  and this will work in due course. Here is an example of a slightly more complicated device. There's the chip. You dip in a corner. The fluid goes into the center. It distributes itself out into these various wells or holes  and turns color  and all done with paper and carpet tape. So  I think it's as low cost as we're likely to be able to come up and make things. Now  I have one last  two last little stories to tell you  in finishing off this business. This is one  One of the things that one does occasionally need to do is to separate blood cells from serum. And the question was  here we do it by taking a sample  we put it in a centrifuge  we spin it  and you get blood cells out. Terrific. What happens if you don't have an electricity  and a centrifuge  and whatever  And we thought for a while of how you might do this and the way  in fact  you do it is what's shown here. You get an eggbeater  which is everywhere  and you saw off a blade  and then you take tubing  and you stick it on that. You put the blood in  you spin it    somebody sits there and spins it. It works really  really well. And we sat down  we did the physics of eggbeaters and self aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing  sent it off to a journal. We were very proud of this  particularly the title  which was  Eggbeater as Centrifuge.  And we sent it off  and by return mail it came back. I called up the editor and I said   What's going on  How is this possible   The editor said  with enormous disdain   I read this. And we're not going to publish it  because we only publish science.  And it's an important issue because it means that we have to  as a society  think about what we value. And if it's just papers and phys. rev. letters  we've got a problem. Here is another example of something which is    this is a little spectrophotometer. It measures the absorption of light in a sample The neat thing about this is  you have light source that flickers on and off at about       hertz  another light source that detects that light at       hertz  and so you can run this system in broad daylight. It performs about equivalently to a system that's in the order of         dollars. It costs    dollars. We can probably make it for    cents  if we put our mind to it. Why doesn't somebody do it  And the answer is   How do you make a profit in a capitalist system  doing that   Interesting problem. So  let me finish by saying that we've thought about this as a kind of engineering problem. And we've asked  What is the scientific unifying idea here  And we've decided that we should think about this not so much in terms of cost  but in terms of simplicity. Simplicity is a neat word. And you've got to think about what simplicity means. I know what it is but I don't actually know what it means. So  I actually was interested enough in this to put together several groups of people. And the most recent involved a couple of people at MIT  one of them being an exceptionally bright kid who is one of the very few people I would think of who's an authentic genius. We all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity. And I want to give you the answer of this deep scientific thought. So  in a sense  you get what you pay for. Thank you very much. I'm a cancer doctor  and I walked out of my office and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago  and this was the cover of Fortune magazine sitting in the window of the pharmacy. And so  as a cancer doctor  you look at this  and you get a little bit downhearted. But when you start to read the article by Cliff  who himself is a cancer survivor  who was saved by a clinical trial where his parents drove him from New York City to upstate New York to get an experimental therapy for    at the time    Hodgkin's disease  which saved his life  he makes remarkable points here. And the point of the article was that we have gotten reductionist in our view of biology  in our view of cancer. For the last    years  we have focused on treating the individual gene in understanding cancer  not in controlling cancer. So  this is an astounding table. And this is something that sobers us in our field everyday in that  obviously  we've made remarkable impacts on cardiovascular disease  but look at cancer. The death rate in cancer in over    years hasn't changed. We've made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia  where we have a pill that can put     percent of people in remission  but in general  we haven't made an impact at all in the war on cancer. So  what I'm going to tell you today  is a little bit of why I think that's the case  and then go out of my comfort zone and tell you where I think it's going  where a new approach    that we hope to push forward in terms of treating cancer. Because this is wrong. So  what is cancer  first of all  Well  if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value  you go to a doctor  they stick a needle in. They way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern recognition  Does it look normal  Does it look abnormal  So  that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle. This is a normal cell. This is a cancer cell. That is the state of the art today in diagnosing cancer. There's no molecular test  there's no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday  there's no fancy looking at the chromosomes. This is the state of the art and how we do it. You know  I know very well  as a cancer doctor  I can't treat advanced cancer. So  as an aside  I firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early. It is the only way you can start to fight cancer  is by catching it early. We can prevent most cancers. You know  the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease. We could do the same in cancer. I co founded a company called Navigenics  where  if you spit into a tube    and we can look look at    or    genetic markers for disease  all of which are delayable in many of the cancers    you start to identify what you could get  and then we can start to work to prevent them. Because the problem is  when you have advanced cancer  we can't do that much today about it  as the statistics allude to. So  the thing about cancer is that it's a disease of the aged. Why is it a disease of the aged  Because evolution doesn't care about us after we've had our children. See  evolution protected us during our childbearing years and then  after age    or    or     it said  It doesn't matter anymore  because they've had their progeny.  So if you look at cancers  it is very rare    extremely rare    to have cancer in a child  on the order of thousands of cases a year. As one gets older  Very  very common. Why is it hard to treat  Because it's heterogeneous  and that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer. It starts to select out for those bad  aggressive cells  what we call clonal selection. But  if we start to understand that cancer isn't just a molecular defect  it's something more  then we'll get to new ways of treating it  as I'll show you. So  one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer is that  right now  we describe it by a number of adjectives  symptoms   I'm tired  I'm bloated  I have pain  etc.  You then have some anatomic descriptions  you get that CT scan   There's a three centimeter mass in the liver.  You then have some body part descriptions   It's in the liver  in the breast  in the prostate.  And that's about it. So  our dictionary for describing cancer is very  very poor. It's basically symptoms. It's manifestations of a disease. What's exciting is that over the last two or three years  the government has spent     million dollars  and they've allocated another billion dollars  to what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project. So  it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer  and giving us a new lexicon  a new dictionary to describe it. You know  in the mid     's in France  they started to describe cancer by body part. That hasn't changed in over     years. It is absolutely archaic that we call cancer by prostate  by breast  by muscle. It makes no sense  if you think about it. So  obviously  the technology is here today  and  over the next several years  that will change. You will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic. You will go to a HER  amplified clinic  or an EGFR activated clinic  and they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions that were involved in causing this individual cancer. So  hopefully  we will go from being the art of medicine more to the science of medicine  and be able to do what they do in infectious disease  which is look at that organism  that bacteria  and then say   This antibiotic makes sense  because you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it.  When one is exposed to H N   you take Tamiflu  and you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms and prevent many of the manifestations of the disease. Why  Because we know what you have  and we know how to treat it    although we can't make vaccine in this country  but that's a different story. The Cancer Genome Atlas is coming out now. The first cancer was done  which was brain cancer. In the next month  the end of December  you'll see ovarian cancer  and then lung cancer will come several months after. There's also a field of proteomics that I'll talk about in a few minutes  which I think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease. But remember  I'm not pushing genomics  proteomics  to be a reductionist. I'm doing it so we can identify what we're up against. And there's a very important distinction there that we'll get to. In health care today  we spend most of the dollars    in terms of treating disease    most of the dollars in the last two years of a person's life. We spend very little  if any  dollars in terms of identifying what we're up against. If you could start to move that  to identify what you're up against  you're going to do things a hell of a lot better. If we could even take it one step further and prevent disease  we can take it enormously the other direction  and obviously  that's where we need to go  going forward. So  this is the website of the National Cancer Institute. And I'm here to tell you  it's wrong. So  the website of the National Cancer Institute says that cancer is a genetic disease. The website says   If you look  there's an individual mutation  and maybe a second  and maybe a third  and that is cancer.  But  as a cancer doc  this is what I see. This isn't a genetic disease. So  there you see  it's a liver with colon cancer in it  and you see into the microscope a lymph node where cancer has invaded. You see a CT scan where cancer is in the liver. Cancer is an interaction of a cell that no longer is under growth control with the environment. It's not in the abstract  it's the interaction with the environment. It's what we call a system. The goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer. And I think that's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades  is that we have strived to understand cancer. The goal is to control cancer. And that is a very different optimization scheme  a very different strategy for all of us. I got up at the American Association of Cancer Research  one of the big cancer research meetings  with        people there  and I said   We've made a mistake. We've all made a mistake  myself included  by focusing down  by being a reductionist. We need to take a step back.  And  believe it or not  there were hisses in the audience. People got upset  but this is the only way we're going to go forward. You know  I was very fortunate to meet Danny Hillis a few years ago. We were pushed together  and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other. I said   Do I really want to meet a guy from Disney  who designed computers   And he was saying  Does he really want to meet another doctor  But people prevailed on us  and we got together  and it's been transformative in what I do  absolutely transformative. We have designed  and we have worked on the modeling    and much of these ideas came from Danny and from his team    the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system. And I'll show you some data there where I really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it. The key is  when you look at these variables and you look at this data  you have to understand the data inputs. You know  if I measured your temperature over    days  and I asked   What was the average temperature   and it came back at   .   I would say   Great.  But if during one of those days your temperature spiked to     for six hours  and you took Tylenol and got better  etc.  I would totally miss it. So  one of the problems  the fundamental problems in medicine is that you and I  and all of us  we go to our doctor once a year. We have discrete data elements  we don't have a time function on them. Earlier it was referred to this direct life device. You know  I've been using it for two and a half months. It's a staggering device  not because it tells me how many kilocalories I do every day  but because it looks  over    hours  what I've done in a day. And I didn't realize that for three hours I'm sitting at my desk  and I'm not moving at all. And a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here are really different than we understand them  because we're not measuring them dynamically. And so  if you think of cancer as a system  there's an input and an output and a state in the middle. So  the states  are equivalent classes of history  and the cancer patient  the input  is the environment  the diet  the treatment  the genetic mutations. The output are our symptoms  Do we have pain  Is the cancer growing  Do we feel bloated  etc.  Most of that state is hidden. So what we do in our field is we change and input  we give aggressive chemotherapy  and we say   Did that output get better  Did that pain improve  etc.   And so  the problem is that it's not just one system  it's multiple systems on multiple scales. It's a system of systems. And so  when you start to look at emergent systems  you can look at a neuron under a microscope. A neuron under the microscope is very elegant with little things sticking out and little things over here  but when you start to put them together in a complex system  and you start to see that it becomes a brain  and that brain can create intelligence  what we're talking about in the body  and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system. Well  the bad news is that these robust    and robust is a key word    emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail. The good news is you can manipulate them. You can try to control them without that fundamental understanding of every component. One of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer came out in February in the New England Journal of Medicine  where they took women who were pre menopausal with breast cancer. So  about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get. They had gotten their chemotherapy  and then they randomized them  where half got placebo  and half got a drug called Zoledronic acid that builds bone. It's used to treat osteoporosis  and they got that twice a year. They looked and  in these       women  given twice a year a drug that builds bone  you reduce the recurrence of cancer by    percent. Reduce occurrence of cancer by a drug that doesn't even touch the cancer. So the notion  you change the soil  the seed doesn't grow as well. You change that system  and you could have a marked effect on the cancer. Nobody has ever shown    and this will be shocking    nobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy actually touches a cancer cell. It's never been shown. There's all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes  that if you give this cancer drug  you can do this effect to the cell  but the doses in those dishes are nowhere near the doses that happen in the body. If I give a woman with breast cancer a drug called Taxol every three weeks  which is the standard  about    percent of women with metastatic cancer have a great response to that drug. And a response is    percent shrinkage. Well  remember that's not even an order of magnitude  but that's a different story. They then recur  I give them that same drug every week. Another    percent will respond. They then recur  I give them that same drug over    hours by continuous infusion  another    or    percent will respond. So  you can't tell me it's working by the same mechanism in all three size. It's not. We have no idea the mechanism. So the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting that complex system  just like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence  chemotherapy may work by that same exact way. The wild thing about that trial also  was that it reduced new primaries  so new cancers  by    percent also. So  the problem is  yours and mine  all of our systems are changing. They're dynamic. I mean  this is a scary slide  not to take an aside  but it looks at obesity in the world. And I'm sorry if you can't read the numbers  they're kind of small. But  if you start to look at it  that red  that dark color there  more than    percent of the population of those countries are obese. Look a decade ago  look two decades ago  markedly different. So  our systems today are dramatically different than our systems a decade or two ago. So the diseases we have today  which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades  are going to change dramatically over the next decade or so based on things like this. So  this picture  although it is beautiful  is a    gigabyte picture of the whole proteome. So this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet  and we're able to get resolution where we can start to see all of the proteins in the body. We can start to see that system. Each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified. The power of these magnets  the power of what we can do here  is that we can see an individual neutron with this technology. So  again  this is stuff we're doing with Danny Hillis and a group called Applied Proteomics  where we can start to see individual neutron differences  and we can start to look at that system like we never have before. So  instead of a reductionist view  we're taking a step back. So this is a woman     years old  who had recurrent lung cancer. It was in her brain  in her lungs  in her liver. She had gotten Carboplatin Taxol  Carboplatin Taxotere  Gemcitabine  Navelbine  Every drug we have she had gotten  and that disease continued to grow. She had three kids under the age of     and this is her CT scan. And so what this is  is we're taking a cross section of her body here  and you can see in the middle there is her heart  and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor that will invade and will kill her  untreated  in a matter of weeks. She goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway  and again  I'm not sure if this pathway was in the system  in the cancer  but it targeted a pathway  and a month later  pow  that cancer's gone. Six months later it's still gone. That cancer recurred  and she passed away three years later from lung cancer  but she got three years from a drug whose symptoms predominately were acne. That's about it. So  the problem is that the clinical trial was done  and we were a part of it  and in the fundamental clinical trial    the pivotal clinical trial we call the Phase Three  we refused to use a placebo. Would you want your mother  your brother  your sister to get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live  And the answer  obviously  is not. So  it was done on this group of patients. Ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here  and the drug went to the FDA  and the FDA said   Without a placebo  how do I know patients actually benefited from the drug   So the morning the FDA was going to meet  this was the editorial in the Wall Street Journal. And so  what do you know  that drug was approved. The amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial  where they gave half placebo and half the drug. And we learned something important there. What's interesting is they did it in South America and Canada  where it's  more ethical to give placebos.  They had to give it also in the U.S. to get approval  so I think there were three U.S. patients in upstate New York who were part of the trial. But they did that  and what they found is that    percent of the non responders lived much longer and did better than people who got placebo. So it challenged everything we knew in cancer  is that you don't need to get a response. You don't need to shrink the disease. If we slow the disease  we may have more of a benefit on patient survival  patient outcome  how they feel  than if we shrink the disease. The problem is that  if I'm this doc  and I get your CT scan today and you've got a two centimeter mass in your liver  and you come back to me in three months and it's three centimeters  did that drug help you or not  How do I know  Would it have been    centimeters  or am I giving you a drug with no benefit and significant cost  So  it's a fundamental problem. And  again  that's where these new technologies can come in. And so  the goal obviously is that you go into your doctor's office    well  the ultimate goal is that you prevent disease  right  The ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening. That is the most effective  cost effective  best way we can do things today. But if one is unfortunate to get a disease  you'll go into your doctor's office  he or she will take a drop of blood  and we will start to know how to treat your disease. The way we've approached it is the field of proteomics  again  this looking at the system. It's taking a big picture. The problem with technologies like this is that if one looks at proteins in the body  there are    orders of magnitude difference between the high abundant and the low abundant proteins. So  there's no technology in the world that can span    orders of magnitude. And so  a lot of what has been done with people like Danny Hillis and others is to try to bring in engineering principles  try to bring the software. We can start to look at different components along this spectrum. And so  earlier was talked about cross discipline  about collaboration. And I think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now is that people from those fields are coming in. Yesterday  the National Cancer Institute announced a new program called the Physical Sciences and Oncology  where physicists  mathematicians  are brought in to think about cancer  people who never approached it before. Danny and I got    million dollars  they announced yesterday  to try to attach this problem. A whole new approach  instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy by different mechanisms  to try to bring technology to get a picture of what's actually happening in the body. So  just for two seconds  how these technologies work    because I think it's important to understand it. What happens is every protein in your body is charged  so the proteins are sprayed in  the magnet spins them around  and then there's a detector at the end. When it hit that detector is dependent on the mass and the charge. And so we can accurately    if the magnet is big enough  and your resolution is high enough    you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body and start to get an understanding of the individual system. And so  as a cancer doctor  instead of having paper in my chart  in your chart  and it being this thick  this is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices  where that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data. Electronic data elements are describing every aspect of the disease. And certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter and actually move forward  instead of just having encounter and encounter  without fundamental learning. So  to conclude  we need to get away from reductionist thinking. We need to start to think differently and radically. And so  I implore everyone here  Think differently. Come up with new ideas. Tell them to me or anyone else in our field  because over the last    years  nothing has changed. We need a radically different approach. You know  Andy Grove stepped down as chairman of the board at Intel    and Andy was one of my mentors  tough individual. When Andy stepped down  he said   No technology will win. Technology itself will win.  And I'm a firm believer  in the field of medicine and especially cancer  that it's going to be a broad platform of technologies that will help us move forward and hopefully help patients in the near term. Thank you very much. John Hockenberry  It's great to be here with you  Tom. And I want to start with a question that has just been consuming me since I first became familiar with your work. In you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality of a natural force in some sort of interplay with creative force. Are they ever in equilibrium in the way that you see your work  Tom Shannon  Yeah  the subject matter that I'm looking for  it's usually to solve a question. I had the question popped into my head  What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like if you could connect the two spheres  And in proportion  what would the size of the sphere and the length  and what would the taper be to the Earth  And so I went about and made that sculpture  turning it out of solid bronze. And I did one that was about    feet long. The sun end was about four inches in diameter  and then it tapered over about    feet to about a millimeter at the Earth end. And so for me  it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context  as though you were an astronaut  and see these two things as an object  because they are so intimately bound  and one is meaningless without the other. JH  Is there a relief in playing with these forces  And I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces. TS  Well  like the magnetically levitated objects    like that silver one there  that was the result of hundreds of experiments with magnets  trying to find a way to make something float with the least possible connection to the ground. So I got it down to just one tether to be able to support that. JH  Now is this electromagnetic here  or are these static  TS  Those are permanent magnets  yeah. JH  Because if the power went out  there would just be a big noise. TS  Yeah. It's really unsatisfactory having plug in art. JH  I agree. TS  The magnetic works are a combination of gravity and magnetism  so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything. The sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the planets and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun. So there's this huge invisible shape structures that magnetism takes in the universe. But with the pendulum  it allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets up. My sculptures are normally very simplified. I try to refine them down to very simple forms. But the paintings become very complex  because I think the fields that are supporting them  they're billowing  and they're interpenetrating  and they're interference patterns. JH  And they're non deterministic. I mean  you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin  even though the forces can be calculated. So the evolution of this    I gather this isn't your first pendulum. TS  No.  JH  No.  TS  The first one I did was in the late   's  and I just had a simple cone with a spigot at the bottom of it. I threw it into an orbit  and it only had one color  and when it got to the center  the paint kept running out  so I had to run in there  didn't have any control over the spigot remotely. So that told me right away  I need a remote control device. But then I started dreaming of having six colors. I sort of think about it as the DNA    these colors  the red  blue  yellow  the primary colors and white and black. And if you put them together in different combinations    just like printing in a sense  like how a magazine color is printed    and put them under certain forces  which is orbiting them or passing them back and forth or drawing with them  these amazing things started appearing. JH  It looks like we're loaded for bear here. TS  Yeah  well let's put a couple of canvases. I'll ask a couple of my sons to set up the canvases here. I want to just say    so this is Jack  Nick and Louie. JH  Thanks guys. TS  So here are the    JH  All right  I'll get out of the way here. TS  I'm just going to throw this into an orbit and see if I can paint everybody's shoes in the front. JH  Whoa. That is ... ooh  nice. TS  So something like this. I'm doing this as a demo  and it's more playful  but inevitably  all of this can be used. I can redeem this painting  just continuing on  doing layers upon layers. And I keep it around for a couple of weeks  and I'm contemplating it  and I'll do another session with it and bring it up to another level  where all of this becomes the background  the depth of it. JH  That's fantastic. So the valves at the bottom of those tubes there are like radio controlled airplane valves. TS  Yes  they're servos with cams that pinch these rubber tubes. And they can pinch them very tight and stop it  or you can have them wide open. And all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom. You can always be changing colors  put aluminum paint  or I could put anything into this. It could be tomato sauce  or anything could be dispensed    sand  powders or anything like that. JH  So many forces there. You've got gravity  you've got the centrifugal force  you've got the fluid dynamics. Each of these beautiful paintings  are they images in and of themselves  or are they records of a physical event called the pendulum approaching the canvas  TS  Well  this painting here  I wanted to do something very simple  a simple  iconic image of two ripples interfering. So the one on the right was done first  and then the one on the left was done over it. And then I left gaps so you could see the one that was done before. And then when I did the second one  it really disturbed the piece    these big blue lines crashing through the center of it    and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap. There are lines in front of the one on the right  and there are lines behind the one on the left  and so it takes it into different planes. What it's also about  just the little events  the events of the interpenetration of    JH  Two stars  or    TS  Two things that happened    there's an interference pattern  and then a third thing happens. There are shapes that come about just by the marriage of two events that are happening  and I'm very interested in that. Like the occurrence of moire patterns. Like this green one  this is a painting I did about    years ago  but it has some    see  in the upper third    there are these moires and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery. And that's something that in painting I've never seen done. I've never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns  which are so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives. JH  Is that a literal part of the image  or is my eye making that interference pattern    is my eye completing that interference pattern  TS  It is the paint actually  makes it real. It's really manifested there. If I throw a very concentric circle  or concentric ellipse  it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines  which get closer and closer together  which describes how gravity works. There's something very appealing about the exactitude of science that I really enjoy. And I love the shapes that I see in scientific observations and apparatus  especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it  the scale  is very interesting to me. My focus in recent years has kind of shifted more toward biology. Some of these paintings  when you look at them very close  odd things appear that really look like horses or birds or crocodiles  elephants. There are lots of things that appear. When you look into it  it's sort of like looking at cloud patterns  but sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered. And then there are all these forms that we don't know what they are  but they're equally well resolved and complex. So I think  conceivably  those could be predictive. Because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we're familiar with in biology  it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with. And maybe it's the kind of forms we'll discover underneath the surface of Mars  where there are probably lakes with fish swimming under the surface. JH  Oh  let's hope so. Oh  my God  let's. Oh  please  yes. Oh  I'm so there. You know  it seems at this stage in your life  you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant    I suppose it's an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your Parkinson's and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life. Is that relevant to your work  TS  As it turns out  this device kind of comes in handy  because I don't have to have the fine motor skills to do  that I can operate slides  which is more of a mental process. I'm looking at it and making decisions  It needs more red  it needs more blue  it needs a different shape. And so I make these creative decisions and can execute them in a much  much simpler way. I mean  I've got the symptoms. I guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years  but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms. In my case  my left hand has a significant tremor and my left leg also. I'm left handed  and so I draw. All my creations really start on small drawings  which I have thousands of  and it's my way of just thinking. I draw with a simple pencil  and at first  the Parkinson's was really upsetting  because I couldn't get the pencil to stand still. JH  So you're not a gatekeeper for these forces. You don't think of yourself as the master of these forces. You think of yourself as the servant. TS  Nature is    well  it's a godsend. It just has so much in it. And I think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature  humans are of the universe. The universe is in our mind  and our minds are in the universe. And we are expressions of the universe  basically. As humans  ultimately being part of the universe  we're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe. And to interface with it  with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do  giving them pigment and paint just like an artist  it's a good ally. It's a terrific studio assistant. JH  Well  I love the idea that somewhere within this idea of fine motion and control with the traditional skills that you have with your hand  some sort of more elemental force gets revealed  and that's the beauty here. Tom  thank you so much. It's been really  really great. TS  Thank you  John. I am going to speak about corruption  but I would like to juxtapose two different things. One is the large global economy  the large globalized economy  and the other one is the small  and very limited  capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to govern  to shape  this economy. Because there is this asymmetry  which creates  basically  failing governance. Failing governance in many areas  in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment  in the area of exploitation of women and children  in the area of climate change  in all the areas in which we really need a capacity to reintroduce the primacy of politics into the economy  which is operating in a worldwide arena. And I think corruption  and the fight against corruption  and the impact of corruption  is probably one of the most interesting ways to illustrate what I mean with this failure of governance. Let me talk about my own experience. I used to work as the director of the World Bank office in Nairobi for East Africa. At that time  I noticed that corruption  that grand corruption  that systematic corruption  was undermining everything we were trying to do. And therefore  I began to not only try to protect the work of the World Bank  our own projects  our own programs against corruption  but in general  I thought   We need a system to protect the people in this part of the world from the ravages of corruption.  And as soon as I started this work  I received a memorandum from the World Bank  from the legal department first  in which they said   You are not allowed to do this. You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries. This is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank  so I want you to stop your doings.  In the meantime  I was chairing donor meetings  for instance  in which the various donors  and many of them like to be in Nairobi    it is true  it is one of the unsafest cities of the world  but they like to be there because the other cities are even less comfortable. And in these donor meetings  I noticed that many of the worst projects    which were put forward by our clients  by the governments  by promoters  many of them representing suppliers from the North    that the worst projects were realized first. Let me give you an example  a huge power project      million dollars  to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable  and one of the most beautiful  areas of western Kenya. And we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits  It had no clients  nobody would buy the electricity there  nobody was interested in irrigation projects. To the contrary  we knew that this project would destroy the environment  It would destroy riparian forests  which were the basis for the survival of nomadic groups  the Samburu and the Turkana in this area. So everybody knew this is a  not a useless project  this is an absolute damaging  a terrible project    not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars  and the siphoning off of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools  like hospitals and so on. And yet  we all rejected this project  none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it  and it was the first project to be implemented. The good projects  which we as a donor community would take under our wings  they took years  you know  you had too many studies  and very often they didn't succeed. But these bad projects  which were absolutely damaging    for the economy for many generations  for the environment  for thousands of families who had to be resettled    they were suddenly put together by consortia of banks  of supplier agencies  of insurance agencies    like in Germany  Hermes  and so on    and they came back very  very quickly  driven by an unholy alliance between the powerful elites in the countries there and the suppliers from the North. Now  these suppliers were our big companies. They were the actors of this global market  which I mentioned in the beginning. They were the Siemenses of this world  coming from France  from the UK  from Japan  from Canada  from Germany  and they were systematically driven by systematic  large scale corruption. We are not talking about        dollars here  or         dollars there  or one million dollars there. No  we are talking about    million     million dollars on the Swiss bank accounts  on the bank accounts of Liechtenstein  of the president's ministers  the high officials in the para statal sectors. This was the reality which I saw  and not only one project like that  I saw  I would say  over the years I worked in Africa  I saw hundreds of projects like this. And so  I became convinced that it is this systematic corruption which is perverting economic policy making in these countries  which is the main reason for the misery  for the poverty  for the conflicts  for the violence  for the desperation in many of these countries. That we have today more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line  that we have more than a billion people without proper drinking water in the world  twice that number  more than two billion people without sanitation and so on  and the consequent illnesses of mothers and children  still  child mortality of more than    million people every year  children dying before they are five years old  The cause of this is  to a large extent  grand corruption. Now  why did the World Bank not let me do this work  I found out afterwards  after I left  under a big fight  the World Bank. The reason was that the members of the World Bank thought that foreign bribery was okay  including Germany. In Germany  foreign bribery was allowed. It was even tax deductible. No wonder that most of the most important international operators in Germany  but also in France and the UK and Scandinavia  everywhere  systematically bribed. Not all of them  but most of them. And this is the phenomenon which I call failing governance  because when I then came to Germany and started this little NGO here in Berlin  at the Villa Borsig  we were told   You cannot stop our German exporters from bribing  because we will lose our contracts. We will lose to the French  we will lose to the Swedes  we'll lose to the Japanese.  And therefore  there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma  which made it very difficult for an individual company  an individual exporting country to say   We are not going to continue this deadly  disastrous habit of large companies to bribe.  So this is what I mean with a failing governance structure  because even the powerful government  which we have in Germany  comparatively  was not able to say   We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad.  They needed help  and the large companies themselves have this dilemma. Many of them didn't want to bribe. Many of the German companies  for instance  believe that they are really producing a high quality product at a good price  so they are very competitive. They are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors are  but they were not allowed to show their strengths  because the world was eaten up by grand corruption. And this is why I'm telling you this  Civil society rose to the occasion. We had this small NGO  Transparency International. They began to think of an escape route from this prisoner's dilemma  and we developed concepts of collective action  basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table  explaining to all of them how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop bribing  and to make a long story short  we managed to eventually get Germany to sign together with the other OECD countries and a few other exporters. In       a convention  under the auspices of the OECD  which obliged everybody to change their laws and criminalize foreign bribery. Well  thank you. I mean  it's interesting  in doing this  we had to sit together with the companies. We had here in Berlin  at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee  we had sessions with about    captains of industry  and we discussed with them what to do about international bribery. In the first session    we had three sessions over the course of two years. And President von Weizs cker  by the way  chaired one of the sessions  the first one  to take the fear away from the entrepreneurs  who were not used to deal with non governmental organizations. And in the first session  they all said   This is not bribery  what we are doing.  This is customary there. This is what these other cultures demand. They even applaud it. In fact   unclear  still says this today. And so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing. But in the second session  they admitted already that they would never do this  what they are doing in these other countries  here in Germany  or in the U.K.  and so on. Cabinet ministers would admit this. And in the final session  at the Aspen Institute  we had them all sign an open letter to the Kohl government  at the time  requesting that they participate in the OECD convention. And this is  in my opinion  an example of soft power  because we were able to convince them that they had to go with us. We had a longer term time perspective. We had a broader  geographically much wider  constituency we were trying to defend. And that's why the law has changed. That's why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in and that's why MIN is in the trouble they are in. In some other countries  the OECD convention is not yet properly enforced. And  again  civil societies breathing down the neck of the establishment. In London  for instance  where the BAE got away with a huge corruption case  which the Serious Fraud Office tried to prosecute      million British pounds  every year for ten years  to one particular official of one particular friendly country  who then bought for    billion pounds of military equipment. This case  they are not prosecuting in the UK. Why  Because they consider this as contrary to the security interest of the people of Great Britain. Civil society is pushing  civil society is trying to get a solution to this problem  also in the U.K.  and also in Japan  which is not properly enforcing  and so on. In Germany  we are pushing the ratification of the UN convention  which is a subsequent convention. We are  Germany  is not ratifying. Why  Because it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of deputies. In Germany  we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant  but you are allowed to bribe a deputy. This is  under German law  allowed  and the members of our parliament don't want to change this  and this is why they can't sign the U.N. convention against foreign bribery    one of they very  very few countries which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world  but not able to ratify the convention  which we managed to get on the books with about     countries all over the world. I see my time is ticking. Let me just try to draw some conclusions from what has happened. I believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting corruption  one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance. By now  the United Nations is totally on our side. The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus  under Wolfensohn  they became  I would say  the strongest anti corruption agency in the world. Most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against bribery and so on. And this is possible because civil society joined the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem  in the development of remedies  in the implementation of reforms  and then later  in the monitoring of reforms. Of course  if civil society organizations want to play that role  they have to grow into this responsibility. Not all civil society organizations are good. The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO. So  we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself. They have to have a much more transparent financial governance. They have to have a much more participatory governance in many civil society organizations. We also need much more competence of civil society leaders. This is why we have set up the governance school and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin  because we believe most of our educational and research institutions in Germany and continental Europe in general  do not focus enough  yet  on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society. But what I'm saying from my very practical experience  If civil society does it right and joins the other actors    in particular  governments  governments and their international institutions  but also large international actors  in particular those which have committed themselves to corporate social responsibility    then in this magical triangle between civil society  government and private sector  there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better world. Thank you. Sadly  in the next    minutes when I do our chat  four Americans that are alive will be dead through the food that they eat. My name's Jamie Oliver. I'm    years old. I'm from Essex in England and for the last seven years I've worked fairly tirelessly to save lives in my own way. I'm not a doctor  I'm a chef  I don't have expensive equipment or medicine. I use information  education. I profoundly believe that the power of food has a primal place in our homes that binds us to the best bits of life. We have an awful  awful reality right now. America  you're at the top of your game. This is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world. Can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have children in this room today  Put your hands up. You can continue to put your hands up  aunties and uncles as well. Most of you. OK. We  the adults of the last four generations  have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan than their own parents. Your child will live a life ten years younger than you because of the landscape of food that we've built around them. Two thirds of this room  today  in America  are statistically overweight or obese. You lot  you're all right  but we'll get you eventually  don't worry. The statistics of bad health are clear  very clear. We spend our lives being paranoid about death  murder  homicide  you name it  it's on the front page of every paper  CNN. Look at homicide at the bottom  for God's sake. Right  Every single one of those in the red is a diet related disease. Any doctor  any specialist will tell you that. Fact  diet related disease is the biggest killer in the United States  right now  here today. This is a global problem. It's a catastrophe. It's sweeping the world. England is right behind you  as usual. I know they were close  but not that close. We need a revolution. Mexico  Australia  Germany  India  China  all have massive problems of obesity and bad health. Think about smoking. It costs way less than obesity now. Obesity costs you Americans    percent of your health care bills      billion dollars a year. In    years  it's set to double      billion dollars a year. Let's be honest  guys  you haven't got that cash. I came here to start a food revolution that I so profoundly believe in. We need it. The time is now. We're in a tipping point moment. I've been doing this for seven years. I've been trying in America for seven years. Now is the time when it's ripe    ripe for the picking. I went to the eye of the storm. I went to West Virginia  the most unhealthy state in America. Or it was last year. We've got a new one this year  but we'll work on that next season. Huntington  West Virginia. Beautiful town. I wanted to put heart and soul and people  your public  around the statistics that we've become so used to. I want to introduce you to some of the people that I care about  your public  your children. I want to show a picture of my friend Brittany. She's    years old. She's got six years to live because of the food that she's eaten. She's the third generation of Americans that hasn't grown up within a food environment where they've been taught to cook at home or in school  or her mom  or her mom's mom. She has six years to live. She's eating her liver to death. Stacy  the Edwards family. This is a normal family  guys. Stacy does her best  but she's third generation as well  she was never taught to cook at home or at school. The family's obese. Justin here     years old  he's     pounds. He gets bullied  for God's sake. The daughter there  Katie  she's four years old. She's obese before she even gets to primary school. Marissa  she's all right  she's one of your lot. But you know what  Her father  who was obese  died in her arms  And then the second most important man in her life  her uncle  died of obesity  and now her step dad is obese. You see  the thing is  obesity and diet related disease doesn't just hurt the people that have it  it's all of their friends  families  brothers  sisters. Pastor Steve  an inspirational man  one of my early allies in Huntington  West Virginia. He's at the sharp knife edge of this problem. He has to bury the people  OK  And he's fed up with it. He's fed up with burying his friends  his family  his community. Come winter  three times as many people die. He's sick of it. This is preventable disease. Waste of life. By the way  this is what they get buried in. We're not geared up to do this. Can't even get them out the door  and I'm being serious. Can't even get them there. Forklift. OK  I see it as a triangle  OK  This is our landscape of food. I need you to understand it. You've probably heard all this before. Over the last    years  what's happened that's ripped the heart out of this country  Let's be frank and honest. Well  modern day life. Let's start with the Main Street. Fast food has taken over the whole country  we know that. The big brands are some of the most important powers  powerful powers  in this country. Supermarkets as well. Big companies. Big companies. Thirty years ago  most of the food was largely local and largely fresh. Now it's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives  extra ingredients  and you know the rest of the story. Portion size is obviously a massive  massive problem. Labeling is a massive problem. The labeling in this country is a disgrace. The industry wants to self police themselves. What  in this kind of climate  They don't deserve it. How can you say something is low fat when it's full of so much sugar  Home. The biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart of passing on food culture  what made our society. That is not happening anymore. And you know  as we go to work and as life changes  and as life always evolves  we kind of have to look at it holistically    step back for a moment  and re address the balance. It hasn't happened for    years  OK  I want to show you a situation that is very normal right now  the Edwards family. This stuff goes through you and your family's body every week. And I need you to know that this is going to kill your children early. How are you feeling  Stacy  Just feeling really sad and depressed right now. But  you know  I want my kids to succeed in life and this isn't going to get them there. But I'm killing them. JO  Yes you are. You are. But we can stop that. Normal. Let's get on schools  something that I'm fairly much a specialist in. OK  school. What is school  Who invented it  What's the purpose of school  School was always invented to arm us with the tools to make us creative  do wonderful things  make us earn a living  etc.  etc. You know  it's been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long  long time  OK  But we haven't really evolved it to deal with the health catastrophes of America  OK  School food is something that most kids       million a day  actually    have twice a day  more than often  breakfast and lunch      days of the year. So you could say that school food is quite important  really  judging the circumstances. Before I crack into my rant  which I'm sure you're waiting for    I need to say one thing  and it's so important in  hopefully  the magic that happens and unfolds in the next three months. The lunch ladies  the lunch cooks of America    I offer myself as their ambassador. I'm not slagging them off. They're doing the best they can do. They're doing their best. But they're doing what they're told  and what they're being told to do is wrong. The system is highly run by accountants  there's not enough  or any  food knowledgeable people in the business. There's a problem  If you're not a food expert  and you've got tight budgets and it's getting tighter  then you can't be creative  you can't duck and dive and write different things around things. If you're an accountant  and a box ticker  the only thing you can do in these circumstances is buy cheaper shit. Now  the reality is  the food that your kids get every day is fast food  it's highly processed  there's not enough fresh food in there at all. You know  the amount of additives  E numbers  ingredients you wouldn't believe    there's not enough veggies at all. French fries are considered a vegetable. Pizza for breakfast. They don't even get crockery. Knives and forks  No  they're too dangerous. They have scissors in the classroom  but knives and forks  No. And the way I look at it is  If you don't have knives and forks in your school  you're purely endorsing  from a state level  fast food  because it's handheld. And yes  by the way  it is fast food  It's sloppy Joes  it's burgers  it's wieners  it's pizzas  it's all of that stuff. Ten percent of what we spend on health care  as I said earlier  is on obesity  and it's going to double. We're not teaching our kids. There's no statutory right to teach kids about food  elementary or secondary school  OK  We don't teach kids about food  right  And this is a little clip from an elementary school  which is very common in England. Child  Potatoes. Jamie Oliver  Potato  So  you think these are potatoes  Do you know what that is  Do you know what that is  Child  Broccoli  JO  What about this  Our good old friend. Child  Celery. JO  No. What do you think this is  Child  Onion. JO  Onion  No. JO  Immediately you get a really clear sense of  Do the kids know anything about where food comes from   Who knows what that is  Child  Uh  pear  JO  What do you think this is  Child  I don't know. JO  If the kids don't know what stuff is  then they will never eat it. JO  Normal. England and America  England and America. Guess what fixed that. Two one hour sessions. We've got to start teaching our kids about food in schools  period. I want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we're in  guys  OK  I want to talk about something so basic as milk. Every kid has the right to milk at school. Your kids will be having milk at school  breakfast and lunch  right  They'll be having two bottles  OK  And most kids do. But milk ain't good enough anymore. Don't get me wrong  I support milk    but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings  colorings and sugar in milk  more kids will drink it. Yeah. Obviously now that's going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples they'll eat more as well. Do you know what I mean  For me  there isn't any need to flavor the milk. Okay  There's sugar in everything. I know the ins and outs of those ingredients. It's in everything. Even the milk hasn't escaped the kind of modern day problems. There's our milk. There's our carton. In that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop  and they are having two a day. So  let me just show you. We've got one kid  here    having  you know  eight tablespoons of sugar a day. You know  there's your week. There's your month. And I've taken the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar  just from milk. Now  I don't know about you guys  but judging the circumstances  right  any judge in the whole world  would look at the statistics and the evidence  and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse. That's my belief. Now  if I came up here  and I wish I could come up here today and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer  you'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me. This  all this bad news  is preventable. That's the good news. It's very  very preventable. So  let's just think about  we got a problem here  we need to reboot. Okay so  in my world  what do we need to do  Here is the thing  right  it cannot just come from one source. To reboot and make real tangible change  real change  so that I could look you in the white of the eyes and say   In    years' time  the history of your children's lives  happiness    and let's not forget  you're clever if you eat well  you know you're going to live longer    all of that stuff  it will look different. OK   So  supermarkets. Where else do you shop so religiously  Week in  week out. How much money do you spend  in your life  in a supermarket  Love them. They just sell us what we want. All right. They owe us to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket. They need to help us shop. They need to show us how to cook quick  tasty  seasonal meals for people that are busy. This is not expensive. It is done in some  and it needs to be done across the board in America soon  and quick. The big brands  you know  the food brands  need to put food education at the heart of their businesses. I know  easier said than done. It's the future. It's the only way. Fast food. With the fast food industry you know  it's very competitive. I've had loads of secret papers and dealings with fast food restaurants. I know how they do it. I mean  basically they've weaned us on to these hits of sugar  salt and fat  and x  y  and z  and everyone loves them  right  So  these guys are going to be part of the solution. But we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry  and over a five  six  seven year period wean of us off the extreme amounts of fat  sugar and all the other non food ingredients. Now  also  back to the sort of big brands  labeling  I said earlier  is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted. OK  school. Obviously  in schools  we owe it to them to make sure those     days of the year  from that little precious age of four  until             whatever  they need to be cooked proper  fresh food from local growers on site  OK  There needs to be a new standard of fresh  proper food for your children  yeah  Under the circumstances  it's profoundly important that every single American child leaves school knowing how to cook    recipes that will save their life. Life skills. That means that they can be students  young parents  and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking  no matter what recession hits them next time. If you can cook  recession money doesn't matter. If you can cook  time doesn't matter. The workplace  we haven't really talked about it. You know  it's now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff. The staff are the moms and dads of America's children. Marissa  her father died in her hand  I think she'd be quite happy if corporate America could start feeding their staff properly. Definitely they shouldn't be left out. Let's go back to the home. Now  look  if we do all this stuff  and we can  it's so achievable. You can care and be commercial. Absolutely. But the home needs to start passing on cooking again  for sure. For sure  pass it on as a philosophy. And for me  it's quite romantic  but it's about if one person teaches three people how to cook something  and they teach three of their mates  that only has to repeat itself    times  and that's the whole population of America. Romantic  yes  but most importantly  it's about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference. We've got to put back what's been lost. Huntington's Kitchen. Huntington  where I made this program  we've got this prime time program that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change. I truly believe that change will happen. Huntington's Kitchen. I work with a community. I worked in the schools. I found local sustainable funding to get every single school in the area from the junk  onto the fresh food  six and a half grand per school. That's all it takes  six and a half grand per school. The Kitchen is    grand a month. Okay  This can do       people a year  which is    percent of their population  and it's people on people. You know  it's local cooks teaching local people. It's free cooking lessons  guys  in the Main Street. This is real  tangible change  real  tangible change. Around America  if we just look back now  there is plenty of wonderful things going on. There is plenty of beautiful things going on. There are angels around America doing great things in schools    farm to school set ups  garden set ups  education    there are amazing people doing this already. The problem is they all want to roll out what they're doing to the next school  but there's no cash. We need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly  identify them  and allow them to easily find the resource to keep rolling out what they're already doing  and doing well. Businesses of America need to support Mrs. Obama to do the things that she wants to do. And look  I know it's weird having an English person standing here before you talking about all this. All I can say is  I care. I'm a father  and I love this country. And I believe truly  actually  that if change can be made in this country  beautiful things will happen around the world. If America does it  other people will follow. It's incredibly important. When I was in Huntington  trying to get a few things to work when they weren't  I thought  If I had a magic wand  what would I do   And I thought   You know what  I'd just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in America.  And a month later  TED phoned me up and gave me this award. I'm here. So  my wish. Dyslexic  so I'm a bit slow. My wish is for you to help a strong  sustainable movement to educate every child about food  to inspire families to cook again  and to empower people everywhere to fight obesity. Thank you. About a year and a half ago  Stephen Lawler  who also gave a talk here at TED in      on Virtual Earth  brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps  which is Microsoft's online mapping effort. In the past two and a half  we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online. And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to. So  the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning  which  if you're familiar at all with Seadragon  that's where it comes from. Mapping is  of course  not just about cartography  it's also about imagery. So  as we zoom in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City like virtual view at    degrees. This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the  D structure of the city  all the facades. Now  we see this space  this three dimensional environment  as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out  and map's directions are really just one of them. If you click on this  you'll see some of the ones that we've put out  just in the past couple of months since we've launched. So  for example  a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti  we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky. This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper local blogs in real time and mapping those stories  those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs. It's wonderful. But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff. So  we see the imagery  of course  not stopping at the sky. These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made. I'm not going to dive into them either  but photosynths are integrated into the map. Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well. And so  when you fly down    Thank you. When you fly down to the ground  and you see this kind of panoramic imagery  the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture  there's just as much three dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three dimensional city from above  so if I click on something to get a closer view of it  then  the fact that that transition looks as it does  is a function of all of that geometry  all of that  D understanding behind this model. Now  I'll show you a fun app that    we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr. This takes Flickr  georegistered imagery and uses photosynth like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery  so    I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up  but    But notice    this is  of course  a popular tourist site  and there are lots of photos around here  and these photos are all taken at different times. So this one was taken around five. So that's the Flickr photo  that's our imagery. So you really see how this kind of crowd sourced imagery is integrating  in a very deep way  into the map itself. Thank you. There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them  of course  is time travel. And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here  but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well. But what's cool about this is that  not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users  but it also is the foundation for augmented reality  and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment. Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting. OK  notice there's now a roof above us. We're inside the Pike Place Market. And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera  so  we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars  but we're also imaging inside. And from here  we're able to do the same sorts of registration  not only of still images  but also of video. So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time  live  and this is really  truly  very frightening. OK. All right  guys  are you there  All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play. I'm live. All right. There we go. So  these are our friends in Pike Place Market  the lab. So they're broadcasting this live. OK  George  can you pan back over to the corner market  Because I want to show points of interest. No  no. The other way. Yeah  yeah  back to the corner  back to the corner. I don't want to see you guys yet. OK  OK  back to the corner  back to the corner  back to the corner. OK  never mind. What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way  if you're actually on the spot  you can think about this    this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality. What the hell are you guys    oh  sorry. We're doing two different    OK  I'm hanging up now. We're doing two different things here. One of them is to take that real ... All right  let me just take a moment and thank the team. They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together. I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside. And while I walk outside  I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence  but you can equally well use this on the spot  for augmented reality. When you use it on the spot  it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you. So here  we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it. That was being broadcast  by the way  on a  G network from the market. All right  and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years. And that's Curtis Wong  WorldWide Telescope. So  we're going to head over to the dumpsters  where it's traditional  after a long day at the market  to go out for a break  but also stare up at the sky. This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps. This is the current    thank you    this is the current time. If we scrub the time  then we can see how the sky will look at different times  and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times  different dates  Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky  maybe change the date. I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. So  this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth. All right now  I've overrun my time  so I've got to stop. Thank you all very much. Someone once said that politics is  of course   showbiz for ugly people.  So  on that basis  I feel like I've really arrived. The other thing to think of is what an honor it is  as a politician  to give a TED talk  particularly here in the U.K.  where the reputation of politics  with the expenses scandal  has sunk so low. There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. And someone asked  Why   and they said   Well  there's no shortage of politicians  no one really minds what happens to them and  after all  there are some things that rats just won't do.  Now  I know you all love data  so I'm starting with a data rich slide. This  I think  is the most important fact to bear in mind in British politics or American politics  and that is  We have run out of money. We have vast budget deficits. This is my global public debt clock  and  as you can see  it's    trillion and counting. And I think what this leads to is a very simple recognition  that there's one question in politics at the moment above all other  and it's this one  How do we make things better without spending more money  Because there isn't going to be a lot of money to improve public services  or to improve government  or to improve so many of the things that politicians talk about. So what follows from that is that if you think it's all about money    you can only measure success in public services in health care and education and policing by spending more money  you can only measure progress by spending money    you're going to have a pretty miserable time. But if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being    things like your family relationships  friendship  community  values    then  actually  this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics. And the really simple argument I want to make tonight  the really straightforward argument is this  That if we combine the right political philosophy  the right political thinking  with the incredible information revolution that has taken place  and that all of you know so much more about than I do  I think there's an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics  remake government  remake public services  and achieve what's up on that slide  which is a big increase in our well being. That's the argument I want to make tonight. So  starting with the political philosophy. Now I'm not saying for a minute that British Conservatives have all the answers. Of course we don't. But there are two things at heart that I think drive a conservative philosophy that are really relevant to this whole debate. The first is this  We believe that if you give people more power and control over their lives  if you give people more choice  if you put them in the driving seat  then actually  you can create a stronger and better society. And if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance of information that we have in our world today  I think you can completely  as I've said  remake politics  remake government  remake your public services. The second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature. Politics and politicians will only succeed if they actually try and treat with people as they are  rather than as they would like them to be. Now  if you combine this very simple  very conservative thought    go with the grain of human nature    with all the advances in behavioral economics  some of which we were just hearing about  again  I think we can achieve a real increase in well being  in happiness  in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money. Now  why do I think now is the moment to make this argument  Well  I'm afraid you're going to suffer a short  condensed history lesson about what I would say are the three passages of history  the pre bureaucratic age  the bureaucratic age and what we now live in  which I think is a post bureaucratic age. A simpler way of thinking of it is that we have gone from a world of local control  then we went to a world of central control  and now we're in a world of people control. Local power  central power  now  people power. Now  here is King Cnut  king a thousand years ago. Thought he could turn back the waves  couldn't turn back the waves. Couldn't actually turn back very much  because if you were king a thousand years ago  while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country  there wasn't much you were in charge of. You weren't in charge of policing  justice  education  health  welfare. You could just about go to war and that was about it. This was the pre bureaucratic age  an age in which everything had to be local. You had to have local control because there was no nationally available information because travel was so restricted. So this was the pre bureaucratic age. Next part of the cold history lesson  the lovely picture of the British Industrial Revolution. Suddenly  all sorts of transport  travel information were possible  and this gave birth to  what I like to call  the bureaucratic age. And hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully. There we are. Suddenly  you have the big  strong  central state. It was able    but only it was able    to organize health care  education  policing  justice. And it was a world of  as I say  not local power  but now central power. It had sucked all that power up from the localities. It was able to do that itself. The next great stage  which all of you are so familiar with  the massive information revolution. Just consider this one fact  One hundred years ago  sending these    words cost    dollars. Right now  here we are linked up to Long Beach and everywhere else  and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost  and we can send and receive huge quantities of information without it costing anything. So we're now living in a post bureaucratic age  where genuine people power is possible. Now  what does this mean for our politics  for our public services  for our government  Well I can't  in the time I've got  give huge numbers of examples  but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change. And this is so obvious  in a way  because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop  the way we travel  the way that business is done. That is already happened  the information and Internet revolution has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways  but it hasn't  in every way  yet touched our government. So  how could this happen  Well  I think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference  in transparency  in greater choice and in accountability  in giving us that genuine people power. If we take transparency  here is one of my favorite websites  the Missouri Accountability Portal. In the old days  only the government could hold the information  and only a few elected people could try and grab that information and question it and challenge it. Now here  on one website  one state in America  every single dollar spent by that government is searchable  is analyzable  is checkable. Think of the huge change that means  Any business that wants to bid for a government contract can see what currently is being spent. Anyone thinking   I could do that service better  I could deliver it cheaper   it's all available there. We have only  in government and in politics  started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world with the information revolution. So  complete transparency will make a huge difference. In this country  if we win the election  we are going to make all government spending over        pounds transparent and available online  searchable for anyone to see. We're going to make every contract    we're announcing this today    available on the Internet so anyone can see what the terms are  what the conditions are  driving huge value for money  but also huge increases  I believe  in well being as well. Choice. Now you all shop online  compare online  do everything online  and yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface of public services like education  or health care or policing  and you're going to see this change massively. We should be making this change with the information revolution in our country  with searchable health sites  so you can see what operations work out properly  what records doctors have  the cleanliness of hospitals  who does best at infection control    all of the information that would once be locked in the Department of Health is now available for all of us to see. And the third of these big changes  accountability. This  I think  is a huge change. It is a crime map. This is a crime map from Chicago. So  instead of having a situation where only the police have the information about which crimes are committed where  and we have to employ people in government to try and hold the police to account  suddenly  we've got this vast opportunity for people power  where we  as citizens  can see what crimes are being committed    where  when and by whom    and we can hold the police to account. And you can see this looks a bit like a chef's hat  but actually that's an assault  the one in blue. You can see what crime is committed where  and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account. So those three ways    transparency  accountability and choice    will make a huge difference. Now I also said the other principle that I think we should work on is understanding of people  is recognizing that going with the grain of human nature you can achieve so much more. Now  we're got a huge revolution in understanding of why people behave in the way that they do  and a great opportunity to put that knowledge and information to greater use. We're working with some of these people. We're being advised by some of these people  as was said  to try and bring all the experience to book. Let me just give you one example that I think is incredibly simple  and I love. We want to get people to be more energy efficient. Why  It cuts fuel poverty  it cuts their bills  and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time. How do you do it  Well  we've had government information campaigns over the years when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home. We even had    one government minister once told us to brush our teeth in the dark. I don't think they lasted very long. Look at what this does. This is a simple piece of behavioral economics. The best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill is to show them their own spending  to show them what their neighbors are spending  and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending. That sort of behavioral economics can transform people's behavior in a way that all the bullying and all the information and all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve. Other examples are recycling. We all know we need to recycle more. How do we make it happen  All the proof from America is that actually  if you pay people to recycle  if you give them a carrot rather than a stick  you can transform their behavior. So what does all this add up to  Here are my two favorite U.S. speeches of the last    years. Obviously  here we have JFK with that incredibly simple and powerful formulation   Ask not what your country can do for you  ask what you can do for your country   an incredibly noble sentiment. But when he made that speech  what could you do to build the stronger  better society  You could fight for your country  you could die for your country  you could serve in your country's civil service  but you didn't really have the information and the knowledge and the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now. And I think an even more wonderful speech  which I'm going to read a big chunk of  which sums up what I said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money  and more that we should try and measure than money. And it is Robert Kennedy's beautiful description of why gross national product captures so little  It  does not allow for the health of our children  the quality of their education  or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages  the intelligence of our public debate. It measures neither our wit nor our courage  neither our wisdom nor our learning  neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything  in short  except that which makes life worthwhile.  Again  a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put    years ago  and a beautiful dream    years ago  but now with the huge advances in information technology  with the massive changes in behavioral economics  with all that we know about how you advance well being  that if we combine those insights of giving power to people  and using information to make that possible  and using the insight of going with the grain of human nature  while at the same time  understanding why people behave in the way they do  it is a dream more easy to realize today than it was when it was made in that beautiful speech    years ago. Thank you. I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago while writing an article for Italian Wired. I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything  but I'd already finished editing the piece  and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word  disabled  to see what I'd find. Let me read you the entry.  Disabled  adjective  crippled  helpless  useless  wrecked  stalled  maimed  wounded  mangled  lame  mutilated  run down  worn out  weakened  impotent  castrated  paralyzed  handicapped  senile  decrepit  laid up  done up  done for  done in cracked up  counted out  see also hurt  useless and weak. Antonyms  healthy  strong  capable.  I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing  it was so ludicrous  but I'd just gotten past  mangled   and my voice broke  and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed. You know  of course  this is my raggedy old thesaurus so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date  right  But  in fact  the print date was the early     s  when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me. And  needless to say  thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then. I mean  from this entry  it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them  when in fact  today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured. So  I immediately went to look up the      online edition  expecting to find a revision worth noting. Here's the updated version of this entry. Unfortunately  it's not much better. I find the last two words under  Near Antonyms   particularly unsettling   whole  and  wholesome.  So  it's not just about the words. It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words. It's about the values behind the words  and how we construct those values. Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people. In fact  many ancient societies  including the Greeks and the Romans  believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful  because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence. So  what reality do we want to call into existence  a person who is limited  or a person who's empowered  By casually doing something as simple as naming a person  a child  we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power. Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead  One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington  Delaware. His name was Dr. Pizzutillo  an Italian American  whose name  apparently  was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce  so he went by Dr. P. And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children. I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital  with the exception of my physical therapy sessions. I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick  elastic bands    different colors  you know    to help build up my leg muscles  and I hated these bands more than anything    I hated them  had names for them. I hated them. And  you know  I was already bargaining  as a five year old child  with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises  unsuccessfully  of course. And  one day  he came in to my session    exhaustive and unforgiving  these sessions    and he said to me   Wow. Aimee  you are such a strong and powerful little girl  I think you're going to break one of those bands. When you do break it  I'm going to give you a hundred bucks.  Now  of course  this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward  but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me. And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong  powerful and athletic person well into the future. This is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child. But  in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries  our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want  the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable. Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society  many of which have been brought about by technology. Certainly  from a medical standpoint  my legs  laser surgery for vision impairment  titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities  and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them    not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify  to claim their own descriptions of themselves  so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing. So  perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth  that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society  and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset. The human ability to adapt  it's an interesting thing  because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity  and I'm going to make an admission  This phrase never sat right with me  and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it  and I think I'm starting to figure out why. Implicit in this phrase of  overcoming adversity  is the idea that success  or happiness  is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience  as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics  or what other people perceive as my disability. But  in fact  we are changed. We are marked  of course  by a challenge  whether physically  emotionally or both. And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing. Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life. It's part of our life. And I tend to think of it like my shadow. Sometimes I see a lot of it  sometimes there's very little  but it's always with me. And  certainly  I'm not trying to diminish the impact  the weight  of a person's struggle. There is adversity and challenge in life  and it's all very real and relative to every single person  but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity  but how you're going to meet it. So  our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity  but preparing them to meet it well. And we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt. There's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled. And  truthfully  the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions. In our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold  hard truth about their medical prognosis  or  indeed  a prognosis on the expected quality of their life  we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone. Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it  serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself. By not treating the wholeness of a person  by not acknowledging their potency  we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have. We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community. So we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability. And  most importantly  there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability. So it's not about devaluing  or negating  these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug  but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity. So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it  embracing it  grappling with it  to use a wrestling term  maybe even dancing with it. And  perhaps  if we see adversity as natural  consistent and useful  we're less burdened by the presence of it. This year we celebrate the    th birthday of Charles Darwin  and it was     years ago  when writing about evolution  that Darwin illustrated  I think  a truth about the human character. To paraphrase  It's not the strongest of the species that survives  nor is it the most intelligent that survives  it is the one that is most adaptable to change. Conflict is the genesis of creation. From Darwin's work  amongst others  we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation. So  again  transformation  adaptation  is our greatest human skill. And  perhaps  until we're tested  we don't know what we're made of. Maybe that's what adversity gives us  a sense of self  a sense of our own power. So  we can give ourselves a gift. We can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times. Maybe we can see it as change. Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet. I think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy. Now  who's normal  There's no normal. There's common  there's typical. There's no normal  and would you want to meet that poor  beige person if they existed  I don't think so. If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility    or potency  to be even a little bit more dangerous    we can release the power of so many more children  and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community. Anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use  to be able to contribute. There's evidence that Neanderthals         years ago  carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury  and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community. They didn't view these people as broken and useless  they were seen as rare and valuable. A few years ago  I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania  and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes. It was summertime  I had shorts on. I hear this guy  his voice behind me say   Well  if it isn't Aimee Mullins.  And I turn around  and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is. And I said   I'm sorry  sir  have we met  I don't remember meeting you.  He said   Well  you wouldn't remember meeting me. I mean  when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb.  Oh  that guy. And  but of course  actually  it did click. This man was Dr. Kean  a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day  because  of course  typical fashion  I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks. And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation  so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents. And  because I was born without the fibula bones  and had feet turned in  and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that  he had to be the bearer    this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news. He said to me   I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk  and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence  and you've been making liar out of me ever since.  The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood  whether winning a second grade spelling bee  marching with the Girl Scouts  you know  the Halloween parade  winning my college scholarship  or any of my sports victories  and he was using it  and integrating it into teaching resident students  med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School. And he called this part of the course the X Factor  the potential of the human will. No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone's life. And Dr. Kean went on to tell me  he said   In my experience  unless repeatedly told otherwise  and even if given a modicum of support  if left to their own devices  a child will achieve.  See  Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking. He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it. And there's been a shift in my thinking over time  in that  if you had asked me at    years old  if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs  I wouldn't have hesitated for a second. I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then. But if you ask me today  I'm not so sure. And it's because of the experiences I've had with them  not in spite of the experiences I've had with them. And perhaps this shift in me has happened because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me. See  all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power  and you're off. If you can hand somebody the key to their own power    the human spirit is so receptive    if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment  you are educating them in the best sense. You're teaching them to open doors for themselves. In fact  the exact meaning of the word  educate  comes from the root word  educe.  It means  to bring forth what is within  to bring out potential.  So again  which potential do we want to bring out  There was a case study done in     s Britain  when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools. It's called the streaming trials. We call it  tracking  here in the States. It's separating students from A  B  C  D and so on. And the  A students  get the tougher curriculum  the best teachers  etc. Well  they took  over a three month period  D level students  gave them A's  told them they were  A's   told them they were bright  and at the end of this three month period  they were performing at A level. And  of course  the heartbreaking  flip side of this study  is that they took the  A students  and told them they were  D's.  And that's what happened at the end of that three month period. Those who were still around in school  besides the people who had dropped out. A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too. The teachers didn't know a switch had been made. They were simply told   These are the 'A students ' these are the 'D students.'  And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them. So  I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit  a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope  it doesn't see beauty  it no longer has our natural  childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine. If instead  we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope  to see beauty in themselves and others  to be curious and imaginative  then we are truly using our power well. When a spirit has those qualities  we are able to create new realities and new ways of being. I'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century Persian poet named Hafiz that my friend  Jacques Dembois told me about  and the poem is called  The God Who Only Knows Four Words    Every child has known God  not the God of names  not the God of don'ts  but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them  saying  'Come dance with me. Come  dance with me. Come  dance with me.'  Thank you. I'm going to talk today about energy and climate. And that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds  about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives. But energy and climate are extremely important to these people    in fact  more important than to anyone else on the planet. The climate getting worse means that many years  their crops won't grow  There will be too much rain  not enough rain  things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support. And that leads to starvation  it leads to uncertainty  it leads to unrest. So  the climate changes will be terrible for them. Also  the price of energy is very important to them. In fact  if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of  to reduce poverty  by far you would pick energy. Now  the price of energy has come down over time. Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy. The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution  and  even in the     s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity  and that's why we have refrigerators  air conditioning  we can make modern materials and do so many things. And so  we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world. But  as we make it cheaper    and let's go for making it twice as cheap    we need to meet a new constraint  and that constraint has to do with CO . CO  is warming the planet  and the equation on CO  is actually a very straightforward one. If you sum up the CO  that gets emitted  that leads to a temperature increase  and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects  the effects on the weather  perhaps worse  the indirect effects  in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes  and so you get ecosystem collapses. Now  the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO  to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are  there's some uncertainty there  but not very much. And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be  but they will be extremely bad. I asked the top scientists on this several times  Do we really have to get down to near zero  Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter  And the answer is that until we get near to zero  the temperature will continue to rise. And so that's a big challenge. It's very different than saying  We're a twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge  and we can just sort of squeeze under.  This is something that has to get to zero. Now  we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year  over    billion tons. For each American  it's about    tons  for people in poor countries  it's less than one ton. It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet. And  somehow  we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero. It's been constantly going up. It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all  so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling  and falling all the way to zero. This equation has four factors  a little bit of multiplication  So  you've got a thing on the left  CO   that you want to get to zero  and that's going to be based on the number of people  the services each person's using on average  the energy on average for each service  and the CO  being put out per unit of energy. So  let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero. Probably  one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero. Now that's back from high school algebra  but let's take a look. First  we've got population. The world today has  .  billion people. That's headed up to about nine billion. Now  if we do a really great job on new vaccines  health care  reproductive health services  we could lower that by  perhaps     or    percent  but there we see an increase of about  . . The second factor is the services we use. This encompasses everything  the food we eat  clothing  TV  heating. These are very good things  getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet. And it's a great thing for this number to go up. In the rich world  perhaps the top one billion  we probably could cut back and use less  but every year  this number  on average  is going to go up  and so  over all  that will more than double the services delivered per person. Here we have a very basic service  Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework  And  in fact  these kids don't  so they're going out and reading their school work under the street lamps. Now  efficiency  E  the energy for each service  here finally we have some good news. We have something that's not going up. Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting  through different types of cars  different ways of building buildings    there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially. Some individual services even bring it down by    percent. There are other services like how we make fertilizer  or how we do air transport  where the rooms for improvement are far  far less. And so  overall here  if we're optimistic  we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even  perhaps  a factor of six. But for these first three factors now  we've gone from    billion to  at best  maybe    billion tons  and that just won't cut it. So let's look at this fourth factor    this is going to be a key one    and this is the amount of CO  put out per each unit of energy. And so the question is  Can you actually get that to zero  If you burn coal  no. If you burn natural gas  no. Almost every way we make electricity today  except for the emerging renewables and nuclear  puts out CO . And so  what we're going to have to do at a global scale  is create a new system. And so  we need energy miracles. Now  when I use the term  miracle   I don't mean something that's impossible. The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle. The Internet and its services are a miracle. So  the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles. Usually  we don't have a deadline  where you have to get the miracle by a certain date. Usually  you just kind of stand by  and some come along  some don't. This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline. Now  I thought   How could I really capture this  Is there some kind of natural illustration  some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here   I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos  and somehow people enjoyed that. It really got them involved in the idea of  you know  there are people who live with mosquitos. So  with energy  all I could come up with is this. I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year. So here we have some natural fireflies. I'm told they don't bite  in fact  they might not even leave that jar. Now  there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one  but they don't really add up to much. We need solutions    either one or several    that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability  and  although there's many directions people are seeking  I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers. I've left out tide  geothermal  fusion  biofuels. Those may make some contribution  and if they can do better than I expect  so much the better  but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five  and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting  because they all have significant challenges. Let's look first at the burning fossil fuels  either burning coal or burning natural gas. What you need to do there  seems like it might be simple  but it's not  and that's to take all the CO   after you've burned it  going out the flue  pressurize it  create a liquid  put it somewhere  and hope it stays there. Now we have some pilot things that do this at the    to    percent level  but getting up to that full percentage  that will be very tricky  and agreeing on where these CO  quantities should be put will be hard  but the toughest one here is this long term issue. Who's going to be sure  Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things  This is a lot of volume. So that's a tough one. Next would be nuclear. It also has three big problems  Cost  particularly in highly regulated countries  is high  the issue of the safety  really feeling good about nothing could go wrong  that  even though you have these human operators  that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons. And then what do you do with the waste  And  although it's not very large  there are a lot of concerns about that. People need to feel good about it. So three very tough problems that might be solvable  and so  should be worked on. The last three of the five  I've grouped together. These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources. And they actually    although it's great they don't require fuel    they have some disadvantages. One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant. This is energy farming  so you're talking about many square miles  thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant. Also  these are intermittent sources. The sun doesn't shine all day  it doesn't shine every day  and  likewise  the wind doesn't blow all the time. And so  if you depend on these sources  you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it's not available. So  we've got big cost challenges here  we have transmission challenges  for example  say this energy source is outside your country  you not only need the technology  but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere. And  finally  this storage problem. And  to dimensionalize this  I went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made    for cars  for computers  for phones  for flashlights  for everything    and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses  and what I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than    minutes of all the energy. And so  in fact  we need a big breakthrough here  something that's going to be a factor of     better than the approaches we have now. It's not impossible  but it's not a very easy thing. Now  this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above  say     to    percent of what you're using. If you're counting on it for     percent  you need an incredible miracle battery. Now  how we're going to go forward on this    what's the right approach  Is it a Manhattan Project  What's the thing that can get us there  Well  we need lots of companies working on this  hundreds. In each of these five paths  we need at least a hundred people. And a lot of them  you'll look at and say   They're crazy.  That's good. And  I think  here in the TED group  we have many people who are already pursuing this. Bill Gross has several companies  including one called eSolar that has some great solar thermal technologies. Vinod Khosla's investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities  and I'm trying to help back that. Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that  perhaps surprisingly  is actually taking the nuclear approach. There are some innovations in nuclear  modular  liquid. And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago  so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising. The idea of TerraPower is that  instead of burning a part of uranium    the one percent  which is the U       we decided   Let's burn the    percent  the U   .  It is kind of a crazy idea. In fact  people had talked about it for a long time  but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not  and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that  yes  with the right material's approach  this looks like it would work. And  because you're burning that    percent  you have greatly improved cost profile. You actually burn up the waste  and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today's reactors. So  instead of worrying about them  you just take that. It's a great thing. It breathes this uranium as it goes along  so it's kind of like a candle. You can see it's a log there  often referred to as a traveling wave reactor. In terms of fuel  this really solves the problem. I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky. This is the leftover  the    percent  where they've taken out the part they burn now  so it's called depleted uranium. That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years. And  simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process  you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet. So  you know  it's got lots of challenges ahead  but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward. So let's think  How should we measure ourselves  What should our report card look like  Well  let's go out to where we really need to get  and then look at the intermediate. For       you've heard many people talk about this    percent reduction. That really is very important  that we get there. And that    percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries  still some agriculture  hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry  cement. So  to get to that    percent  the developed countries  including countries like China  will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether. So  the other grade is  Are we deploying this zero emission technology  have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it elsewhere  That's super important. That's a key element of making that report card. So  backing up from there  what should the      report card look like  Well  again  it should have the two elements. We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions  The less we emit  the less that sum will be of CO   and  therefore  the less the temperature. But in some ways  the grade we get there  doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions  is only equally  or maybe even slightly less  important than the other  which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs. These breakthroughs  we need to move those at full speed  and we can measure that in terms of companies  pilot projects  regulatory things that have been changed. There's a lot of great books that have been written about this. The Al Gore book   Our Choice  and the David McKay book   Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air.  They really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly  because we need broad backing for this. There's a lot that has to come together. So this is a wish. It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology. If you gave me only one wish for the next    years    I could pick who's president  I could pick a vaccine  which is something I love  or I could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no CO  gets invented    this is the wish I would pick. This is the one with the greatest impact. If we don't get this wish  the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible  between the U.S. and China  between poor countries and rich  and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse. So  what do we have to do  What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive  We need to go for more research funding. When countries get together in places like Copenhagen  they shouldn't just discuss the CO . They should discuss this innovation agenda  and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches. We do need the market incentives    CO  tax  cap and trade    something that gets that price signal out there. We need to get the message out. We need to have this dialogue be a more rational  more understandable dialogue  including the steps that the government takes. This is an important wish  but it is one I think we can achieve. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So to understand more about TerraPower  right    I mean  first of all  can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is  Bil Gates  To actually do the software  buy the supercomputer  hire all the great scientists  which we've done  that's only tens of millions  and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly  then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions. The tough thing is building the pilot reactor  finding the several billion  finding the regulator  the location that will actually build the first one of these. Once you get the first one built  if it works as advertised  then it's just clear as day  because the economics  the energy density  are so different than nuclear as we know it. CA  And so  to understand it right  this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel  of this sort of spent uranium  and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down  BG  That's right. Today  you're always refueling the reactor  so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong  that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out  that's not good. So  if you have very cheap fuel that you can put    years in    just think of it as a log    put it down and not have those same complexities. And it just sits there and burns for the    years  and then it's done. CA  It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution. BG  Yeah. Well  what happens with the waste  you can let it sit there    there's a lot less waste under this approach    then you can actually take that  and put it into another one and burn that. And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today  that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors    that's our fuel to begin with. So  the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours  and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you're going through this process. CA  I mean  you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here. Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this  BG  Well  we haven't picked a particular place  and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called  nuclear   so we've got a lot of interest  that people from the company have been in Russia  India  China    I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here  talking about how this fits into the energy agenda. So I'm optimistic. You know  the French and Japanese have done some work. This is a variant on something that has been done. It's an important advance  but it's like a fast reactor  and a lot of countries have built them  so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built. CA  So  in your mind  timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live  BG  Well  we need    for one of these high scale  electro generation things that's very cheap  we have    years to invent and then    years to deploy. That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet. And  you know  TerraPower  if things go well    which is wishing for a lot    could easily meet that. And there are  fortunately now  dozens of companies    we need it to be hundreds    who  likewise  if their science goes well  if the funding for their pilot plants goes well  that they can compete for this. And it's best if multiple succeed  because then you could use a mix of these things. We certainly need one to succeed. CA  In terms of big scale possible game changes  is this the biggest that you're aware of out there  BG  An energy breakthrough is the most important thing. It would have been  even without the environmental constraint  but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater. In the nuclear space  there are other innovators. You know  we don't know their work as well as we know this one  but the modular people  that's a different approach. There's a liquid type reactor  which seems a little hard  but maybe they say that about us. And so  there are different ones  but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of  say  coal  and so    if you can deal with the negatives  which are essentially the radiation    the footprint and cost  the potential  in terms of effect on land and various things  is almost in a class of its own. CA  If this doesn't work  then what  Do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable  BG  If you get into that situation  it's like if you've been over eating  and you're about to have a heart attack  Then where do you go  You may need heart surgery or something. There is a line of research on what's called geoengineering  which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us    or    years to get our act together. Now  that's just an insurance policy. You hope you don't need to do that. Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy  that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you. I'm not sure that's wise  given the importance of the problem  but there's now the geoengineering discussion about    should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster  or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect  CA  Climate skeptics  If you had a sentence or two to say to them  how might you persuade them that they're wrong  BG  Well  unfortunately  the skeptics come in different camps. The ones who make scientific arguments are very few. Are they saying that there's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things  There are very  very few things that they can even say there's a chance in a million of those things. The main problem we have here  it's kind of like AIDS. You make the mistake now  and you pay for it a lot later. And so  when you have all sorts of urgent problems  the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later  and a somewhat uncertain pain thing    in fact  the IPCC report  that's not necessarily the worst case  and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say   OK  that isn't that big of a deal.  The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this. But my dream here is that  if you can make it economic  and meet the CO  constraints  then the skeptics say   OK  I don't care that it doesn't put out CO   I kind of wish it did put out CO   but I guess I'll accept it because it's cheaper than what's come before.  CA  And so  that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument  that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO  problem  it's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth  it's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do. BG  Well  the actual spending on the R D piece    say the U.S. should spend    billion a year more than it is right now    it's not that dramatic. It shouldn't take away from other things. The thing you get into big money on  and this  reasonable people can disagree  is when you have something that's non economic and you're trying to fund that    that  to me  mostly is a waste. Unless you're very close and you're just funding the learning curve and it's going to get very cheap  I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive. If the trade off you get into is   Let's make energy super expensive   then the rich can afford that. I mean  all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle. The disaster is for that two billion. And even Lomborg has changed. His shtick now is   Why isn't the R D getting more discussed   He's still  because of his earlier stuff  still associated with the skeptic camp  but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp  and so  he's making the R D point. And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate. The R D piece  it's crazy how little it's funded. CA  Well Bill  I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true. Thank you so much. BG  Thank you. I want to talk about my investigations into what technology means in our lives    not just our immediate life  but in the cosmic sense  in the kind of long history of the world and our place in the world  What is this stuff  What is the significance  And so  I want to kind of go through my little story of what I found out. And one of the first things that I started to investigate was the history of the name of technology. And in the United States there is a State of the Union address given by every president since     . And each one of those is really kind of summing up the most important things for the United States at that time. If you search for the word  technology   it was not used until     . So  technology was sort of absent from everybody's thinking until       which happened to be the year of my birth. And obviously  technology had existed before then  but we weren't aware of it  and so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life. I actually did research to find out the first use of the word  technology.  It was in       and it was invented by a guy who was starting a curriculum    a course  bringing together all the kinds of arts and crafts  and industry    and he called it  Technology.  And that's the very first use of the word. So  what is this stuff that we're all consumed by  and bothered by  Alan Kay calls it   Technology is anything that was invented after you were born.  Which is sort of the idea that we normally have about what technology is  It's all that new stuff. It's not roads  or penicillin  or factory tires  it's the new stuff. My friend Danny Hillis says kind of a similar one  he says   Technology is anything that doesn't work yet.  Which is  again  a sense that it's all new. But we know that it's just not new. It actually goes way back  and what I want to suggest is it goes a long way back. So  another way to think about technology  what it means  is to imagine a world without technology. If we were to eliminate every single bit of technology in the world today    and I mean everything  from blades to scrapers to cloth    we as a species would not live very long. We would die by the billions  and very quickly  The wolves would get us  we would be defenseless  we would be unable to grow enough food  or find enough food. Even the hunter gatherers used some elementary tools. And so  they had minimal technology  but they had some technology. And if we study those hunter gatherer tribes and the Neanderthal  which are very similar to early man  we find out a very curious thing about this world without technology  and this is a kind of a curve of their average age. There are no Neanderthal fossils that are older than    years old that we've ever found  and the average age of most of these hunter gatherer tribes is    to   . There are very few young infants because they die    high mortality rate    and there's very few old people. And so the profile is sort of for your average San Francisco neighborhood  a lot of young people. And if you go there  you say   Hey  everybody's really healthy.  Well  that's because they're all young. And the same thing with the hunter gatherer tribes and early man is that you didn't live beyond the age of   . So  it was a world without grandparents. And grandparents are very important  because they are the transmitter of cultural evolution and information. Imagine a world and basically everybody was    to    years old. How much learning can you do  You can't do very much learning in your own life  it's so short  and there's nobody to pass on what you do learn. So  that's one aspect. It was a very short life. But at the same time anthropologists know that most hunter gatherer tribes of the world  with that very little technology  actually did not spend a very long time gathering the food that they needed  three to six hours a day. Some anthropologists call that the original affluent society. Because they had banker hours basically. So  it was possible to get enough food. But when the scarcity came when the highs and lows and the droughts came  then people went into starvation. And that's why they didn't live very long. So  what technology brought  through the very simple tools like these stone tools here    even something as small as this    the early bands of humans were actually able to eliminate to extinction about     megafauna animals in North America when they first arrived        years ago. So  long before the industrial age we've been affecting the planet on a global scale  with just a small amount of technology. The other thing that the early man invented was fire. And fire was used to clear out  and again  affected the ecology of grass and whole continents  and was used in cooking. It enabled us to actually eat all kinds of things. It was sort of  in a certain sense  in a McLuhan sense  an external stomach  in the sense that it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise. And if we don't have fire  we actually could not live. Our bodies have adapted to these new diets. Our bodies have changed in the last        years. So  with that little bit of technology  humans went from a small band of        or so    the same number as Neanderthals everywhere    and we suddenly exploded. With the invention of language around        years ago  the number of humans exploded  and very quickly became the dominant species on the planet. And they migrated into the rest of the world at two kilometers per year until  within several tens of thousands of years  we occupied every single watershed on the planet and became the most dominant species  with a very small amount of technology. And even at that time  with the introduction of agriculture                years ago we started to see climate change. So  climate change is not a new thing. What's new is just the degree of it. Even during the agricultural age there was climate change. And so  already small amounts of technology were transforming the world. And what this means  and where I'm going  is that technology has become the most powerful force in the world. All the things that we see today that are changing our lives  we can always trace back to the introduction of some new technology. So  it's a force that is the most powerful force that has been unleashed on this planet  and in such a degree that I think that it's become our    who we are. In fact  our humanity  and everything that we think about ourselves is something that we've invented. So  we've invented ourselves. Of all the animals that we have domesticated  the most important animal that we've domesticated has been us. Okay  So  humanity is our greatest invention. But of course we're not done yet. We're still inventing  and this is what technology is allowing us to do    it's continually to reinvent ourselves. It's a very  very strong force. I call this entire thing    us humans as our technology  everything that we've made  gadgets in our lives    we call that the technium. That's this world. My working definition of technology is  anything useful that a human mind makes.  It's not just hammers and gadgets  like laptops. But it's also law. And of course cities are ways to make things more useful to us. While this is something that comes from our mind  it also has its roots deeply into the cosmos. It goes back. The origins and roots of technology go back to the Big Bang  in this way  in that they are part of this self organizing thread that starts at the Big Bang and goes through galaxies and stars  into life  into us. And the three major phases of the early universe was energy  when the dominant force was energy  then it became  the dominant force  as it cooled  became matter  and then  with the invention of life  four billion years ago  the dominant force in our neighborhood became information. That's what life is  It's an information process that was restructuring and making new order. So  those energy  matter Einstein show were equivalent  and now new sciences of quantum computing show that entropy and information and matter and energy are all interrelated  so it's one long continuum. You put energy into the right kind of system and out comes wasted heat  entropy and extropy  which is order. It's the increased order. Where does this order come from  Its roots go way back. We actually don't know. But we do know that the self organization trend throughout the universe is long  and it began with things like galaxies  they maintained their order for billions of years. Stars are basically nuclear fusion machines that self organize and self sustain themselves for billions of years  this order against the entropy of the world. And flowers and plants are the same thing  extended  and technology is basically an extension of life. One trend that we notice in all those things is that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through this  is actually increasing. The amount of energy is increasing through this little sequence. And that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through life is actually greater than a star    because of the star's long lifespan  the energy density in life is actually higher than a star. And the energy density that we see in the greatest of anywhere in the universe is actually in a PC chip. There is more energy flowing through  per gram per second  than anything that we have any other experience with. What I would suggest is that if you want to see where technology is going  we continue that trajectory  and we say  Well what's going to become more energy dense  that's where it's going.  And so what I've done is  I've taken the same kinds of things and looked at other aspects of evolutionary life and say   What are the general trends in evolutionary life   And there are things moving towards greater complexity  moving towards greater diversity  moving towards greater specialization  sentience  ubiquity and most important  evolvability  Those very same things are also present in technology. That's where technology is going. In fact  technology is accelerating all the aspects of life  and we can see that happening  just as there's diversity in life  there's more diversity in things we make. Things in life start out being general cell  and they become specialized  You have tissue cells  you have muscle  brain cells. And same things happens with say  a hammer  which is general at first and becomes more specific. So  I would like to say that while there is six kingdoms of life  we can think of technology basically as a seventh kingdom of life. It's a branching off from the human form. But technology has its own agenda  like anything  like life itself. For instance  right now  three quarters of the energy that we use is actually used to feed the technium itself. In transportation  it's not to move us  it's to move the stuff that we make or buy. I use the word  want.  Technology wants. This is a robot that wants to plug itself in to get more power. Your cat wants more food. A bacterium  which has no consciousness at all  wants to move towards light. It has an urge  and technology has an urge. At the same time  it wants to give us things  and what it gives us is basically progress. You can take all kinds of curves  and they're all pointing up. There's really no dispute about progress  if we discount the cost of that. And that's the thing that bothers most people  is that progress is really real  but we wonder and question  What are the environmental costs of it  I did a survey of a number of species of artifacts in my house  and there's      . Other people have come up with       . When King Henry of England died  he had        things in his house  but that was the entire wealth of England. And with that entire wealth of England  King Henry could not buy any antibiotics  he could not buy refrigeration  he could not buy a trip of a thousand miles. Whereas this rickshaw wale in India could save up and buy antibiotics and he could buy refrigeration. He could buy things that King Henry  in all his wealth  could never buy. That's what progress is about. So  technology is selfish  technology is generous. That conflict  that tension  will be with us forever  that sometimes it wants to do what it wants to do  and sometimes it's going to do things for us. We have confusion about what we should think about a new technology. Right now the default position about when a new technology comes along  is we    people talk about the precautionary principle  which is very common in Europe  which says  basically   Don't do anything. When you meet a new technology  stop  until it can be proven that there's no harm.  I think that really leads nowhere. But a better way is to  what I call proactionary principle  which is  You engage with technology. You try it out. You obviously do what the precautionary principle suggests  you try to anticipate it  but after anticipating it  you constantly asses it  not just once  but eternally. And when it diverts from what you want  we prioritize risk  we evaluate not just the new stuff  but the old stuff. We fix it  but most importantly  we relocate it. And what I mean by that is that we find a new job for it. Nuclear energy  fission  is really bad idea for bombs. But it may be a pretty good idea relocated into sustainable nuclear energy for electricity  instead of burning coal. When we have a bad idea  the response to a bad idea is not no ideas  it's not to stop thinking. The response to a bad idea    like  say  a tungsten light bulb    is a better idea. OK  So  better ideas is really    always the response to technology that we don't like is basically  better technology. And actually  in a certain sense  technology is a kind of a method for generating better ideas  if you can think about it that way. So  maybe spraying DDT on crops is a really bad idea. But DDT sprayed on local homes  there's nothing better to eliminate malaria  besides insect DDT impregnated mosquito nets. But that's a really good idea  that's a good job for technology. So  our job as humans is to parent our mind children  to find them good friends  to find them a good job. And so  every technology is sort of a creative force looking for the right job. That's actually my son  right here. There are no bad technologies  just as there are no bad children. We don't say children are neutral  children are positive. We just have to find them the right place. And so  what technology gives us  over the long term  over the sort of extended evolution    from the beginning of time  through the invention of the plants and animals  and the evolution of life  the evolution of brains    what that is constantly giving us is increasing differences  It's increasing diversity  it's increasing options  it's increasing choices  opportunities  possibilities and freedoms. That's what we get from technology all the time. That's why people leave villages and go into cities  is because they are always gravitating towards increased choices and possibilities. And we are aware of the price. We pay a price for that  but we are aware of it  and generally we will pay the price for increased freedoms  choices and opportunities. Even technology wants clean water. Is technology diametrically opposed to nature  Because technology is an extension of life  it's in parallel and aligned with the same things that life wants. So that I think technology loves biology  if we allow it to. Great movement that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go  and our choice  so to speak  in technology  is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves. So  technology is more than just the stuff in your pocket. It's more than just gadgets  it's more than just things that people invent. It's actually part of a very long story  a great story  that began billions of years ago. And it's moving through us  this self organization  and we're extending and accelerating it  and we can be part of it by aligning the technology that we make with it. I really appreciate your attention today. Thank you. I've always been interested in the relationship of formal structures and human behavior. If you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town  people will move there. Well  law is also a powerful driver of human behavior. And what I'd like to discuss today is the need to overhaul and simplify the law to release the energy and passion of Americans  so that we can begin to address the challenges of our society. You might have noticed that law has grown progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two. If you run a business  it's hard to do much of anything without calling your general counsel. Indeed  there is this phenomenon now where the general counsels are becoming the CEOs. It's a little bit like the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. You need a lawyer to run the company  because there's so much law. But it's not just business that's affected by this  it's actually pressed down into the daily activities of ordinary people. A couple of years ago I was hiking near Cody  Wyoming. It was in a grizzly bear preserve  although no one told me that before we went. And our guide was a local science teacher. She was wholly unconcerned about the bears  but she was terrified of lawyers. The stories started pouring out. She'd just been involved in an episode where a parent had threatened to sue the school because she lowered the grade of the student by    percent when he turned the paper in late. The principal didn't want to stand up to the parent because he didn't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings. So  she had to go to meeting after meeting  same arguments made over and over again. After    days of sleepless nights  she finally capitulated and raised the grade. She said   Life's too short  I just can't keep going with this.  About the same time  she was going to take two students to a leadership conference in Laramie  which is a couple of hours away  and she was going to drive them in her car  but the school said   No  you can't drive them in the car for liability reasons. You have to go in a school bus.  So  they provided a bus that held    people and drove the three of them back and forth several hours to Laramie. Her husband is also a science teacher  and he takes his biology class on a hike in the nearby national park. But he was told he couldn't go on the hike this year because one of the students in the class was disabled  so the other    students didn't get to go on the hike either. At the end of this day I could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher. Now  we've been taught to believe that law is the foundation of freedom. But somehow or another  in the last couple of decades  the land of the free has become a legal minefield. It's really changed our lives in ways that are sort of imperceptible  and yet  when you pull back  you see it all the time. It's changed the way we talk. I was talking to a pediatrician friend in North Carolina. He said   Well you know  I don't deal with patients the same way anymore. You wouldn't want to say something off the cuff that might be used against you.  This is a doctor  whose life is caring for people. My own law firm has a list of questions that I'm not allowed to ask when interviewing candidates  such as the sinister question  bulging with hidden motives and innuendo   Where are you from   Now for    years  tort reformers have been sounding the alarm that lawsuits are out of control. And we read every once in while about these crazy lawsuits  like the guy in the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for    million dollars because they lost his pair of pants. The case went on for two years  I think he's still appealing the case. But the reality is  these crazy cases are relatively rare. They don't usually win. And the total of direct tort cost in this country is about two percent  which is twice as much as in other countries but  as taxes go  hardly crippling. But the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg. What's happened here  again  almost without our knowing  is our culture has changed. People no longer feel free to act on their best judgment. So  what do we do about it  We certainly don't want to give up the rights  when people do something wrong  to seek redress in the courts. We need regulation to make sure people don't pollute and such. We lack even a vocabulary to deal with this problem  and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference. We've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute  every issue  is a matter of kind of individual rights. And so we peer through a legal microscope  and look at everything. Is it possible that there are extenuating circumstances that explain why Johnny turned his paper in late in Cody  Wyoming  Is it possible that the doctor might have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker  And of course the hindsight bias is perfect. There's always a different scenario that you can sketch out where it's possible that something could have been done differently. And yet  we've been trained to squint into this legal microscope  hoping that we can judge any dispute against the standard of a perfect society  where everyone will agree what's fair  and where accidents will be extinct  risk will be no more. Of course  this is Utopia  it's a formula for paralysis  not freedom. It's not the basis of the rule of law  it's not the basis of a free society. So  now I have the first of four propositions I'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law  You've got to judge law mainly by its effect on the broader society  not individual disputes. Absolutely vital. So  let's pull back from the anecdotes for a second and look at our society from high above. Is it working  What does the macro data show us  Well  the healthcare system has been transformed  a culture pervaded with defensiveness  universal distrust of the system of justice  universal practice of defensive medicine. It's very hard to measure because there are mixed motives. Doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes  and also they no longer even know what's right or wrong. But reliable estimates range between    billion and     billion dollars per year. That's enough to provide care to all the people in America who don't have it. The trial lawyers say   Well  this legal fear makes doctors practice better medicine.  Well that's been studied too  by the Institute of Medicine and others. Turns out that's not the case. The fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up   Are you sure that's the right dosage   Because they're not sure  and they don't want to take legal responsibility. Let's go to schools. As we saw with the teacher in Cody  Wyoming  she seems to be affected by the law. Well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law. You could have a separate section of a law library around each of the following legal concepts  due process  special education  no child left behind  zero tolerance  work rules ... it goes on. We did a study of all the rules that affect one school in New York. The Board of Ed. had no idea. Tens of thousands of discreet rules     steps to suspend a student from school  It's a formula for paralysis. What's the effect of that  One is a decline in order. Again  studies have shown it's directly attributable to the rise of due process. Public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago where they found that    percent of the high school teachers in America say that they spend at least half of their time maintaining order in the classroom. That means those students are getting half the learning they're supposed to  because if one child is disrupting the class no one can learn. And what happens when the teacher tries to assert order  They're threatened with a legal claim. We also surveyed that. Seventy eight percent of the middle and high school teachers in America have been threatened by their students with violating their rights  with lawsuits by their students. They are threatening  their students. It's not that they usually sue  it's not that they would win  but it's an indication of the corrosion of authority. And how has this system of law worked for government  It doesn't seem to be working very well does it  Neither in Sacramento nor in Washington. The other day at the State of the Union speech  President Obama said  and I think we could all agree with this goal   From the first railroads to the interstate highway system  our nation has always been the first to compete. There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains.  Well  actually there is a reason  Environmental review has evolved into a process of no pebble left unturned for any major project taking the better part of a decade  then followed by years of litigation by anybody who doesn't like the project. Then  just staying above the Earth for one more second  people are acting like idiots  all across the country. Idiots. A couple of years ago  Broward County  Florida  banned running at recess. That means all the boys are going to be ADD. I mean it's just absolutely a formula for failure. My favorite  though  are all the warning labels.  Caution  Contents are hot   on billions of coffee cups. Archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years and they won't know about defensive medicine and stuff  but they'll see all these labels   Contents are extremely hot.  They'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac. That's the only explanation. Because why would you have to tell people that something was actually hot  My favorite warning was one on a five inch fishing lure. I grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing. Five inch fishing lure  it's a big fishing lure  with a three pronged hook in the back  and outside it said   Harmful if swallowed.  So  none of these people are doing what they think is right. And why not  They don't trust the law. Why don't they trust the law  Because it gives us the worst of both worlds  It's random    anybody can sue for almost anything and take it to a jury  not even an effort at consistency    and it's also too detailed. In the areas that are regulated  there are so many rules no human could possibly know it. Well how do you fix it  We could spend        lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle. But the challenge here is not one of just amending the law  because the hurdle for success is trust. People    for law to be the platform for freedom  people have to trust it. So  that's my second proposition  Trust is an essential condition to a free society. Life is complicated enough without legal fear. But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties  because it carries with it the power of state. And so the state can come in. It actually changes the way people think. It's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders all day long  whispering in your ear   Could that go wrong  Might that go wrong   It drives people from the smart part of the brain    that dark  deep well of the subconscious  where instincts and experience  and all the other factors of creativity and good judgment are    it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic. Pretty soon the doctor's saying   Well  I doubt if that headache could be a tumor  but who would protect me if it were  So maybe I'll just order the MRI.  Then you've wasted     billion dollars in unnecessary tests. If you make people self conscious about their judgments  studies show you will make them make worse judgments. If you tell the pianist to think about how she's hitting the notes when she's playing the piece  she can't play the piece. Self consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment. Edison stated it best. He said   Hell  we ain't got no rules around here  we're trying to accomplish something.  So  how do you restore trust  Tweaking the law's clearly not good enough  and tort reform  which is a great idea  lowers your cost if you're a businessperson  but it's like a Band Aid on this gaping wound of distrust. States with extensive tort reform still suffer all these pathologies. So  what's needed is not just to limit claims  but actually create a dry ground of freedom. It turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure. And it is this  Law sets boundaries  and on one side of those boundaries are all the things you can't do or must do    you can't steal  you've got to pay your taxes    but those same boundaries are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom. Isaiah Berlin put it this way   Law sets frontiers  not artificially drawn  within which men shall be inviolable.  We've forgotten that second part. Those dikes have burst. People wade through law all day long. So  what's needed now is to rebuild these boundaries. And it's especially important to rebuild them for lawsuits. Because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries for everybody else's freedom. If someone brings a lawsuit over   A kid fell off the seesaw   it doesn't matter what happens in the lawsuit  all the seesaws will disappear. Because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit. And that's what's happened. There are no seesaws  jungle gyms  merry go rounds  climbing ropes  nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four  because there's no risk associated with it. So  how do we rebuild it  Life is too complex for... Life is too complex for a software program. All these choices involve value judgments and social norms  not objective facts. And so here is the fourth proposition. This is what we have  the philosophy we have to change to. And there are two essential elements of it  We have to simplify the law. We have to migrate from all this complexity towards general principles and goals. The constitution is only    pages long. Worked pretty well for     years. Law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices. If they can't internalize it  they won't trust it. And how do you make it simple  Because life is complex  and here is the hardest and biggest change  We have to restore the authority to judges and officials to interpret and apply the law. We have to rehumanize the law. To make law simple so that you feel free  the people in charge have to be free to use their judgment to interpret and apply the law in accord with reasonable social norms. As you're going down  and walking down the sidewalk during the day  you have to think that if there is a dispute  there's somebody in society who sees it as their job to affirmatively protect you if you're acting reasonably. That person doesn't exist today. This is the hardest hurdle. It's actually not very hard. Ninety eight percent of cases  this is a piece of cake. Maybe you've got a claim in small claims court for your lost pair of pants for       but not in a court of general jurisdiction for millions of dollars. Case dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court. Takes five minutes. That's it  it's not that hard. But it's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand because we woke up in the     s to all these really bad values  racism  gender discrimination  pollution    they were bad values. And we wanted to create a legal system where no one could have bad values anymore. The problem is  we created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values. It doesn't mean that people in authority can do whatever they want. They're still bounded by legal goals and principles  The teacher is accountable to the principal  the judge is accountable to an appellate court  the president is accountable to voters. But the accountability's up the line judging the decision against the effect on everybody  not just on the disgruntled person. You can't run a society by the lowest common denominator. So  what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy. We can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy. We've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom. It's not true. Authority  in fact  is essential to freedom. Law is a human institution  responsibility is a human institution. If teachers don't have authority to run the classroom  to maintain order  everybody's learning suffers. If the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims  then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders. If the environmental agency can't decide that the power lines are good for the environment  then there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms to the city. A free society requires red lights and green lights  otherwise it soon descends into gridlock. That's what's happened to America. Look around. What the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices. It's the only way to get our freedom back  and it's the only way to release the energy and passion needed so that we can meet the challenges of our time. Thank you. Does anybody know when the stethoscope was invented  Any guesses      . And what I can say is  in       doctors aren't going to be walking around with stethoscopes. There's a whole lot better technology coming  and that's part of the change in medicine. What has changed our society has been wireless devices. But the future are digital medical wireless devices  OK  So  let me give you some examples of this to kind of make this much more concrete. This is the first one. This is an electrocardiogram. And  as a cardiologist  to think that you could see in real time a patient  an individual  anywhere in the world on your smartphone  watching your rhythm    that's incredible  and it's with us today. But that's just the beginning. You check your email while you're sitting here. In the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs  all your vital signs  your heart rhythm  your blood pressure  your oxygen  your temperature  etc. This is already available today. This is AirStrip Technologies. It's now wired    or I should say  wireless    by taking the aggregate of these signals in the hospital  in the intensive care unit  and putting it on a smartphone for physicians. If you're an expectant parent  what about the ability to monitor  continuously  fetal heart rate  or intrauterine contractions  and not having to worry so much that things are fine as the pregnancy  and moving over into the time of delivery  And then as we go further  today we have continuous glucose sensors. Right now  they are under the skin  but in the future  they won't have to be implanted. And of course  the desired range    trying to keep glucose between    and less than      checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor    you'll see how that can impact diabetes. And what about sleep  We're going to zoom in on that a little bit. We're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep. What if  on your phone  which will be available in the next few weeks  you had every minute of your sleep displayed  And this is  of course  as you can see  the awake is the orange. The REM sleep  rapid eye movement  dream state  is in light green  and light is gray  light sleep  and deep sleep  the best restorative sleep  is that dark green. How about counting every calorie  And this is ability  in real time  to actually take measurements of caloric intake as well as expenditure  through a Band Aid. Now  what I've talked about are physiologic metrics. But what I want to get to  the next frontier  very quickly  and why the stethoscope is on its way out  is because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds  and the breath sounds  because now  introduced by G.E. is a handheld ultra sound. Why is this important  Because this is so much more sensitive. Here is an example of an abdominal ultrasound  and also a cardiac echo  which can be sent wireless  and then there's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone. So  we're not just talking about physiologic metrics    the key measurements of vital signs  and all those things in physiology    but also all the imaging that one could look at in your smartphone. Now  this is an example of another obsolete technology  soon to be buried  the Holter Monitor. Twenty four hour recording  lots of wires. This is now a little tiny patch. You can put it on for two weeks and send it in the mail. Now  how does this work  Well  there is these smart Band Aids or these sensors that one would put on  on a shoe or on the wrist. And this sends a signal and it creates a body area network to a gateway. Gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway  as today many of these things are dedicated gateways  because they are not so well integrated. That signal goes to the web  the cloud  and then it can be processed and sent anywhere  to a caregiver  to a physician  back to the patient  etc. So  that's basically very simplistic technology of how this works. Now  I have this device on. I didn't want to take my shirt off to show you  but I can tell you it's on. This is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm  as you saw already  but it also goes well beyond that. This is me now. And you can see the ECG. Below that's the actual heart rate and the trend  to the right of that is a bioconductant. That's the fluid status  fluid status  that's really important if you're monitoring somebody with heart failure. And below that's temperature  and respiration  and oxygen  and then the position activity. So  this is really striking  because this device measures seven things that are very much vital signs for monitoring someone with heart failure. OK  And why is this important  Well  this is the most expensive bed. What if we could reduce the need for hospital beds  Well  we can. First of all  heart failure is the number one reason for hospital admissions and readmissions in this country. The cost of heart failure is    billion dollars a year  which is    percent related to hospitalization. And in the course of    days after a hospital stay for a Medicare greater than    years or older  is       percent are readmitted in    days  and by six months  over    percent are readmitted. So  can we improve that  Well the idea is we take this device that I'm wearing  and we put it on     patients with heart failure  randomly assigned  versus     patients who don't have active monitoring  and see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions  and that's exciting. And we'll start that trial  and you'll hear more about how we're going to do that  but that's a type of wireless device trial that could change medicine in the years ahead. Why now  Why has this all of a sudden become a reality  an exciting direction in the future of medicine  What we have is  in a way  a perfect positive storm. This sets up consumer driven healthcare. That's where this is all starting. Let me just give you specifics about why this is a big movement if you're not aware of it   .  million Americans have gotten a Nike shoe  which is a body area network that connects the shoe  the sole of the shoe to the iPhone  or an iPod. And this Wired Magazine cover article really captured a lot of this  it talked a lot about the Nike shoe and how quickly that's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology and energy expenditure. Here are some things  the principles that are guiding principles to keep in mind   A data driven health revolution promises to make us all better  faster  and stronger. Living by numbers.  And this one  which is really telling  this was from July  this cover article   The personal metrics movement goes way beyond diet and exercise. It's about tracking every facet of life  from sleep to mood to pain          .  Well  I tried this device. A lot of you have gotten that Phillips Direct Life. I didn't have one of those  but I got the Fitbit. That looks like this. It's like a wireless accelerometer  pedometer. And I want to just give you the results of that testing  because I wanted to understand about the consumer movement. I hope the  by the way  the Phillips Direct Life works better    I hope so. But this monitors food  it monitors activity and tracks weight. However you have to put in most of this stuff. The only thing it really tracks by itself is activity  and even then  it's not complete. So  you exercise and it picks up the exercise. You put in your height and weight  it calculates BMI  and of course it tells you how many calories you're expending from the exercise  and how many you took in  if you go in and enter all the foods. But it really wants you to enter all your activity. And so I went to this  and of course I was gratified that it picked up the    minutes of exercise  elliptical exercise I did  but then it wants more information. So  it says   You want to log sexual activity. How long did you do it for   And it says   How hard was it   Furthermore it says   Start time.  Now  this doesn't appear    this just doesn't work  I mean  this just doesn't work. So  now I want to move to sleep. Who would ever have thought you could have your own EEG at your home  tagged to a very nice alarm clock  by the way  This is the headband that goes with this alarm clock. It monitors your brainwaves continuously  when you're sleeping. So  I did this thing for seven days getting ready for TEDMed. This is an important part of our life  one third you're supposed to be sleeping. Of course how many here have any problems with sleeping  It's usually    percent. So  you tell me you sleep better than expected. Okay  well this was a week of my life in sleeping  and you get a Z.Q. score. Instead of an I.Q. score  you get a Z.Q. score when you wake up. You say   Oh  OK.  And a Z.Q. score is adjusted to age  and you want to get as high as you possibly can. So this is the moment by moment  or minute by minute sleep. And you see that Z.Q. there was    odd. And the wake time is in orange. And this can be a problem  as I learned. Because it not only helps you with quantifying your sleep  but also tells others you're awake. So  when my wife came in and she could tell you're awake.  Eric  I want to talk. I want to talk.  And I'm trying to play possum. This thing is very  very impressive. OK. So  that's the first night. And this one is now     and that's not a good score. And this tells you  of course  how much you had in REM sleep  in deep sleep  and all this sort of thing. This was really fascinating because this gave that quantitation about all the different phases of sleep. So  it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group. It's like a managed competition of sleep. And really interesting stuff. Look at this thing and say   Well  I didn't think I was a very good sleeper  but actually I did better than average in    to    year olds.  OK  And the key thing was  what I didn't know  was that I was a really good dreamer. OK. Now let's move from sleep to diseases. Eighty percent of Americans have chronic disease  or    percent of age greater than    have two or more chronic disease      million Americans have one or more chronic disease  and    percent of our  .   whatever  trillion expenditures are related to chronic disease. Now  diabetes is one of the big ones. Almost    million people have diabetes. And here is the latest map. It was published just a little more than a week ago in the New York Times  and it isn't looking good. That is  for men     percent in the country over    have Type II diabetes  and women  although it's less  it's terribly high. But of course we have a way to measure that now on a continuous basis  with a sensor that detects blood glucose  and it's important because we could detect hyperglycemia that otherwise wouldn't be known  and also hypoglycemia. And you can see the red dots  in this particular patient's case  were finger sticks  which would have missed both ends. But by continuous monitoring  it captures all that vital information. The future of this though  is being able to move this to a Band Aid type phenomenon  and that's not so far away. So  let me just give you  very quickly     top targets for wireless medicine. All these things are possible    some of them are very close  or already  as you heard  are available today  in some way or form. Alzheimer's disease  there's five million people affected  and you can check vital signs  activity  balance. Asthma  large number  we could detect things like pollen count  air quality  respiratory rate. Breast cancer  I'll show you an example of that real quickly. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Depression  there's a great approach to that in mood disorders. Diabetes I've just mentioned. Heart failure we already talked about. Hypertension     million people could have continuous blood pressure monitoring to come up with much better management and prevention. And obesity we already talked about  the ways to get to that. And sleep disorders. This is effective around the world. The access to smartphones and cell phones today is extraordinary. And this article from The Economist summed it up beautifully about the opportunities in health across the developing world   Mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people  more quickly  than any previous technology.  And that's before we got going on the m health world. Aging  The problem is enormous          broken hips per year  but the solutions are extraordinary  and they include so many different things. One of the ones I just wanted to mention  The iShoe is another example of a sensor that improves proprioception among the elderly to prevent falling. One of many different techniques using wireless sensors. So  we can change medicine across the continuum of care  across the ages from premies or unborn children to seniors  the pharmaceutical arena changes  the full spectrum of disease    I hope I've given you a sense of that    across the globe. There are two things that can really accelerate this whole process. One of them    we're very fortunate    is to develop a dedicated institute and that's work that started with the work that Scripps with Qualcomm ... and then the great fortune of meeting up with Gary and Mary West  to get behind this wireless health institute. San Diego is an extraordinary place for this. There's over     wireless companies      of which or more are working in wireless health. It's the number one source of commerce  and interestingly it dovetails beautifully with over     life science companies. The wireless institute  the West Wireless Health Institute  is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people who are here this evening  Gary and Mary West. And I'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this. Their fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible  and this is really a nonprofit education center which is just about to open. It looks like this  this whole building dedicated. And what it's trying to do is accelerate this era  to take unmet medical needs  to work and innovate    and we just appointed the chief engineer  Mehran Mehregany  it was announced on Monday    then to move up with development  clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice  the most challenging thing of all  requiring attention to reimbursement  healthcare policy  healthcare economics. The other big thing  besides having this fantastic institute to catalyze this process is guidance  and that's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital. If we understand biology from genomics and omics and wireless through physiologic phenotyping  that's big. Because what it does is allow a convergence like we've never had before. Over    major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level  but this is quite extraordinary  More has been learned about the underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years than in the history of man. And when you put that together with  for example  now an app for the iPhone with your genotype to guide drug therapy ... but  the future    we can now tell who's going to get Type II diabetes from all the common variants  and that's going to get filled in more with low frequency variants in the future. We can tell who's going to get breast cancer from the various genes. We can also know who's likely to get atrial fibrillation. And finally  another example  sudden cardiac death. Each of these has a sensor. We can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it. We can prevent  or have the earliest detection possible  for breast cancer with an ultrasound device given to the patient. An iPatch  iRhythm  for atrial fibrillation. And vital signs monitoring to prevent sudden cardiac death. We lose         people a year in the U.S. from sudden cardiac death. So  I hope I've convinced you of this  of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive across all these different diseases and more. It's really taking individualized medicine to a new height and it's hyper innovative  and I think it represents the black swan of medicine. Thanks for your attention. I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is. Autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe    the child remains non verbal    all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers. And I actually feel at home here  because there's a lot of autism genetics here. You wouldn't have any... It's a continuum of traits. When does a nerd turn into Asperger  which is just mild autism  I mean  Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today. And one of the things that is really going to concern me is getting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent the next energy things  you know  that Bill Gates talked about this morning. OK. Now  if you want to understand autism  animals. And I want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking. You have to get away from verbal language. I think in pictures  I don't think in language. Now  the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details. OK  this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters  or pick out the little letters  and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly. And the thing is  the normal brain ignores the details. Well  if you're building a bridge  details are pretty important because it will fall down if you ignore the details. And one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract. People are getting away from doing hands on stuff. I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands on classes  because art  and classes like that  those are the classes where I excelled. In my work with cattle  I noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice would make the cattle balk. Like  for example  this flag waving  right in front of the veterinary facility. This feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility  all they needed to do was move the flag. Rapid movement  contrast. In the early '  s when I started  I got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing. People thought that was crazy. A coat on a fence would make them balk  shadows would make them balk  a hose on the floor ... people weren't noticing these things    a chain hanging down    and that's shown very  very nicely in the movie. In fact  I loved the movie  how they duplicated all my projects. That's the geek side. My drawings got to star in the movie too. And actually it's called  Temple Grandin   not  Thinking In Pictures.  So  what is thinking in pictures  It's literally movies in your head. My mind works like Google for images. Now  when I was a young kid I didn't know my thinking was different. I thought everybody thought in pictures. And then when I did my book   Thinking In Pictures   I start interviewing people about how they think. And I was shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different. Like if I say   Think about a church steeple  most people get this sort of generalized generic one. Now  maybe that's not true in this room  but it's going to be true in a lot of different places. I see only specific pictures. They flash up into my memory  just like Google for pictures. And in the movie  they've got a great scene in there where the word  shoe  is said  and a whole bunch of '  s and '  s shoes pop into my imagination. OK  there is my childhood church  that's specific. There's some more  Fort Collins. OK  how about famous ones  And they just kind of come up  kind of like this. Just really quickly  like Google for pictures. And they come up one at a time  and then I think   OK  well maybe we can have it snow  or we can have a thunderstorm   and I can hold it there and turn them into videos. Now  visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle handling facilities. And I've worked really hard on improving how cattle are treated at the slaughter plant. I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides. I've got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it. But  one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind  just like a virtual reality computer system. And this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie. That was like just so super cool. And there were a lot of kind of Asperger types and autism types working out there on the movie set too. But one of the things that really worries me is  Where's the younger version of those kids going today  They're not ending up in Silicon Valley  where they belong. Now  one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social  is I had to sell my work  and not myself. And the way I sold livestock jobs is I showed off my drawings  I showed off pictures of things. Another thing that helped me as a little kid is  boy  in the '  s  you were taught manners. You were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves in the store and throw it around. Now  when kids get to be in third or fourth grade  you might see that this kid's going to be a visual thinker  drawing in perspective. Now  I want to emphasize that not every autistic kid is going to be a visual thinker. Now  I had this brain scan done several years ago  and I used to joke around about having a gigantic Internet trunk line going deep into my visual cortex. This is tensor imaging. And my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the control's. The red lines there are me  and the blue lines are the sex and age matched control. And there I got a gigantic one  and the control over there  the blue one  has got a really small one. And some of the research now is showing is that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex. Now  the thing is  the visual thinker's just one kind of mind. You see  the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind    good at one thing  bad at something else. And where I was bad was algebra. And I was never allowed to take geometry or trig. Gigantic mistake  I'm finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra  go right to geometry and trig. Now  another kind of mind is the pattern thinker. More abstract. These are your engineers  your computer programmers. Now  this is pattern thinking. That praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper    no scotch tape  no cuts. And there in the background is the pattern for folding it. Here are the types of thinking  photo realistic visual thinkers  like me  pattern thinkers  music and math minds. Some of these oftentimes have problems with reading. You also will see these kind of problems with kids that are dyslexic. You'll see these different kinds of minds. And then there's a verbal mind  they know every fact about everything. Now  another thing is the sensory issues. I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face. And I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it  and they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin. But sensory is an issue. Some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights  others have problems with sound sensitivity. You know  it's going to be variable. Now  visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind. Because think about it  An animal is a sensory based thinker  not verbal    thinks in pictures  thinks in sounds  thinks in smells. Think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant. He knows who's been there  when they were there. Are they friend or foe  Is there anybody he can go mate with  There's a ton of information on that fire hydrant. It's all very detailed information  and  looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals. Now  the animal mind  and also my mind  puts sensory based information into categories. Man on a horse and a man on the ground    that is viewed as two totally different things. You could have a horse that's been abused by a rider. They'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with the horseshoer  but you can't ride him. You have another horse  where maybe the horseshoer beat him up and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground  with the veterinarian  but a person can ride him. Cattle are the same way. Man on a horse  a man on foot    they're two different things. You see  it's a different picture. See  I want you to think about just how specific this is. Now  this ability to put information into categories  I find a lot of people are not very good at this. When I'm out troubleshooting equipment or problems with something in a plant  they don't seem to be able to figure out   Do I have a training people issue  Or do I have something wrong with the equipment   In other words  categorize equipment problem from a people problem. I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that. Now  let's say I figure out it's an equipment problem. Is it a minor problem  with something simple I can fix  Or is the whole design of the system wrong  People have a hard time figuring that out. Let's just look at something like  you know  solving problems with making airlines safer. Yeah  I'm a million mile flier. I do lots and lots of flying  and if I was at the FAA  what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of  It would be their airplane tails. You know  five fatal wrecks in the last    years  the tail either came off or steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way. It's tails  pure and simple. And when the pilots walk around the plane  guess what  They can't see that stuff inside the tail. You know  now as I think about that  I'm pulling up all of that specific information. It's specific. See  my thinking's bottom up. I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle. Now  here is a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats. He'd been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat. White cowboy hats  that was absolutely fine. Now  the thing is  the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together. We've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds. And one of the things that is driving me really crazy  as I travel around and I do autism meetings  is I'm seeing a lot of smart  geeky  nerdy kids  and they just aren't very social  and nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science. And this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher. My science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie. I was a goofball student. When I was in high school I just didn't care at all about studying  until I had Mr. Carlock's science class. He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie. And he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room. This brings up the whole thing of you've got to show kids interesting stuff. You know  one of the things that I think maybe TED ought to do is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on TED  and there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet to get these kids turned on. Because I'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids  and the teachers out in the Midwest  and the other parts of the country  when you get away from these tech areas  they don't know what to do with these kids. And they're not going down the right path. The thing is  you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind  or your mind can be wired to be more social. And what some of the research now has shown in autism is there may by extra wiring back here  in the really brilliant mind  and we lose a few social circuits here. It's kind of a trade off between thinking and social. And then you can get into the point where it's so severe you're going to have a person that's going to be non verbal. In the normal human mind language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals. This is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller. And he studied Alzheimer's patients that had frontal temporal lobe dementia. And the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain  and then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars. Now  Van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics  but I think it's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this eddy pattern in this painting followed a statistical model of turbulence  which brings up the whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head. And the Wolfram stuff    I was taking notes and I was writing down all the search words I could use  because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures. We've got to show these kids interesting stuff. And they've taken out the autoshop class and the drafting class and the art class. I mean art was my best subject in school. We've got to think about all these different kinds of minds  and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds  because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future. And let's talk about jobs. OK  my science teacher got me studying because I was a goofball that didn't want to study. But you know what  I was getting work experience. I'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven't learned basic things  like how to be on time. I was taught that when I was eight years old. You know  how to have table manners at granny's Sunday party. I was taught that when I was very  very young. And when I was     I had a job at a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes. I did internships in college  I was building things  and I also had to learn how to do assignments. You know  all I wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when I was little. My mother said   Well let's do a picture of something else.  They've got to learn how to do something else. Let's say the kid is fixated on Legos. Let's get him working on building different things. The thing about the autistic mind is it tends to be fixated. Like if a kid loves racecars  let's use racecars for math. Let's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance. In other words  use that fixation in order to motivate that kid  that's one of the things we need to do. I really get fed up when they  you know  the teachers  especially when you get away from this part of the country  they don't know what to do with these smart kids. It just drives me crazy. What can visual thinkers do when they grow up  They can do graphic design  all kinds of stuff with computers  photography  industrial design. The pattern thinkers  they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians  your software engineers  your computer programmers  all of those kinds of jobs. And then you've got the word minds. They make great journalists  and they also make really  really good stage actors. Because the thing about being autistic is  I had to learn social skills like being in a play. It's just kind of    you just have to learn it. And we need to be working with these students. And this brings up mentors. You know  my science teacher was not an accredited teacher. He was a NASA space scientist. Now  some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology  or a degree in chemistry  you can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry. We need to be doing that. Because what I'm observing is the good teachers  for a lot of these kids  are out in the community colleges  but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools. Another thing that can be very  very  very successful is there is a lot of people that may have retired from working in the software industry  and they can teach your kid. And it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old  because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark. You're getting that kid turned on. And you get him turned on  then he'll learn all the new stuff. Mentors are just essential. I cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me. And we've got to mentor them  hire them. And if you bring them in for internships in your companies  the thing about the autism  Asperger y kind of mind  you've got to give them a specific task. Don't just say   Design new software.  You've got to tell them something a lot more specific   Well  we're designing a software for a phone and it has to do some specific thing. And it can only use so much memory.  That's the kind of specificity you need. Well  that's the end of my talk. And I just want to thank everybody for coming. It was great to be here. Oh  you've got a question for me  OK. Chris Anderson  Thank you so much for that. You know  you once wrote  I like this quote   If by some magic  autism had been eradicated from the face of the Earth  then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave.  Temple Grandin  Because who do you think made the first stone spears  The Asperger guy. And if you were to get rid of all the autism genetics there would be no more Silicon Valley  and the energy crisis would not be solved. CA  So  I want to ask you a couple other questions  and if any of these feel inappropriate  it's okay just to say   Next question.  But if there is someone here who has an autistic child  or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them  what advice would you give them  TG  Well  first of all  you've got to look at age. If you have a two  three or four year old you know  no speech  no social interaction  I can't emphasize enough  Don't wait  you need at least    hours a week of one to one teaching. You know  the thing is  autism comes in different degrees. There's going to be about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn to talk  and they're not going to be working Silicon Valley  that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do. But then you get the smart  geeky kids that have a touch of autism  and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things. I got social interaction through shared interest. I rode horses with other kids  I made model rockets with other kids  did electronics lab with other kids  and in the '  s  it was gluing mirrors onto a rubber membrane on a speaker to make a light show. That was like  we considered that super cool. CA  Is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them  as some might  as most  wish  TG  Well let me tell you  that child will be loyal  and if your house is burning down  they're going to get you out of it. CA  Wow. So  most people  if you ask them what are they most passionate about  they'd say things like   My kids  or  My lover.  What are you most passionate about  TG  I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place. When I have a mother of an autistic child say   My kid went to college because of your book  or one of your lectures   that makes me happy. You know  the slaughter plants  I've worked with them in the '  s  they were absolutely awful. I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes  How many cattle fell down  How many cattle got poked with the prodder  How many cattle are mooing their heads off  And it's very  very simple. You directly observe a few simple things. It's worked really well. I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world. We need a lot more of that  and a lot less abstract stuff. CA  When we were talking on the phone  one of the things you said that really astonished me was you said one thing you were passionate about was server farms. Tell me about that. TG  Well the reason why I got really excited when I read about that  it contains knowledge. It's libraries. And to me  knowledge is something that is extremely valuable. So  maybe  over    years ago now our library got flooded. And this is before the Internet got really big. And I was really upset about all the books being wrecked  because it was knowledge being destroyed. And server farms  or data centers are great libraries of knowledge. CA  Temple  can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at TED. TG  Well thank you so much. Thank you. If you are a blind child in India  you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news. The first bad news is that the chances of getting treatment are extremely slim to none  and that's because most of the blindness alleviation programs in the country are focused on adults  and there are very  very few hospitals that are actually equipped to treat children. In fact  if you were to be treated  you might well end up being treated by a person who has no medical credentials as this case from Rajasthan illustrates. This is a three year old orphan girl who had cataracts. So  her caretakers took her to the village medicine man  and instead of suggesting to the caretakers that the girl be taken to a hospital  the person decided to burn her abdomen with red hot iron bars to drive out the demons. The second piece of bad news will be delivered to you by neuroscientists  who will tell you that if you are older than four or five years of age  that even if you have your eye corrected  the chances of your brain learning how to see are very  very slim    again  slim or none. So when I heard these two things  it troubled me deeply  both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons. So let me first start with the personal reason. It'll sound corny  but it's sincere. That's my son  Darius. As a new father  I have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate babies are  what our obligations are towards them and how much love we can feel towards a child. I would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for Darius  and for me to be told that there might be other Dariuses who are not getting treatment  that's just viscerally wrong. So that's the personal reason. Scientific reason is that this notion from neuroscience of critical periods    that if the brain is older than four or five years of age  it loses its ability to learn    that doesn't sit well with me  because I don't think that idea has been tested adequately. The birth of the idea is from David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's work  two researchers who were at Harvard  and they got the Nobel Prize in      for their studies of visual physiology  which are remarkably beautiful studies  but I believe some of their work has been extrapolated into the human domain prematurely. So  they did their work with kittens  with different kinds of deprivation regiments  and those studies  which date back to the '  s  are now being applied to human children. So I felt that I needed to do two things. One  provide care to children who are currently being deprived of treatment. That's the humanitarian mission. And the scientific mission would be to test the limits of visual plasticity. And these two missions  as you can tell  thread together perfectly. One adds to the other  in fact  one would be impossible without the other. So  to implement these twin missions  a few years ago  I launched Project Prakash. Prakash  as many of you know  is the Sanskrit word for light  and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children  we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience. And the logo    even though it looks extremely Irish  it's actually derived from the Indian symbol of Diya  an earthen lamp. The Prakash  the overall effort has three components  outreach  to identify children in need of care  medical treatment  and in subsequent study. And I want to show you a short video clip that illustrates the first two components of this work. This is an outreach station conducted at a school for the blind. Pawan Sinha  So  because this is a school for the blind  many children have permanent conditions. That's a case of microphthalmos  which is malformed eyes  and that's a permanent condition  it cannot be treated. That's an extreme of micropthalmos called enophthalmos. But  every so often  we come across children who show some residual vision  and that is a very good sign that the condition might actually be treatable. So  after that screening  we bring the children to the hospital. That's the hospital we're working with in Delhi  the Schroff Charity Eye Hospital. It has a very well equipped pediatric ophthalmic center  which was made possible in part by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity. So  eating burgers actually helps. eye health in many children  and ... ... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash.  PS  So  as I zoom in to the eyes of this child  you will see the cause of his blindness. The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils are congenital cataracts  so opacities of the lens. In our eyes  the lens is clear  but in this child  the lens has become opaque  and therefore he can't see the world. So  the child is given treatment. You'll see shots of the eye. Here's the eye with the opaque lens  the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted. And here's the same child three weeks post operation  with the right eye open. Thank you. So  even from that little clip  you can begin to get the sense that recovery is possible  and we have now provided treatment to over     children  and the story repeats itself. After treatment  the child gains significant functionality. In fact  the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation. We did a paper a few years ago about this woman that you see on the right  SRD  and she got her sight late in life  and her vision is remarkable at this age. I should add a tragic postscript to this    she died two years ago in a bus accident. So  hers is just a truly inspiring story    unknown  but inspiring story. So when we started finding these results  as you might imagine  it created quite a bit of stir in the scientific and the popular press. Here's an article in Nature that profiled this work  and another one in Time. So  we were fairly convinced    we are convinced    that recovery is feasible  despite extended visual deprivation. The next obvious question to ask  What is the process of recovery  So  the way we study that is  let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity. The child is provided treatment  and I want to stress that the treatment is completely unconditional  there is no quid pro quo. We treat many more children then we actually work with. Every child who needs treatment is treated. After treatment  about every week  we run the child on a battery of simple visual tests in order to see how their visual skills are coming on line. And we try to do this for as long as possible. This arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up. What might be the causal connections between the early developing skills and the later developing ones  And we've used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies  but I want to highlight one particular one  and that is image parsing into objects. So  any image of the kind that you see on the left  be it a real image or a synthetic image  it's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column  regions of different colors  different luminances. The brain has this complex task of putting together  integrating  subsets of these regions into something that's more meaningful  into what we would consider to be objects  as you see on the right. And nobody knows how this integration happens  and that's the question we asked with Project Prakash. So  here's what happens very soon after the onset of sight. Here's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago  and you see Ethan Myers  a graduate student from MIT  running the experiment with him. His visual motor coordination is quite poor  but you get a general sense of what are the regions that he's trying to trace out. If you show him real world images  if you show others like him real world images  they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over fragmented  it's made up of a collage  a patchwork  of regions of different colors and luminances. And that's what's indicated in the green outlines. When you ask them   Even if you can't name the objects  just point to where the objects are   these are the regions that they point to. So the world is this complex patchwork of regions. Even the shadow on the ball becomes its own object. Interestingly enough  you give them a few months  and this is what happens. Doctor  How many are these  Patient  These are two things. Doctor  What are their shapes  Patient  Their shapes ... This one is a circle  and this is a square. PS  A very dramatic transformation has come about. And the question is  What underlies this transformation  It's a profound question  and what's even more amazing is how simple the answer is. The answer lies in motion and that's what I want to show you in the next clip. Doctor  What shape do you see here  Patient  I can't make it out. Doctor  Now  Patient  Triangle. Doctor  How many things are these  Now  how many things are these  Patient  Two. Doctor  What are these things  Patient  A square and a circle. PS  And we see this pattern over and over again. The one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information. So the inference we are deriving from this  and several such experiments  is that dynamic information processing  or motion processing  serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing  it leads to visual integration and eventually to recognition. This simple idea has far reaching implications. And let me just quickly mention two  one  drawing from the domain of engineering  and one from the clinic. So  from the perspective of engineering  we can ask  Goven that we know that motion is so important for the human visual system  can we use this as a recipe for constructing machine based vision systems that can learn on their own  that don't need to be programmed by a human programmer  And that's what we're trying to do. I'm at MIT  at MIT you need to apply whatever basic knowledge you gain. So we are creating Dylan  which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive  and autonomously discovering  What are the objects in this visual input  So  don't worry about the internals of Dylan. Here  I'm just going to talk about how we test Dylan. The way we test Dylan is by giving it inputs  as I said  of the same kind that a baby  or a child in Project Prakash would get. But for a long time we couldn't quite figure out  Wow can we get these kinds of video inputs  So  I thought  could we have Darius serve as our babycam carrier  and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan  So that's what we did. I had to have long conversations with my wife. In fact  Pam  if you're watching this  please forgive me. So  we modified the optics of the camera in order to mimic the baby's visual acuity. As some of you might know  babyies are born pretty much legally blind. Their acuity    our acuity is        babies' acuity is like         so they are looking at the world in a very  very blurry fashion. Here's what a baby cam video looks like. Thankfully  there isn't any audio to go with this. What's amazing is that working with such highly degraded input  the baby  very quickly  is able to discover meaning in such input. But then two or three days afterward  babies begin to pay attention to their mother's or their father's face. How does that happen  We want Dylan to be able to do that  and using this mantra of motion  Dylan actually can do that. So  given that kind of video input  with just about six or seven minutes worth of video  Dylan can begin to extract patterns that include faces. So  it's an important demonstration of the power of motion. The clinical implication  it comes from the domain of autism. Visual integration has been associated with autism by several researchers. When we saw that  we asked  Could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath  of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism  Because  if that hypothesis were to be true  it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of what's causing the many different aspects of the autism phenotype. What you're going to see are video clips of two children    one neurotypical  one with autism  playing Pong. So  while the child is playing Pong  we are tracking where they're looking. In red are the eye movement traces. This is the neurotypical child  and what you see is that the child is able to make cues of the dynamic information to predict where the ball is going to go. Even before the ball gets to a place  the child is already looking there. Contrast this with a child with autism playing the same game. Instead of anticipating  the child always follows where the ball has been. The efficiency of the use of dynamic information seems to be significantly compromised in autism. So we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we'll have more results to report soon. Looking ahead  if you think of this disk as representing all of the children we've treated so far  this is the magnitude of the problem. The red dots are the children we have not treated. So  there are many  many more children who need to be treated  and in order to expand the scope of the project  we are planning on launching The Prakash Center for Children  which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital  a school for the children we are treating and also a cutting edge research facility. The Prakash Center will integrate health care  education and research in a way that truly creates the whole to be greater than the sum of the parts. So  to summarize  Prakash  in its five years of existence  it's had an impact in multiple areas  ranging from basic neuroscience plasticity and learning in the brain  to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism  the development of autonomous machine vision systems  education of the undergraduate and graduate students  and most importantly in the alleviation of childhood blindness. And for my students and I  it's been just a phenomenal experience because we have gotten to do interesting research  while at the same time helping the many children that we have worked with. Thank you very much. I think it was in my second grade that I was caught drawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo. I was sent straight away to my school principal  and my school principal  a sweet nun  looked at my book with disgust  flipped through the pages  saw all the nudes    you know  I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I'd copy her    and the nun slapped me on my face and said   Sweet Jesus  this kid has already begun.  I had no clue what she was talking about  but it was convincing enough for me never to draw again until the ninth grade. Thanks to a really boring lecture  I started caricaturing my teachers in school. And  you know  I got a lot of popularity. I don't play sports. I'm really bad at sports. I don't have the fanciest gadgets at home. I'm not on top of the class. So for me  cartooning gave me a sense of identity. I got popular  but I was scared I'd get caught again. So what I did was I quickly put together a collage of all the teachers I had drawn  glorified my school principal  put him right on top  and gifted it to him. He had a good laugh at the other teachers and put it up on the notice board. This is a part of that. And I became a school hero. All my seniors knew me. I felt really special. I have to tell you a little bit about my family. That's my mother. I love her to bits. She's the one who taught me how to draw and  more importantly  how to love. She's a bit of a hippie. She said   Don't say that   but I'm saying it anyway. The rest of my family are boring academics  busy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car. My father's a little different. My father believed in a holistic approach to living  and  you know  every time he taught us  he'd say   I hate these books  because these books are hijacked by Industrial Revolution.  While he still held that worldview  I was     I got the best lawyer in town  my older brother Karthik  and I sat him down  and I said   Pa  from today onwards I've decided I'm going to be disciplined  I'm going to be curious  I'm going to learn something new every day  I'm going to be very hard working  and I'm not going to depend on you emotionally or financially.  And he was very impressed. He was all tearing up. Ready to hug me. And I said   Hold that thought.  I said   Can I quit school then   But  to cut a long story short  I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist. I must have done about        caricatures. I would do birthday parties  weddings  divorces  anything for anyone who wanted to use my services. But  most importantly  while I was traveling  I taught children cartooning  and in exchange  I learned how to be spontaneous. And mad and crazy and fun. When I started teaching them  I said let me start doing this professionally. When I was    I started my own school. However  an    year old trying to start a school is not easy unless you have a big patron or a big supporter. So I was flipping through the pages of the Times of India when I saw that the Prime Minister of India was visiting my home town  Bangalore. And  you know  just like how every cartoonist knows Bush here  and if you had to meet Bush  it would be the funnest thing because his face was a cartoonist's delight. I had to meet my Prime Minister. I went to the place where his helicopter was about to land. I saw layers of security. I caricatured my way through three layers by just impressing the guards  but I got stuck. I got stuck at the third. And what happened was  to my luck  I saw a nuclear scientist at whose party I had done cartoons. I ran up to him  and said   Hello  sir. How do you do   He said   What are you doing here  Raghava   I said   I'm here to meet the Prime Minister.  He said   Oh  so am I.  I hopped into his car  and off we went through the remaining layers of security. Thank you. I sat him down  I caricatured him  and since then I've caricatured hundreds of celebrities. This is one I remember fondly. Salman Rushdie was pissed off I think because I altered the map of New York  if you notice. Anyway  the next slide I'm about to show you    Should I just turn that off  The next slide I'm about to show you  is a little more serious. I was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published soon after     . What was  for me  a very naive observation  turned out to be a disaster. That evening  I came home to hundreds of hate mails  hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this. I was also asked to leave the organization  a cartoonists' organization in America  that for me was my lifeline. That's when I realized  you know  cartoons are really powerful  art comes with responsibility. Anyway  what I did was I decided that I need to take a break. I quit my job at the papers  I closed my school  and I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks  and I decided to go traveling. When I went traveling  I remember  I met this fabulous old man  who I met when I was caricaturing  who turned out to be an artist  in Italy. He invited me to his studio. He said   Come and visit.  When I went  I saw the ghastliest thing ever. I saw this dead  naked effigy of himself hanging from the ceiling. I said   Oh  my God. What is that   And I asked him  and he said   Oh  that thing  In the night  I die. In the morning  I am born again.  I thought he was koo koo  but something about that really stuck. I loved it. I thought there was something really beautiful about that. So I said   I am dead  so I need to be born again.  So  I wanted to be a painter like him  except  I don't know how to paint. So  I tried going to the art store. You know  there are a hundred types of brushes. Forget it  they will confuse you even if you know how to draw. So I decided  I'm going to learn to paint by myself. I'm going to show you a very quick clip to show you how I painted and a little bit about my city  Bangalore. They had to be larger than life. Everything had to be larger. The next painting was even bigger. And even bigger. And for me it was  I had to dance while I painted. It was so exciting. Except  I even started painting dancers. Here for example is a Flamenco dancer  except there was one problem. I didn't know the dance form  so I started following them  and I made some money  sold my paintings and would rush off to France or Spain and work with them. That's Pepe Linares  the renowned Flamenco singer. But I had one problem  my paintings never danced. As much energy as I put into them while making them  they never danced. So I decided    I had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning. I called my friends  painted on their bodies  and had them dance in front of a painting. And  all of a sudden  my paintings came alive. And then I was fortunate enough to actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus. And I sat like you guys there in the audience. And I saw my work come alive. You know  normally you work in isolation  and you show at a gallery  but here  the work was coming alive  and it had some other artists working with me. The collaborative effort was fabulous. I said  I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet. I started doing fashion. This is a fashion show we held in London. The best collaboration  of course  is with children. They are ruthless  they are honest  but they're full of energy and fun. This is a work  a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation. And I must say  I spent time in the Bronx working with these kids. And  in exchange for me working with them  they taught me how to be cool. I don't think I've succeeded  but they've taught me. They said   Stop saying sorry. Say  my bad.  Then I said  all this is good  but I want to paint like a real painter. American education is so expensive. I was in India  and I was walking down the streets  and I saw a billboard painter. And these guys paint humongous paintings  and they look really good. And I wondered how they did it from so close. So  one day I had the opportunity to meet one of these guys  and I said   How do you paint like that  Who taught you   And he said   Oh  it's very easy. I can teach you  but we're leaving the city  because billboard painters are a dying  extinct bunch of artists  because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them.  I said  in exchange for education in how to paint  I will support them  and I started a company. And since then  I've been painting all over the place. This is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment. This is another painting. And  in fact  I started painting on anything  and started sending them around town. Since I mentioned my wife  the most important collaboration has been with her  Netra. Netra and I met when she was   . I must have been    and a half then  and it was love at first sight. I lived in India. She lived in America. She'd come every two months to visit me  and then I said I'm the man  I'm the man  and I have to reciprocate. I have to travel seven oceans  and I have to come and see you. I did that twice  and I went broke. So then I said   Nets  what do I do   She said   Why don't you send me your paintings  My dad knows a bunch of rich guys. We'll try and con them into buying it  and then...  But it turned out  after I sent the works to her  that her dad's friends  like most of you  are geeks. I'm joking. No  they were really big geeks  and they didn't know much about art. So Netra was stuck with    paintings of mine. So what we did was we rented a little van and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it. She contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work. She made enough money  she sold off the whole collection and made enough money to move me for four years with lawyers  a company  everything  and she became my manager. That's us in New York. Notice one thing  we're equal here. Something happened along the line. But this brought me    with Netra managing my career    it brought me a lot of success. I was really happy. I thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar. I loved the attention. This is all the press we got  and we said  it's time to celebrate. And I said that the best way to celebrate is to marry Netra. I said   Let's get married.  And I said   Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us  all the people who bought our work.  And you won't believe it  we put together a list of       people  who had made a difference    a ridiculous list  but I was determined to bring them to India  so    a lot of them were in India.     artists volunteered to help me with my wedding. We had fashion designers  installation artists  models  we had makeup artists  jewelry designers  all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation. And I had a special installation in tribute to my in laws. I had the vegetable carvers work on that for me. But all this excitement led to the press writing about us. We were in the papers  we're still in the news three years later  but  unfortunately  something tragic happened right after. My mother fell very ill. I love my mother and I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die. And they said you have to say bye to her  you have to do what you have to do. And I was devastated. I had shows booked up for another year. I was on a high. And I couldn't. I could not. My life was not exuberant. I could not live this larger than life person. I started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind. Of course  my work turned ugly  but another thing happened. I lost all my audiences. The Bollywood stars who I would party with and buy my work disappeared. The collectors  the friends  the press  everyone said   Nice  but thank you.   No thank you   was more like it. But I wanted people to actually feel my work from their gut  because I was painting it from my gut. If they wanted beauty  I said  this is the beauty I'm willing to give you. It's politicized. Of course  none of them liked it. My works also turned autobiographical. At this point  something else happened. A very  very dear friend of mine came out of the closet  and in India at that time  it was illegal to be gay  and it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person. I was very upset. I remember the time when my mother used to dress me up as a little girl    that's me there    because she wanted a girl  and she has only boys. Anyway  I don't know what my friends are going to say after this talk. It's a secret. So  after this  my works turned a little violent. I talked about this masculinity that one need not perform. And I talked about the weakness of male sexuality. This time  not only did my collectors disappear  the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to forbid me from showing. It turned nasty  and I'm a bit of a chicken. I can't deal with any threat. This was a big threat. So  I decided it was time to end and go back home. This time I said let's try something different. I need to be reborn again. And I thought the best way  as most of you know who have children  the best way to have a new lease on life  is to have a child. I decided to have a child  and before I did that  I quickly studied what can go wrong. How can a family get dysfunctional  And Rudra was born. That's my little son. And two magical things happened after he was born. My mother miraculously recovered after a serious operation  and this man was elected president of this country. You know I sat at home and I watched. I teared up and I said that's where I want to be. So Netra and I wound up our life  closed up everything we had  and we decided to move to New York. And this was just eight months ago. I moved back to New York  my work has changed. Everything about my work has become more whimsical. This one is called  What the Fuck Was I Thinking   It talks about mental incest. You know  I may appear to be a very nice  clean  sweet boy. But I'm not. I'm capable of thinking anything. But I'm very civil in my action  I assure you. These are just different cartoons. And  before I go  I want to tell you a little story. I was talking to mother and father this morning  and my dad said   I know you have so much you want to say  but you have to talk about your work with children.  So I said  okay. I work with children all over the world  and that's an entirely different talk  but I want to leave you with one story that really  really inspired me. I met Belinda when she was   . I was   . I was in Australia  and Belinda had cancer  and I was told she's not going to live very long. They  in fact  told me three weeks. I walk into her room  and there was a shy girl  and she was bald  and she was trying to hide her baldness. I whipped out my pen  and I started drawing on her head and I drew a crown for her. And then  we started talking  and we spent a lovely time    I told her how I ended up in Australia  how I backpacked and who I conned  and how I got a ticket  and all the stories. And I drew it out for her. And then I left. Belinda died and within a few days of her death  they published a book for her  and she used my cartoon on the cover. And she wrote a little note  she said   Hey Rags  thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world.  For me  my art is my magic carpet ride. I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride  and touch children and be honest. Thank you so much. Everybody talks about happiness these days. I had somebody count the number of books with  happiness  in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about     and there were many more. There is a huge wave of interest in happiness  among researchers. There is a lot of happiness coaching. Everybody would like to make people happier. But in spite of all this flood of work  there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness. And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps. This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness  and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness  because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is. The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity. It turns out that the word  happiness  is just not a useful word anymore  because we apply it to too many different things. I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it  but by and large  this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well being is. The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory  basically  it's between being happy in your life  and being happy about your life or happy with your life. And those are two very different concepts  and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness. And the third is the focusing illusion  and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects well being without distorting its importance. I mean  this is a real cognitive trap. There's just no way of getting it right. Now  I'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures reported a story  and that was a story    He said he'd been listening to a symphony  and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording  there was a dreadful screeching sound. And then he added  really quite emotionally  it ruined the whole experience. But it hadn't. What it had ruined were the memories of the experience. He had had the experience. He had had    minutes of glorious music. They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory  the memory was ruined  and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep. What this is telling us  really  is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves. There is an experiencing self  who lives in the present and knows the present  is capable of re living the past  but basically it has only the present. It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches    you know  when the doctor asks   Does it hurt now when I touch you here   And then there is a remembering self  and the remembering self is the one that keeps score  and maintains the story of our life  and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question   How have you been feeling lately   or  How was your trip to Albania   or something like that. Those are two very different entities  the experiencing self and the remembering self  and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness. Now  the remembering self is a storyteller. And that really starts with a basic response of our memories    it starts immediately. We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories. Our memory tells us stories  that is  what we get to keep from our experiences is a story. And let me begin with one example. This is an old study. Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure. I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days  but it was painful when this study was run in the     s. They were asked to report on their pain every    seconds. Here are two patients  those are their recordings. And you are asked   Who of them suffered more   And it's a very easy question. Clearly  Patient B suffered more    his colonoscopy was longer  and every minute of pain that Patient A had  Patient B had  and more. But now there is another question   How much did these patients think they suffered   And here is a surprise. The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B. The stories of the colonoscopies were different  and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends. And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great    but one of them is this distinct ...  Laughter  but one of them is distinctly worse than the other. And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end  it's a bad story. How do we know that  Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy  and much later  too   How bad was the whole thing  in total   And it was much worse for A than for B  in memory. Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self. From the point of view of the experiencing self  clearly  B had a worse time. Now  what you could do with Patient A  and we actually ran clinical experiments  and it has been done  and it does work    you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much. That will cause the patient to suffer  but just a little and much less than before. And if you do that for a couple of minutes  you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off  and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off  because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience. What defines a story  And that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us  and it's also true of the stories that we make up. What defines a story are changes  significant moments and endings. Endings are very  very important and  in this case  the ending dominated. Now  the experiencing self lives its life continuously. It has moments of experience  one after the other. And you can ask  What happens to these moments  And the answer is really straightforward  They are lost forever. I mean  most of the moments of our life    and I calculated  you know  the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long  that means that  you know  in a life there are about     million of them  in a month  there are about            most of them don't leave a trace. Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self. And yet  somehow you get the sense that they should count  that what happens during these moments of experience is our life. It's the finite resource that we're spending while we're on this earth. And how to spend it would seem to be relevant  but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us. So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self  and they're really quite distinct. The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time. From the point of view of the experiencing self  if you have a vacation  and the second week is just as good as the first  then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation. That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self. For the remembering self  a two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added. You have not changed the story. And in this way  time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self  time has very little impact on the story. Now  the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories. It is actually the one that makes decisions because  if you have a patient who has had  say  two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose  then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad  and that's the surgeon that will be chosen. The experiencing self has no voice in this choice. We actually don't choose between experiences  we choose between memories of experiences. And even when we think about the future  we don't think of our future normally as experiences. We think of our future as anticipated memories. And basically you can look at this  you know  as a tyranny of the remembering self  and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't need. I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case  that is  we go on vacations  to a very large extent  in the service of our remembering self. And this is a bit hard to justify I think. I mean  how much do we consume our memories  That is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self. And when I think about that  I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago  which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had  and I think of it relatively often  relative to how much I think of other vacations. And I probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip  I would say  for about    minutes in the last four years. Now  if I had ever opened the folder with the     pictures in it  I would have spent another hour. Now  that is three weeks  and that is at most an hour and a half. There seems to be a discrepancy. Now  I may be a bit extreme  you know  in how little appetite I have for consuming memories  but even if you do more of this  there is a genuine question  Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences  So I want you to think about a thought experiment. Imagine that for your next vacation  you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed  and you'll get an amnesic drug so that you won't remember anything. Now  would you choose the same vacation   Laughter  And if you would choose a different vacation  there is a conflict between your two selves  and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict  and it's actually not at all obvious  because if you think in terms of time  then you get one answer  and if you think in terms of memories  you might get another answer. Why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves. Now  the two selves bring up two notions of happiness. There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply  one per self. So you can ask  How happy is the experiencing self  And then you would ask  How happy are the moments in the experiencing self's life  And they're all    happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process. What are the emotions that can be measured  And  by the way  now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time. If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self  it's a completely different thing. This is not about how happily a person lives. It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life. Very different notion. Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness  and I belong to a crowd of students of well being  who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way. The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years  and there are now efforts to measure the two separately. The Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences  and there have been other efforts along those lines. So in recent years  we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves. And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different. You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life  and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life  and vice versa. Just to give you a sense of the correlation  the correlation is about . . What that means is if you met somebody  and you were told   Oh his father is six feet tall   how much would you know about his height  Well  you would know something about his height  but there's a lot of uncertainty. You have that much uncertainty. If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten  you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self. So the correlation is low. We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self. We know that money is very important  goals are very important. We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like  spending time with people that we like. There are other pleasures  but this is dominant. So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves  you are going to end up doing very different things. The bottom line of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being. It is a completely different notion. Now  very quickly  another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life  and we actually live. So  if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California  you are not going to get to the correct answer. When you ask that question  you think people must be happier in California if  say  you live in Ohio. And what happens is when you think about living in California  you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places  and that contrast  say  is in climate. Well  it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are. But now  because the reflective self is in charge  you may end up    some people may end up moving to California. And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier. Well  their experiencing self is not going to get happier. We know that. But one thing will happen  They will think they are happier  because  when they think about it  they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio  and they will feel they made the right decision. It is very difficult to think straight about well being  and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. I've got a question for you. Thank you so much. Now  when we were on the phone a few weeks ago  you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey. Is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now  Daniel Kahneman  Sure. I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number  which we absolutely did not expect to find. We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self. When we looked at how feelings  vary with income. And it turns out that  below an income of        dollars a year  for Americans    and that's a very large sample of Americans  like          so it's a large representative sample    below an income of         dollars a year... CA        . DK        .        dollars a year  people are unhappy  and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get. Above that  we get an absolutely flat line. I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat. Clearly  what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness  but lack of money certainly buys you misery  and we can measure that misery very  very clearly. In terms of the other self  the remembering self  you get a different story. The more money you earn  the more satisfied you are. That does not hold for emotions. CA  But Danny  the whole American endeavor is about life  liberty  the pursuit of happiness. If people took seriously that finding  I mean  it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about  like for example  taxation policy and so forth. Is there any chance that politicians  that the country generally  would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it  DK  You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy. The recognition is going to be slow in the United States  no question about that  but in the U.K.  it is happening  and in other countries it is happening. People are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy. It's going to take a while  and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness  or whether they want to study life evaluation  so we need to have that debate fairly soon. How to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think  and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self. This is going to influence policy  I think  in years to come. In the United States  efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population. This is going to be  I think  within the next decade or two  part of national statistics. CA  Well  it seems to me that this issue will    or at least should be    the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years. Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics. Thank you  Danny Kahneman. So  what I'm going to do is just give you the latest episode of India's    maybe the world's    longest running soap opera  which is cricket. And may it run forever  because it gives people like me a living. It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want  It's got love  joy  happiness  sadness  tears  laughter  lots of deceit  intrigue. And like all good soaps  it jumps    years when the audience interest changes. And that's exactly what cricket has done. It's jumped    years into    over game. And that's what I'm going to talk about  how a small change leads to a very big revolution. But it wasn't always like that. Cricket wasn't always this speed driven generations game. There was a time when you played cricket  you played timeless test matches  when you played on till the game got over. And there was this game in March      that started on the third of March and ended on the   th of March. And it only ended because the English cricketers had to go from Durban to Cape Town  which is a two hour train journey  to catch the ship that left on the   th  because the next ship wasn't around for a long time. So  the match was ended in between. And one of the English batsmen said   You know what  Another half an hour and we would have won.  Another half an hour after    days. There were two Sundays in between. But of course  Sundays are church days  so you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained  so they all sat around making friends with each other. But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket  because we had about the same pace of life. The Mahabharata was like that as well  wasn't it  You fought by day  then it was sunset  so everyone went back home. And then you worked out your strategy  and you came and fought the next day  and you went back home again. The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket  everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day. Princes patronize the game  not because they love the game  but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers. But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket  which was  all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball  and any number of people could play it anywhere. Take a look  You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there  you could play it in a little alley    you couldn't hit square anywhere  because the bat hit the wall  don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires. You could play it on the banks of the Ganges    that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time. Or you could play many games in one small patch of land  even if you didn't know which game you were actually in. As you can see  you can play anywhere. But slowly the game moved on  you know  finally. You don't always have five days. So  we moved on  and we started playing    over cricket. And then an enormous accident took place. In Indian sport we don't make things happen  accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time  sometimes. And we won this World Cup in     . And suddenly we fell in love with the    over game  and we played it virtually every day. There was more    over cricket than anywhere. But there was another big date.      was when we won the World Cup.      '    we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India  rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country. And so we allowed multinationals into India. We cut customs duties  we reduced import duties  and we got all the multinationals coming in  with multinational budgets  who looked at per capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India  and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian. And there are only two vehicles in India    one real  one scripted. The scripted one is what you see in the movies  the real one was cricket. And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me  Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi  decided he's going to take it all over the world. And Pepsi was this big revolution  because they started taking cricket all over. And so cricket started becoming big  cricket started bringing riches in. Television started covering cricket. For a long time television said   We won't cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it.  Then they said   OK  the next rights are sold for    million dollars. The next rights are sold for     million dollars.  So  it's a bit of a curve  that. And then another big accident happened in our cricket. England invented    overs cricket  and said   The world must play    overs cricket.  Just as England invented cricket  and made the rest of the world play it. Thank God for them. And so  India had to go and play the T   World Cup  you see. India didn't want to play the T   World Cup. But we were forced to play it by an     margin. And then something very dramatic happened. We got to the final  and then this moment  that will remain enshrined forever  for everybody  take a look. The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder. Announcer  And Zishan takes it  India wins  What a match for a Twenty   final. India  the world champions. India  T   champions. But what a game we had  M. S. Dhoni got it right in the air  but Misbah ul Haq  what a player. A massive  massive success  India  the world TT champions. Harsha Bhogle  Suddenly India discovered this power of    overs cricket. The accident  of course  there  was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast. If he had bowled fast  the ball would have gone where it was meant to go  but it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game. And what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world. It was at a time when investment was coming in  India was feeling a little more confident about itself. And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do. And thankfully for all of us  the English are very good at inventing things  and then the gracious people that they are  they let the world become very good at it. And so England invented T   cricket  and allowed India to hijack it. It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine  we just took it straight away  as is. And so  we launched our own T   league. Six weeks  city versus city. It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country    the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country  representing itself on the field. One was war  the Indian army  which we don't like to happen very often. The other was Indian cricket. Now  suddenly we had to support city leagues. But the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the West. America is a home of leagues. And they said   Right  we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India.  But was India ready for it  Because cricket  for a long time in India was always organized. It was never promoted  it was never sold    it was organized. And look what they did with our beautiful  nice  simple family game. All of a sudden  you had that happening. An opening ceremony to match every other. This was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar. This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand's population twice over. So  it was a different India. But it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern  but didn't want to say that to people. And so  they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived. Everyone secretly watched them  but everyone claimed not to. The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes. They were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn't actually love it  these were people who ran serious companies. And so they started promoting cricket big time  started promoting clubs big time. And they've started promoting them with huge money behind it. I mean the IPL had  .  billion dollars before a ball was bowled   .  billion dollars for television revenue over    years  and another    million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities  but they had to do it like the West  right  Because we are setting up leagues. But what they were very good at doing was making it very localized. So  just to give you an example of how they did it    not Manchester United style promotion  but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look. Of course  a lot of people said   Maybe they dance better than they play.  But that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket. All along  if you wanted a young cricketer  you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality  your own city  and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers. Now  all of the sudden  if you were to bowl a shot    if Mumbai were to bowl a shot  for example  they needn't go to Kalbadevi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them  they could go to Trinidad. This was the new India  wasn't it  This was the new world  where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price. And all of a sudden  Indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world. So  the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago  overnight. And when he had to go back to represent the West Indies  they asked him   When do you have to reach   He said   I have to be there by a certain time  so I have to leave today.  We said   No  no  no. It's not about when you have to leave  it's about when do you have to reach there   And so he said   I've got to reach on date X.  And they said   Fine  you play to date X  minus one.  So  he played in Hyderabad  went  straight after the game  went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport  sat in a private corporate jet    first refueling in Portugal  second refueling in Brazil  he was in West Indies in time. Never would India have thought on this scale before. Never would India have said   I want a player to play one game for me  and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to Kingston  Jamaica to play a game.  And I just thought to myself   Wow  we've arrived somewhere in the world  you know  We have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big.  But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket  which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment. There is cricket and the movies. And they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs. And so  people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta. They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan. And something very interesting happened. We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket. And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more. And of course  if you were on Preity Zinta's team    as you will see on the clip that follows    if you did well  you got a hug from Preity Zinta. So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look    everyone's watching Preity Zinta. And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd. We'd all seen matches in Kolkata  but we'd never seen anything like this  Shah Rukh  with the Bengali song  getting the audiences all worked up for Kolkata    not for India  but for Kolkata. But take a look at this. An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer because they'd won in Kolkata. Can you imagine  And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said   I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team.  But I thought I'd take this opportunity    there's a few people from Pakistan in here. I'm so happy that you're here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends  right  We can play cricket together  we can be friends. So thank you very much for coming  all of you from Pakistan. There was criticism too because they said   Players are being bought and sold  Are they grain  Are they cattle   Because we had this auction  you see. How do you fix a price for a player  And so the auction that followed literally had people saying   Bang  so many million dollars for so and so player.  There it is. Auctioneer  Going at           dollars. Chennai. Shane Warne sold for         dollars. HB  Suddenly  a game which earned its players    rupees a day    so     rupees for a test match  but if you finish in four days you only got    . The best Indian players who played every test match    every one of the internationals  the top of the line players    standard contracts are         dollars in a whole year. Now they were getting         for six days' work. Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England  he got one and a half million dollars  and he went back and said   For four weeks  I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard  and I'm earning more than the footballers  wow.  And where was he earning it from  From a little club in India. Could you have imagined that day would come  One and a half million dollars for six weeks' work. That's not bad  is it  So  at  .  billion dollars before the first ball was bowled. What India was doing  though  was benchmarking itself against the best in the world  and it became a huge brand. Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today. IPL became the biggest brand in India and  because our elections  had to be moved to South Africa  and we had to start the tournament in three weeks. Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks. But we did it. You know why  Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event  and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks. Our population  which for a long time we thought was a problem  suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching    the huge consuming class    everybody came to watch the cricket. We'd also made cricket the only sport in India  which is a pity  but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big  which is a bit of a tragedy of our times. Now  this last minute before I go    there's a couple of side effects of all this. For a long time  India was this country of poverty  dust  beggars  snake charmers  filth  Delhi belly    people heard Delhi belly stories before they came. And  all of a sudden  India was this land of opportunity. Cricketers all over the world said   You know  we love India. We love to play in India.  And that felt good  you know  We said   The dollar's quite powerful actually.  Can you imagine  you've got the dollar on view and there's no Delhi belly in there anymore. There's no filth  there's no beggars  all the snake charmers have vanished  everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules. Right so  finally  an English game that India usurped a little bit  but T   is going to be the next missionary in the world. If you want to take the game around the world  it's got to be the shortest form of the game. You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through    days with no result in the end  or you can't take it all over the world. So that's what T   is doing. Hopefully  it'll make everyone richer  hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business. Thank you very much. Thank you. If I can leave you with one big idea today  it's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts  and instead of thinking about information overload  what I'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible. So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age. This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment. It's called Pivot  and with Pivot what I can do is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths    say  accidents. And  right away  I see there's a different pattern that emerges. This is because  in the mid area here  people are at their most active  and over here they're at their most frail. We can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death  seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects  but not for everyone. If we go ahead and we filter by age    say    years or less    we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about. And if you drill into that  it's especially the case for men. So you get the idea that viewing information  viewing data in this way  is a lot like swimming in a living information info graphic. And if we can do this for raw data  why not do it for content as well  So what we have right here is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated ever produced. It's all here  it's all on the web. You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk. With Pivot  you can drill into a decade. You can drill into a particular year. You can jump right into a specific issue. So I'm looking at this  I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue  the sports. I'm a Lance Armstrong fan  so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that  which reveals  for me  all the issues in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of. Now  if I want to just kind of take a peek at these  I might think   Well  what about taking a look at all of cycling   So I can step back  and expand on that. And I see Greg LeMond now. And so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way    going narrower  broader  backing in  backing out    you're not searching  you're not browsing. You're doing something that's actually a little bit different. It's in between  and we think it changes the way information can be used. So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit crazy. What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary. So the summary consists of just a little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from. I'm only showing the top     most popular Wikipedia pages right here. But even in this limited view  we can do a lot of things. Right away  we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on Wikipedia. I'm going to go ahead and select government. Now  having selected government  I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year. So this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page. It's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them. Looking at one of these particular summaries  I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year  bringing up all of them. So looking at these people  I can see that the majority come from government  some have come from natural sciences  some  fewer still  have come from business    there's my boss    and one has come from music. And interestingly enough  Bono is also a TED Prize winner. So we can go  jump  and take a look at all the TED Prize winners. So you see  we're navigating the web for the first time as if it's actually a web  not from page to page  but at a higher level of abstraction. And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise. I'm just showing the New York Times website here. So Pivot  this application    I don't want to call it a browser  it's really not a browser  but you can view web pages with it    and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this. So I can step back  pop right back into a specific section. Now the reason why this is important is because  by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way  I can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way. So I can drill into what I've done over specific time frames. Here  in fact  is the state of all the demo that I just gave. And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today. And  if I want to step back and look at everything  I can slice and dice my history  perhaps by my search history    here  I was doing some nepotistic searching  looking for Bing  over here for Live Labs Pivot. And from these  I can drill into the web page and just launch them again. It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times  and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data. So right now  in this world  we think about data as being this curse. We talk about the curse of information overload. We talk about drowning in data. What if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down  so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next  we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things  and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden  If we can do that  then instead of being trapped in data  we might actually extract information. And  instead of dealing just with information  we can tease out knowledge. And if we get the knowledge  then maybe even there's wisdom to be found. So with that  I thank you. I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction. In high school  I took a bus to school an hour each way every day. And I was always absorbed in a book  science fiction book  which took my mind to other worlds  and satisfied  in a narrative form  this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had. And you know  that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school I was out in the woods  hiking and taking  samples     frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water    and bringing it back  looking at it under the microscope. You know  I was a real science geek. But it was all about trying to understand the world  understand the limits of possibility. And my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me  because what was happening  this was in the late '  s  we were going to the moon  we were exploring the deep oceans. Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined. So  that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it. And I was an artist. I could draw. I could paint. And I found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape  I had to create these images in my head. You know  we all did  as kids having to read a book  and through the author's description  put something on the movie screen in our heads. And so  my response to this was to paint  to draw alien creatures  alien worlds  robots  spaceships  all that stuff. I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook. That was    the creativity had to find its outlet somehow. And an interesting thing happened  The Jacques Cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth. I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday    that seemed pretty darn unlikely. But that was a world I could really go to  right here on Earth  that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books. So  I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of   . And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada      miles from the nearest ocean. But I didn't let that daunt me. I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo  New York  right across the border from where we live. And I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo  New York. And I didn't see the ocean  a real ocean  for another two years  until we moved to California. Since then  in the intervening    years  I've spent about       hours underwater  and     hours of that was in submersibles. And I've learned that that deep ocean environment  and even the shallow oceans  are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination. Nature's imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination. I still  to this day  stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives. And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing  and just as strong as it ever was. But when I chose a career as an adult  it was filmmaking. And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urges to create images. And I was  as a kid  constantly drawing comic books  and so on. So  filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together  and that made sense. And of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories   Terminator    Aliens  and  The Abyss.  And with  The Abyss   I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking. So  you know  merging the two passions. Something interesting came out of  The Abyss   which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film  which was to create this kind of liquid water creature  we actually embraced computer generated animation  CG. And this resulted in the first soft surface character  CG animation that was ever in a movie. And even though the film didn't make any money    barely broke even  I should say    I witnessed something amazing  which is that the audience  the global audience  was mesmerized by this apparent magic. You know  it's Arthur Clarke's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. They were seeing something magical. And so that got me very excited. And I thought   Wow  this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art.  So  with  Terminator     which was my next film  we took that much farther. Working with ILM  we created the liquid metal dude in that film. The success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work. And it did  and we created magic again  and we had the same result with an audience    although we did make a little more money on that one. So  drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to   This is going to be a whole new world   this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists. So  I started a company with Stan Winston  my good friend Stan Winston  who is the premier make up and creature designer at that time  and it was called Digital Domain. And the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on  and we would go right to digital production. And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while. But we found ourselves lagging in the mid '  s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do. So  I wrote this piece called  Avatar   which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects  of CG effects  beyond  with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG  and the main characters would all be in CG  and the world would be in CG. And the envelope pushed back  and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while. So  I shelved it  and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks. You know  I went and pitched it to the studio as  'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship   It's going to be this epic romance  passionate film.  Secretly  what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of  Titanic.  And that's why I made the movie. And that's the truth. Now  the studio didn't know that. But I convinced them. I said   We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real. We'll be using it in the opening of the film. It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook.  And I talked them into funding an expedition. Sounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality. Because we actually created a reality where six months later  I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic  looking at the real Titanic through a view port. Not a movie  not HD    for real. Now  that blew my mind. And it took a lot of preparation  we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things. But  it struck me how much this dive  these deep dives  was like a space mission. You know  where it was highly technical  and it required enormous planning. You get in this capsule  you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself. And I thought like   Wow. I'm like  living in a science fiction movie. This is really cool.  And so  I really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration. Of course  the curiosity  the science component of it    it was everything. It was adventure  it was curiosity  it was imagination. And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't give me. Because  you know  I could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing out that window. As we did some of our subsequent expeditions  I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before  sometimes things that no one had seen before  that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them. So  I was completely smitten by this  and had to do more. And so  I actually made a kind of curious decision. After the success of  Titanic   I said   OK  I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker  and I'm going to go be a full time explorer for a while.  And so  we started planning these expeditions. And we wound up going to the Bismark  and exploring it with robotic vehicles. We went back to the Titanic wreck. We took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic. And the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship  which had never been done. Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it  so we created technology to do it. So  you know  here I am now  on the deck of Titanic  sitting in a submersible  and looking out at planks that look much like this  where I knew that the band had played. And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship. When I say   I'm operating it   but my mind is in the vehicle. I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic. And it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I've ever had  because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it  because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie. And the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship. So  it was this absolutely remarkable experience. And it really made me realize that the telepresence experience    that you actually can have these robotic avatars  then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle  into this other form of existence. It was really  really quite profound. And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post human futures that I can imagine  as a science fiction fan. So  having done these expeditions  and really beginning to appreciate what was down there  such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing  amazing animals    they're basically aliens right here on Earth. They live in an environment of chemosynthesis. They don't survive on sunlight based system the way we do. And so  you're seeing animals that are living next to a     degree Centigrade water plumes. You think they can't possibly exist. At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well    again  it's the science fiction influence  as a kid. And I wound up getting involved with the space community  really involved with NASA  sitting on the NASA advisory board  planning actual space missions  going to Russia  going through the pre cosmonaut biomedical protocols  and all these sorts of things  to actually go and fly to the international space station with our  D camera systems. And this was fascinating. But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep. And taking them down so that they had access    astrobiologists  planetary scientists  people who were interested in these extreme environments    taking them down to the vents  and letting them see  and take samples and test instruments  and so on. So  here we were making documentary films  but actually doing science  and actually doing space science. I'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan  you know  as a kid  and doing this stuff for real. And you know  along the way in this journey of discovery  I learned a lot. I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot about leadership. Now you think director has got to be a leader  leader of  captain of the ship  and all that sort of thing. I didn't really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions. Because I had to  at a certain point  say   What am I doing out here  Why am I doing this  What do I get out of it   We don't make money at these damn shows. We barely break even. There is no fame in it. People sort of think I went away between  Titanic  and  Avatar  and was buffing my nails someplace  sitting at the beach. Made all these films  made all these documentary films for a very limited audience. No fame  no glory  no money. What are you doing  You're doing it for the task itself  for the challenge    and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is    for the thrill of discovery  and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team. Because we would do these things with        people  working for years at a time  sometimes at sea for two  three months at a time. And in that bond  you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you  that you've done a task that you can't explain to someone else. When you come back to the shore and you say   We had to do this  and the fiber optic  and the attentuation  and the this and the that  all the technology of it  and the difficulty  the human performance aspects of working at sea   you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that maybe cops have  or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it. Creates a bond  creates a bond of respect. So  when I came back to make my next movie  which was  Avatar   I tried to apply that same principle of leadership  which is that you respect your team  and you earn their respect in return. And it really changed the dynamic. So  here I was again with a small team  in uncharted territory  doing  Avatar   coming up with new technology that didn't exist before. Tremendously exciting. Tremendously challenging. And we became a family  over a four and half year period. And it completely changed how I do movies. So  people have commented on how   Well  you know  you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of Pandora.  To me  it was more of a fundamental way of doing business  the process itself  that changed as a result of that. So  what can we synthesize out of all this  You know  what are the lessons learned  Well  I think number one is curiosity. It's the most powerful thing you own. Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality. And the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world. I have young filmmakers come up to me and say   Give me some advice for doing this.  And I say   Don't put limitations on yourself. Other people will do that for you    don't do it to yourself  don't bet against yourself  and take risks.  NASA has this phrase that they like   Failure is not an option.  But failure has to be an option in art and in exploration  because it's a leap of faith. And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk. You have to be willing to take those risks. So  that's the thought I would leave you with  is that in whatever you're doing  failure is an option  but fear is not. Thank you. I'm Jon M. Chu. And I'm not a dancer  I'm not a choreographer    I'm actually a filmmaker  a storyteller. I directed a movie two years ago called  Step Up    The Streets.  Anybody  Anybody  Yeah  During that movie I got to meet a ton of hip hop dancers    amazing  the best in the world    and they brought me into a society  the sort of underground street culture that blew my mind. I mean  this is literally human beings with super human strength and abilities. They could fly in the air. They could bend their elbow all the way back. They could spin on their heads for    times in a row. I'd never seen anything like that. When I was growing up  my heroes were people like Fred Astaire  Gene Kelly  Michael Jackson. I grew up in a musical family. And those guys  those were like  ultimate heroes. Being a shy  little  skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valley with low self esteem  those guys made me believe in something bigger. Those guys made me want to  like   I'm going to do that moonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl.  And it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared  sort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos. But after seeing what I've seen  the truth is  they have not disappeared at all. They're here  getting better and better every day. And dance has progressed. It is insane what dance is right now. Dance has never had a better friend than technology. Online videos and social networking ... dancers have created a whole global laboratory online for dance  where kids in Japan are taking moves from a YouTube video created in Detroit  building on it within days and releasing a new video  while teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it with a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself. And this is happening every day. And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages  with cheap webcams  lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow. Our Fred Astaires  our Gene Kellys our Michael Jacksons are right at our fingertips  and may not have that opportunity  except for us. So  we created the LXD  sort of a    the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers  a justice league of dancers that believe that dance can have a transformative effect on the world. A living  breathing comic book series  but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man  these guys can actually do it. And we're going to show you some today. So  let me introduce to you  some of our heroes right now. We got Madd Chadd  Lil' C  Kid David and J Smooth. Please be excited  have fun  yell  scream. Ladies and gentlemen  The LXD. I get a lot of different reactions actually. Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it  but sometimes they get a little freaked out. And  I don't know  I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit. J Smooth  When I'm in the zone    I'm dancing and free styling it    I actually visually kind of picture lines  and moving them. I think of like  Transformers  like how panels open and then they fold  they fold in  and then you close that panel. And then another thing opens  you close that. Kid David  It's kind of like  honestly a lot of times I don't really know what's going on when I'm dancing. Because at that point it's just really like  it's my body and the music. It's not really a conscious decision   I'm going to do this next  I'm going to do this.  It's kind of like this other level where you can't make choices anymore  and it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music. I got my name just because I was so young. I was young when I started. I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing with. So  it was always like  they called me Kid David  because I was the kid. L'il C  I tell them to create a ball  and then you just use that ball of energy. And instead of throwing it out  people would think that's a krump move  that's a krump move. That's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out  you throw it out  and you hold it. And you let it go  and then right when you see the tail  you grab it by the tail  then you bring it back in. And you just got this piece of energy and you just  you're manipulating it. You know  you create power  then you tame it. I have a vision for each one of you  and the vision I have for you is that when you wake up in the morning  your blood is singing at the thought of being who you are and doing what you do  that as you go through the day  you can literally sink to your knees in gratitude at the tremendous good fortune that's been bestowed on you  that as you go through the day  you become radiantly alive several times. And if your life isn't like that  I'd like to humbly suggest that you're wasting your life. A life is too short to be wasted. So what I propose to do in the next    minutes    I've used up one minute already    is to give you a set of powerful tools which can get you started on being there. Is that of interest to you  Audience  Yes. Srikumar Rao  OK. This is a conference on happiness  but even if it wasn't a conference on happiness  would it be right if I said that in some way  shape  fashion or form  you're devoting your entire life to being happy  Everything you do    your job  family  children  relationships  whatever    is a quest for happiness. Correct  I'd like you to think about the following  What do you have to get in order to be happy  We're just going to spend a minute on this. What do you have to get in order to be happy  Anybody  quick  When I conduct this experiment  a bunch of stuff comes up  vast wealth  trophy spouse  good health  lots of travel  time  etc  etc  etc. Right now  if you were to think about it  you probably have a list of   Here's what I need to get in order to be happy.  I would like you to consider this  anything that you can get    let me repeat that    anything you can get  you can un get. Is that correct  So  vast wealth can make you happy. Vast wealth can disappear tomorrow. A number of people in the financial sector have discovered this already. So whatever you get that can make you happy can go away. Where does that leave you  Not a very nice place  right  I have a different proposition to suggest to you. What I have to suggest to you is that there is nothing that you have to get  do or be in order to be happy. Let me repeat that  there is nothing that you have to get  do or be in order to be happy. In fact  happiness is your innate nature. It is hardwired into you. It is part of your DNA. You cannot not be happy. Now  all of you are very polite  and in some of the other forums I speak in  such as top business schools  they're not so polite. And invariably  somebody articulates what many of you are thinking  which is   If happiness is my innate nature  how come I am not experiencing it  How come I am experiencing my life sucks   And the answer to that is actually very simple. You have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy. Let me repeat that  you have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy. And the way we learn to be unhappy is by buying into a particular mental model. A mental model is a notion we have that this is the way the world works. All of us have mental models  we've got dozens of mental models. We've got mental models on how to find a job  how to get ahead at work  how to pick a restaurant to eat at  how to have a movie to go to ... dozens of them. The problem isn't that we have mental models. The problem is that we don't know that we have mental models. We think this is the way the world works. And the more we invest in a mental model  the more it appears that this  in fact  is the way the world works. But it isn't  it's just a mental model  and the mental model we have that we buy into so strongly is that we have to get something so we can do something so we can be something. Like  we have to get a great deal of money so we can travel to exotic places so we can be happy. We have to be in a relationship so we can have great sex so we can be happy. All of this is a variation of the if then model. And the if then model is  if this happens  then we will be happy. If I were to get a better job  if I were to get more money  if my boss would have a heart attack  if only I was married  if only my wife would leave me    if only I had children  if my children would grow up and go to college ... It doesn't matter what it is. The whole notion is if this happens  then I will be happy. And right now  the only thing that's different between the persons in this audience is what is the particular  if  that you are focusing on  And the only thing that's different between you now and where you were    years ago is what is the particular  if  that you were focusing on  Think about your life    years ago. Spend a minute doing that. Ten years ago  if you remember clearly  there were certain things you wanted. Is that correct  Odds are pretty good that many of those things you wanted    years ago you now have. Is that correct  Where has that left you  In exactly the same place  right  What we don't realize is the model itself is flawed. The if then model     If this happens I will be happy     the model itself is flawed. But instead of recognizing that it is the model itself that's flawed  what we do is spend enormous amounts of time changing the  if.   Oh  well  I thought if I became CEO it would help  but now I realize it's not that I want to become a CEO. I want to become the billionaire CEO  and then I will be happy.  You've got your own variation on that. But it's the model itself that's flawed  not what you put on the  if  side of the equation. I can demonstrate that to you. Can any of you recall a time when you were confronted with a scene of such spectacular beauty that it took you outside of yourself into a place of great serenity  Maybe a rainbow  a mountain range  a valley  the sea. And if you remember that    raise your hands if you could. Virtually all of you could  right  Have you ever wondered why that happened  The reason that happened is that somehow  for some reason  at that instant  you accepted the universe exactly as it was. You didn't say   That's a beautiful rainbow  but it's kind of off to the left  and if I could move it     yards to the right  it would be ever so much more beautiful.  You didn't say   That's a beautiful valley  but the tree in the foreground has too many crooked branches. So if you gave me a chainsaw and    minutes  I'd make it ever so much better.  Oh no  the rainbow off center was just fine. The tree with its crooked branches was just fine. And the moment you accepted the universe just as it was  your habitual wanting self dropped away  and the happiness which is your innate nature surfaced  and you felt it. And I know you felt it because now  even now after all those years  you can still remember it. The problem is that your life right now  with all of the problems that you have    more precisely  all of the problems that you think you have    is equally perfect. But you do not accept it. In fact  you're spending all your time striving with might and main to make it different. You are not accepting it. And when you're not accepting it  you're buying into the if then model  if this happens  then I will be happy. And it's the model itself that is flawed. So let me show you how you can get out of that  or at least you can begin the steps towards getting out of that. I'd like to share with you that action. We all live our lives because we want to achieve something  correct  You know  we are here and we want to have something. Alex wants to have a successful conference. You know  many of you want to have great programs for your companies that are very successful. You want to progress  have more money  all of that  is that correct  Each of those is an outcome  you would like something to happen. Now  I'd like you to think about the following  actions are within your control  not entirely  but to a large extent. The outcome is completely out of your control. OK  Actions are within your control. The outcome is completely outside your control. Have any of you recognized that when you have a goal and you start to work towards it  some of the time you don't achieve your goal  and some of the time what you get is the exact opposite of what you wanted  Has that happened to any of you  Like there was a friend of mine who said   Gee  you know  I have not been paying a lot of attention to my wife  and this has to change.  So the next time we went on a business trip  he bought a very expensive dress for her. And this was his way of showing  you know  I care for you  and nice things would happen. And when he presented the gift to his wife  her immediate reaction was   After    years of marriage  you don't know my size    And furthermore  don't you know I never wear this kind of thing   And the next thing you know  he had a full blown marital spat. Has that happened to any of you  You've taken action for a particular outcome and the outcome you got was the exact opposite of what you wanted  Happens all the time. Well  we live in a world where what we think of  what we invest in  is the outcome. We define our life in the following way  here I am  here is where I want to go  these are the steps I have to take in order to get from where I am to where I want to go  and if I succeed  life is wonderful. And if I don't  then I have failed  life is no good  life sucks. True  False  That is how we live. We invest in the outcome  and as I've just pointed out  the outcome is frequently different from what we would like  and sometimes the diametric opposite of what we would like. You invest in the outcome and you are guaranteed to have more than your share of frustration  angst and all the rest of the stuff that makes life suck. There is an alternative. And the alternative is that you do not invest in the outcome  you invest in the process. And the best way to describe that is a quote by John Wooden. I don't know how many of you are familiar with John Wooden. He's very well known in the United States and certainly among basketball fans. He's the only person ever to make the basketball Hall of Fame both as a player and as a coach. And what he told his entering team    he led UCLA to an unprecedented number of victories and finals in the NCAA    and what he used to tell any new team is he never spoke about winning. He always said   When it's over and you look in the mirror  did you do the best that you were capable of  And if you did the best that you were capable of  the score doesn't matter. But I would suspect that if you did the best that you were capable of  you will find the score to your liking.  That is investing in a process. What we do is the exact opposite. We invest in the outcome. This is what I want    oh  I want it so desperately  because if I get it I will be happy. And you try with might and main  to do whatever you can  but you are always focusing on   This is the outcome.  Now  focusing on the outcome is fine. It gives you direction. Investing in the outcome means that you make the achievement of a particular outcome dependent for your well being. And that is a surefire recipe for failure. What you can do is something else. You can invest in the process. That is  once you have determined  here is where I am  here is where I want to be  and that's fine  you focus on the outcome only to the extent that it gives you direction  and then you invest yourself completely in the process. You say  here are the steps you want to take  and you put everything into it. And if you succeed  wonderful. And if you don't succeed  still wonderful  because now you have a new starting point  and from that new starting point  you select another outcome and keep going. And when you do that  you will find that every day is a blast. Let me give you an example. And if you have children    raise your hands if you have children. Have you ever seen a small child learn to walk  What happens  and this happens typically between    and    months  is the child gets up and she sees everybody walking  she wants to walk  she gets up  she falls down  she starts crying and momma runs up and comforts her  kisses the place  makes it well. She tries again  falls down  mommy runs up again. After some time  mommy feels tired and no longer runs up and the child stops crying  and then she gets up  takes a step and doesn't fall down  and then she takes another  and a beautiful smile comes on her face. And very soon  generally within    hours  she's walking all over the place  upsetting your living room arrangements. And you know you've gone to a new stage of parenting. Right  Now  imagine what would happen if each time the child fell  she would say   Oh my God  I failed again. I'm never going to learn to walk.  And you have to get counseling for her to help her deal with feelings of inadequacy and not being able to achieve and fail yet again. How long do you think it would take her to learn to walk if you had to do that  if every three times she fell down  you had to get a counselor to counsel her and so on  Sounds funny  doesn't it  But that is exactly what we're doing. What the child is doing is focusing on the process. She's investing in the process  not in the outcome. What we do is the exact opposite. As we grow up  we lose the ability to invest in the process  we start investing in the outcome. By definition the outcome is outside of our control  and if that's where we spend all of our emotional energy  we are going to get drained as we do. But if  on the other hand  we said   Here is the outcome  I am going to invest in the process and give it every single bit I could   every day is a blast  and you're well on your way to achieving the vision that I outlined to you. The question that I get all the time  is people say   Professor Rao  but nothing makes me passionate.  So I say   OK  what would   And they invariably come up with  you know  here is a list of things. Here's my job and here's how much it pays  this is the kind of person my boss is  the kind of people my colleagues are  and here's how my customers are  here's how much I travel  here's how big my office is  how deep the carpeting is  how many windows I have    a bunch of parameters. And what I tell them is what I want to share with you  because all of that stuff    first of all  it doesn't exist. But second  even if it did and you were plugged into it  it would not take more than six months for you to be the same sorry  miserable self there as you are now  because passion exists inside you. It does not exist in the job. And if you don't find a way to ignite it within you right where you are  you are not going to find it outside. But if you do find a way to ignite it where you are  then you will find that the external world rearranges itself to accommodate the new person that you are becoming. And as you do that  you will find that miracles happen on a regular basis. Persons come up whom you're delighted to meet. New people enter your life. It's just a breeze  because all you do in your life is you take journeys. You came here to this conference  you went on a journey. You hang around the water cooler  talking about how terrible your place of work is  you went on a journey. You watch  Desperate Housewives   you go on a journey. You go on a journey where    something women are having affairs with    something gardeners while the husbands are playing around with models. All you do is go on journeys. There's nothing wrong with that  but just ask yourself   Is this a journey I want to take  Does this take me to a place I want to spend time   And if you start doing that  you will find that your life changes. The kind of people you meet  the things you talk about  the movies you go to  the books you read    everything changes. And you begin all of that by focusing on the process. Invest in the process  not in the outcome. Thank you. Last year here at TED I asked you to give me your data  to put your data on the web  on the basis that if people put data onto the web    government data  scientific data  community data  whatever it is    it will be used by other people to do wonderful things  in ways that they never could have imagined. So  today I'm back just to show you a few things  to show you  in fact  there is an open data movement afoot  now  around the world. The cry of  Raw data now   which I made people make in the auditorium  was heard around the world. So  let's roll the video. A classic story  the first one which lots of people picked up  was when in March    on March   th in fact  soon after TED    Paul Clarke  in the U.K. government  blogged   Oh  I've just got some raw data. Here it is  it's about bicycle accidents.  Two days it took the Times Online to make a map  a mashable map    we call these things mash ups    a mashed up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected. Here's more data  traffic survey data  again  put out by the U.K. government  and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards  then a user could just make a map  just by clicking. Does this data affect things  Well  let's get back to     . Look at Zanesville  Ohio. Here's a map a lawyer made. He put on it the water plant  and which houses are there  which houses have been connected to the water. And he got  from other data sources  information to show which houses are occupied by white people. Well  there was too much of a correlation  he felt  between which houses were occupied by white people and which houses had water  and the judge was not impressed either. The judge was not impressed to the tune of   .  million dollars. That's the power of taking one piece of data  another piece of data  putting it together  and showing the result. Let's look at some data from the U.K. now. This is U.K. government data  a completely independent site  Where Does My Money Go. It allows anybody to go there and burrow down. You can burrow down by a particular type of spending  or you can go through all the different regions and compare them. So  that's happening in the U.K. with U.K. government data. Yes  certainly you can do it over here. Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in California. Take an arbitrary example  Long Beach  California  you can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending on different things such as energy. In fact  this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of data.gov  and data.gov.uk. And I'm delighted to see a great competition between the U.K. in blue  and the U.S. in red. How can you use this stuff  Well  for example  if you have lots of data about places you can take  from a postcode    which is like a zip plus four    for a specific group of houses  you can make paper  print off a paper which has got very  very specific things about the bus stops  the things specifically near you. On a larger scale  this is a mash up of the data which was released about the Afghan elections. It allows you to set your own criteria for what sort of things you want to look at. The red circles are polling stations  selected by your criteria. And then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors  like the threat level. So  that was government data. I also talked about community generated data    in fact I edited some. This is the wiki map  this is the Open Street Map.  Terrace Theater  I actually put on the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year. I was not the only person editing the open street map. Each flash on this visualization    put together by ITO World    shows an edit in      made to the Open Street Map. Let's now spin the world during the same year. Every flash is an edit. Somebody somewhere looking at the Open Street Map  and realizing it could be better. You can see Europe is ablaze with updates. Some places  perhaps not as much as they should be. Here focusing in on Haiti. The map of Port au Prince at the end of      was not all it could be  not as good as the map of California. Fortunately  just after the earthquake  GeoEye  a commercial company  released satellite imagery with a license  which allowed the open source community to use it. This is January  in time lapse  of people editing ... that's the earthquake. After the earthquake  immediately  people all over the world  mappers who wanted to help  and could  looked at that imagery  built the map  quickly building it up. We're focusing now on Port au Prince. The light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the  satellite images . So  now we have  immediately  a real time map showing where there are refugee camps    rapidly became the best map to use if you're doing relief work in Port au Prince. Witness the fact that it's here on this Garmin device being used by rescue team in Haiti. There's the map showing  on the left hand side  that hospital    actually that's a hospital ship. This is a real time map that shows blocked roads  damaged buildings  refugee camps    it shows things that are needed  for rescue and relief work . So  if you've been involved in that at all  I just wanted to say  Whatever you've been doing  whether you've just been chanting   Raw data now   or you've been putting government or scientific data online  I just wanted to take this opportunity to say  Thank you very much  and we have only just started  I only have three minutes so I'm going to have to talk fast  and it will use up your spare mental cycles  so multitasking may be hard. So     years ago I got a traffic ticket that got me thinking. I've had some time to think it over. And energy efficiency is more than just about the vehicle    it's also about the road. Road design makes a difference  particularly intersections  of which there are two types  signalized and unsignalized  which means stop signs. Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections. Roundabouts are much better. A study of    intersections has found crashes drop    percent from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout. Injury crashes have dropped    percent  fatal crashes down    percent. But that's just safety. What about time and gas  So  traffic keeps flowing  so that means less braking  which means less accelerating  less gas and less pollution  less time wasted  and that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency than we have in the United States. So  unsignalized intersections  meaning stop signs  they save many lives  but there's an excessive proliferation of them. Small roundabouts are starting to appear. This is one in my neighborhood. And they are much better    better than traffic lights  better than four way stop signs. They're expensive to install  but they are more expensive not to. So  we should look at that. But they are not applicable in all situations. So  take  for example  the three way intersection. So  it's logical that you'd have one there  on the minor road entering the major. But the other two are somewhat questionable. So  here's one. There's another one which I studied. Cars rarely appear on that third road. And so  the question is  what does that cost us  That intersection I looked at had about       cars per day in each direction  and so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of. That's five cents each  and times       cars per day  that's         per year. That's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution  wear on the car  and time. What's that time worth  Well  at    seconds per       cars  that's  .  hours per day. The average wage in the U.S. is     an hour. That is        per year. Add that together with the gas  and it's          per year  just for that sign in each direction. Discount that back to the present  at five percent  over two million dollars for a stop sign  in each direction. Now  if you look at what that adjacent property is worth  you could actually buy the property  cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line  and then sell it off again. And you'd still come out ahead. So  it makes one wonder   Why is it there   I mean  why is there that stop sign in each direction  Because it is saving lives. So  is there a better way to accomplish that goal  The answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road safely. Because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road. Can that be accomplished with existing signs  So  there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs. Stop signs were invented in       yield signs in     . But that's all we got. So  why not use a yield sign  Well the meaning of yield is  You must yield the right of way. That means that if there are five cars waiting  you have to wait till they all go  then you go. It lacks the notion of alternating  or taking turns  and it's always on the minor road  allowing the major one to have primacy. So  it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign. You couldn't suddenly tell everyone   OK  remember what you used to do at yield signs  Now do something different.  That would not work. So  what the world needs now is a new type of sign. So  you'd have a little instruction below it  you know  for those who didn't see the public service announcements. And it merges the stop sign and yield signs. It's kind of shaped like a T  as in taking turns. And uncertainty results in caution. When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with they slow down. So  now that you are all  Road Scholars  ... don't wait for that sign to be adopted  these things don't change quickly. But you all are members of communities  and you can exercise your community influence to create more sensible traffic flows. And you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much. So  I've known a lot of fish in my life. I've loved only two. That first one  it was more like a passionate affair. It was a beautiful fish  flavorful  textured  meaty  a bestseller on the menu. What a fish. Even better  it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability. So you could feel good about selling it. I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months. One day  the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm's sustainability.  Absolutely   I said. Here was a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs  How do we keep fish on our menus  For the past    years  we've been fishing the seas like we clear cut forests. It's hard to overstate the destruction. Ninety percent of large fish  the ones we love    the tunas  the halibuts  the salmons  swordfish    they've collapsed. There's almost nothing left. So  for better or for worse  aquaculture  fish farming  is going to be a part of our future. A lot of arguments against it  Fish farms pollute    most of them do anyway    and they're inefficient. Take tuna  a major drawback. It's got a feed conversion ratio of    to one. That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna. Not very sustainable. It doesn't taste very good either. So here  finally  was a company trying to do it right. I wanted to support them. The day before the event  I called the head of P.R. for the company. Let's call him Don.  Don   I said   just to get the facts straight  you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea  you don't pollute.   That's right   he said.  We're so far out  the waste from our fish gets distributed  not concentrated.  And then he added   We're basically a world unto ourselves. That feed conversion ratio   .  to one   he said.  Best in the business.   .  to one  great.   .  what  What are you feeding    Sustainable proteins   he said.  Great   I said. Got off the phone. And that night  I was lying in bed  and I thought  What the hell is a sustainable protein  So the next day  just before the event  I called Don. I said   Don  what are some examples of sustainable proteins   He said he didn't know. He would ask around. Well  I got on the phone with a few people in the company  no one could give me a straight answer until finally  I got on the phone with the head biologist. Let's call him Don too.  Don   I said   what are some examples of sustainable proteins   Well  he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals  and then he said chicken pellets. I said   Chicken pellets   He said   Yeah  feathers  skin  bone meal  scraps  dried and processed into feed.  I said   What percentage of your feed is chicken   Thinking  you know  two percent.  Well  it's about    percent   he said. I said   Don  what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish   There was a long pause on the line  and he said   There's just too much chicken in the world.  I fell out of love with this fish. No  not because I'm some self righteous  goody two shoes foodie. I actually am. No  I actually fell out of love with this fish because  I swear to God  after that conversation  the fish tasted like chicken. This second fish  it's a different kind of love story. It's the romantic kind  the kind where the more you get to know your fish  you love the fish. I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain. A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time. She kind of set us up. It came to the table a bright  almost shimmering  white color. The chef had overcooked it. Like twice over. Amazingly  it was still delicious. Who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked  I can't  but this guy can. Let's call him Miguel    actually his name is Miguel. And no  he didn't cook the fish  and he's not a chef  at least in the way that you and I understand it. He's a biologist at Veta La Palma. It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain. It's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river. Until the     s  the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians. They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands. They did it by draining the land. They built this intricate series of canals  and they pushed water off the land and out into the river. Well  they couldn't make it work  not economically. And ecologically  it was a disaster. It killed like    percent of the birds  which  for this place  is a lot of birds. And so in       a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land. What did they do  They reversed the flow of water. They literally flipped the switch. Instead of pushing water out  they used the channels to pull water back in. They flooded the canals. They created a        acre fish farm    bass  mullet  shrimp  eel    and in the process  Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction. The farm's incredible. I mean  you've never seen anything like this. You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away  and all you see are flooded canals and this thick  rich marshland. I was there not long ago with Miguel. He's an amazing guy  like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee. Okay  There we are slogging through the wetlands  and I'm panting and sweating  got mud up to my knees  and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture. Here  he's pointing out a rare Black shouldered Kite. Now  he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton. And here  here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe. It turns out  Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa. I asked him how he became such an expert on fish. He said   Fish  I didn't know anything about fish. I'm an expert in relationships.  And then he's off  launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants. And don't get me wrong  that was really fascinating  you know  the biotic community unplugged  kind of thing. It's great  but I was in love. And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before. So I interrupted him. I said   Miguel  what makes your fish taste so good   He pointed at the algae.  I know  dude  the algae  the phytoplankton  the relationships  It's amazing. But what are your fish eating  What's the feed conversion ratio   Well  he goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild. The plant biomass  the phytoplankton  the zooplankton  it's what feeds the fish. The system is so healthy  it's totally self renewing. There is no feed. Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals  Later that day  I was driving around this property with Miguel  and I asked him  I said   For a place that seems so natural  unlike like any farm I'd ever been at  how do you measure success   At that moment  it was as if a film director called for a set change. And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight  thousands and thousands of pink flamingos  a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see.  That's success   he said.  Look at their bellies  pink. They're feasting.  Feasting  I was totally confused. I said   Miguel  aren't they feasting on your fish    Yes   he said.  We lose    percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds. Well  last year  this property had         birds on it  more than     different species. It's become  today  the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe.  I said   Miguel  isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm   He shook his head  no. He said   We farm extensively  not intensively. This is an ecological network. The flamingos eat the shrimp. The shrimp eat the phytoplankton. So the pinker the belly  the better the system.  Okay  so let's review  a farm that doesn't feed its animals  and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators. A fish farm  but also a bird sanctuary. Oh  and by the way  those flamingos  they shouldn't even be there in the first place. They brood in a town     miles away  where the soil conditions are better for building nests. Every morning  they fly     miles into the farm. And every evening  they fly     miles back. They do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway A  . No kidding. I was imagining a  March of the Penguins  thing  so I looked at Miguel. I said   Miguel  do they fly     miles to the farm  and then do they fly     miles back at night  Do they do that for the children   He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song. He said   No  they do it because the food's better.  I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish  which was delicious    and I don't like fish skin  I don't like it seared  I don't like it crispy. It's that acrid  tar like flavor. I almost never cook with it. Yet  when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain  it tasted not at all like fish skin. It tasted sweet and clean  like you were taking a bite of the ocean. I mentioned that to Miguel  and he nodded. He said   The skin acts like a sponge. It's the last defense before anything enters the body. It evolved to soak up impurities.  And then he added   But our water has no impurities.  OK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish  a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators. And then I realized when he says   A farm that has no impurities   he made a big understatement  because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River. It's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days  chemical contaminants  pesticide runoff. And when it works its way through the system and leaves  the water is cleaner than when it entered. The system is so healthy  it purifies the water. So  not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals  not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators  but a farm that's literally a water purification plant    and not just for those fish  but for you and me as well. Because when that water leaves  it dumps out into the Atlantic. A drop in the ocean  I know  but I'll take it  and so should you  because this love story  however romantic  is also instructive. You might say it's a recipe for the future of good food  whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle. What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture  one in which the food actually tastes good. But for a lot people  that's a bit too radical. We're not realists  us foodies  we're lovers. We love farmers' markets  we love small family farms  we talk about local food  we eat organic. And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food  someone  somewhere stands up and says   Hey guy  I love pink flamingos  but how are you going to feed the world   How are you going to feed the world  Can I be honest  I don't love that question. No  not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world. One billion people will go hungry today. One billion    that's more than ever before    because of gross inequalities in distribution  not tonnage. Now  I don't love this question because it's determined the logic of our food system for the last    years. Feed grain to herbivores  pesticides to monocultures  chemicals to soil  chicken to fish  and all along agribusiness has simply asked   If we're feeding more people more cheaply  how terrible could that be   That's been the motivation  it's been the justification  it's been the business plan of American agriculture. We should call it what it is  a business in liquidation  a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible. That's not a business  and it isn't agriculture. Our breadbasket is threatened today  not because of diminishing supply  but because of diminishing resources. Not by the latest combine and tractor invention  but by fertile land  not by pumps  but by fresh water  not by chainsaws  but by forests  and not by fishing boats and nets  but by fish in the sea. Want to feed the world  Let's start by asking  How are we going to feed ourselves  Or better  How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself  To do that  don't look at the agribusiness model for the future. It's really old  and it's tired. It's high on capital  chemistry and machines  and it's never produced anything really good to eat. Instead  let's look to the ecological model. That's the one that relies on two billion years of on the job experience. Look to Miguel  farmers like Miguel. Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves  farms that restore instead of deplete  farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively  farmers that are not just producers  but experts in relationships. Because they're the ones that are experts in flavor  too. And if I'm going to be really honest  they're a better chef than I'll ever be. You know  I'm okay with that  because if that's the future of good food  it's going to be delicious. Thank you. For some time I have been interested in the placebo effect  which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in  unless you think of it in the terms that I do  which is   Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real.  In other words  sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies  the placebo effect  just because the person thinks that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a    for pain management  for example  if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect. Something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it. In order for us to understand each other  I want to start by showing you a rudimentary  very simple magic trick. And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least the     s. I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the     s. I'll do it for you  and then I'll explain it. And then I'll explain why I explained it. So  here's what happens. The knife  which you can examine  my hand  which you could examine. I'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this. I'll get my sleeve back. And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here. That way you can see that at no time can anything travel  as long as I'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve. And the object of this is quite simple. I'm going to open my hand  and hopefully  if all is well  my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife. In fact it's held so tightly in place that I can shake it  and the knife does not come off. Nothing goes up or down my sleeve  no trickery. And you can examine everything. Ta da  So  this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic  because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very    even though it's a very simple trick methodologically. Probably many of you in the room know this trick. What happens is this. I hold the knife in my hand. I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve  that is a lie. The reason I'm holding onto my wrist is because that's actually the secret of the illusion. In a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you  this finger right here  my index finger is just going to shift from where it is  to a position pointing out like this. Nice one. Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there. So  it goes like this  from here  right. And as I move around my finger shifts. And we could talk about why this is deceptive  why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here  because the mind  and the way it processes information  it doesn't count  one  two  three. It groups them. But that's not really what this is about. Right  And then I open my hand up. Obviously it's clinging there  not by animal magnetism  but by chicanery  my index finger being there. And then when I close my finger  same thing  as I move back  this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger. I take this hand away. You give the knife out. There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks. Now   Laughter  what does that have to do with the placebo effect  I read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open. I'm not a doctor or a researcher  so this  to me  was an astonishing thing. It turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill  that's like aspirin shaped    it's just a round white pill    it has some certain measurable effect. But if you change the form that you give the placebo in  like you make a smaller pill  and color it blue  and stamp a letter into it  it is actually measurably more effective. Even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical    they're sugar pills. But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill. What   Laughter  That really flipped me out. Turns out though  that that's not even where it stops. If you have capsules  they're more effective than tablets in any form. A colored capsule  that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule. Dosage has something to do with this. One pill twice a day is not as good at three pills    I don't remember the statistic now. Sorry. But the point is ... And the form has something to do with it. And if you want the ultimate in placebo  you've go to the needle. Right  A syringe with some inert    a couple CCs of some inert something  and you inject this into a patient ... Well this is such a powerful image in their mind  it's so much stronger than the white pill. It's a really  this graph  well I'll show it to you some other time when we have slides. The point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle. And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality  it's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect. I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick. And take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real. And we know from that study that when you want reality  you go to the needle. This is a seven inch hatpin. It's very  very sharp  and I'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit. This is really my flesh. This is not Damian's special grown flesh. That's my skin right there. This is not a Hollywood special effect. I'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side. If you're queasy     Laughs  if you faint easily    I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night  and some people that I didn't know  and one woman almost passed out. So  I suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next       in fact  you know what  I'll do the first bad part behind it. You'll get to see  you can look away too if you'd like to. So  here is what happens  right here  the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pierce. I'm sorry  man. Am I freaking you out  OK  and then just through my skin a tiny bit  and then out the other side like this. Now  essentially we're in the same position we were in with the knife trick. Sort of. But you can't count my fingers right now can you  So  let me show them to you. That's one  two three  four  five. Yes  well... I know what people think when they see this. They go   Well  he's certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes. So  let me give you a little peek. How's that look out there  Pretty good. Yeah  I know.  Laughs  And the people in the back go   OK  I didn't really see that.  People in the satellite room are starting to move in now. Let me give you good close look at this. That really is my skin. That is not a Hollywood special effect. That's my flesh  and I can twist that around. I'm sorry. If you're getting queasy  look away  don't look at the thing. People in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go   Well yeah  that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there  but if it were real he would be    see there's a hole there and a hole there  if it were real he would be bleeding. Well let me work up some blood for you. Yes  there it is. Normally now  I would take the needle out. I would clean off my arm  and I would show you that there are no wounds. But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real  I'm just going to leave it there  and walk off the stage. I will be seeing you several times over the next few days. I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much. I'm going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation. Now  usually when I mention suspended animation  people will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh. But now  I'm not talking about gorking people out to fly to Mars or even Pandora  as much fun as that may be. I'm talking about the concept of using suspended animation to help people out in trauma. So what do I mean when I say  suspended animation   It is the process by which animals de animate  appear dead and then can wake up again without being harmed. OK  so here is the sort of big idea  If you look out at nature  you find that as you tend to see suspended animation  you tend to see immortality. And so  what I'm going to tell you about is a way to tell a person who's in trauma    find a way to de animate them a bit so they're a little more immortal when they have that heart attack. An example of an organism or two that happens to be quite immortal would be plant seeds or bacterial spores. These creatures are some of the most immortal life forms on our planet  and they tend to spend most of their time in suspended animation. Bacterial spores are thought now by scientists to exist as individual cells that are alive  but in suspended animation for as long as     million years. To suggest that this all  sort of  about little  tiny creatures  I want to bring it close to home. In the immortal germ line of human beings    that is  the eggs that sit in the ovaries    they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation for up to    years in the life of each woman. So then there's also my favorite example of suspended animation. This is Sea Monkeys. Those of you with children  you know about them. You go to the pet store or the toy store  and you can buy these things. You just open the bag  and you just dump them into the plastic aquarium  and in about a week or so  you'll have little shrimps swimming around. Well  I wasn't so interested in the swimming. I was interested in what was going on in the bag  the bag on the toy store shelf where those shrimp sat in suspended animation indefinitely. So these ideas of suspended animation are not just about cells and weird  little organisms. Occasionally  human beings are briefly de animated  and the stories of people who are briefly de animated that interest me the most are those having to do with the cold. Ten years ago  there was a skier in Norway that was trapped in an icy waterfall  and she was there for two hours before they extracted her. She was extremely cold  and she had no heartbeat    for all intents and purposes she was dead  frozen. Seven hours later  still without a heartbeat  they brought her back to life  and she went on to be the head radiologist in the hospital that treated her. A couple of years later    so I get really excited about these things    about a couple of years later  there was a    month old  she was from Canada. Her father had gone out in the wintertime  he was working night shift  and she followed him outside in nothing but a diaper. And they found her hours later  frozen  lifeless  and they brought her back to life. There was a    year old woman in Duluth  Minnesota last year that was found frozen and without a pulse in her front yard one morning in the winter  and they brought her back to life. The next day  she was doing so well  they wanted to run tests on her. She got cranky and just went home. So  these are miracles  right  These are truly miraculous things that happen. Doctors have a saying that  in fact   You're not dead until you're warm and dead.  And it's true. It's true. In the New England Journal of Medicine  there was a study published that showed that with appropriate rewarming  people who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems. That's over    percent. So what I was trying to do is think of a way that we could study suspended animation to think about a way to reproduce  maybe  what happened to the skier. Well  I have to tell you something very odd  and that is that being exposed to low oxygen does not always kill. So  in this room  there's    percent oxygen or so  and if we reduce the oxygen concentration  we will all be dead. And  in fact  the animals we were working with in the lab    these little garden worms  nematodes    they were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen. And here's the thing that should freak you out. And that is that  when we lower the oxygen concentration further by     times  to    parts per million  they were not dead  they were in suspended animation  and we could bring them back to life without any harm. And this precise oxygen concentration     parts per million  that caused suspended animation  is conserved. We can see it in a variety of different organisms. One of the creatures we see it in is a fish. And we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in and out of suspended animation like you would a light switch. So this was pretty shocking to me  that we could do this. And so I was wondering  when we were trying to reproduce the work with the skier  that we noticed that  of course  she had no oxygen consumption  and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation. But  of course  she was also extremely cold. So we wondered what would happen if we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold. And so  what we found out was that  if you take animals that are animated like you and I  and you make them cold    that is  these were the garden worms    now they're dead. But if you have them in suspended animation  and move them into the cold  they're all alive. And there's the very important thing there  If you want to survive the cold  you ought to be suspended. Right  It's a really good thing. And so  we were thinking about that  about this relationship between these things  and thinking about whether or not that's what happened to the skier. And so we wondered  Might there be some agent that is in us  something that we make ourselves  that we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility in such a way as to be able to survive when we got extremely cold  and might otherwise pass away  I thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things. You know  I should mention briefly here that physiology textbooks that you can read about will tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest. We have  from the time we are slapped on the butt until we take our last dying breath    that's when we're newborn to when we're dead    we cannot reduce our metabolic rate below what's called a standard  or basal metabolic rate. But I knew that there were examples of creatures  also mammals  that do reduce their metabolic rate such as ground squirrels and bears  they reduce their metabolic rate in the wintertime when they hibernate. So I wondered  Might we be able to find some agent or trigger that might induce such a state in us  And so  we went looking for such things. And this was a period of time when we failed tremendously. Ken Robinson is here. He talked about the glories of failure. Well  we had a lot of them. We tried many different chemicals and agents  and we failed over and over again. So  one time  I was at home watching television on the couch while my wife was putting our child to bed  and I was watching a television show. It was a television show    it was a NOVA show on PBS    about caves in New Mexico. And this particular cave was Lechuguilla  and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans. The researchers had to suit up just to enter it. It's filled with this toxic gas  hydrogen sulfide. Now  hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us. We make it ourselves. The highest concentration is in our brains. Yet  it was used as a chemical warfare agent in World War I. It's an extraordinarily toxic thing. In fact  in chemical accidents  hydrogen sulfide is known to    if you breathe too much of it  you collapse to the ground  you appear dead  but if you were brought out into room air  you can be reanimated without harm  if they do that quickly. So  I thought   Wow  I have to get some of this.  Now  it's post      America  and when you go into the research institute  and you say   Hi. I'd like to buy some concentrated  compressed gas cylinders of a lethal gas because I have these ideas  see  about wanting to suspend people. It's really going to be OK.  So that's kind of a tough day  but I said   There really is some basis for thinking why you might want to do this.  As I said  this agent is in us  and  in fact  here's a curious thing  it binds to the very place inside of your cells where oxygen binds  and where you burn it  and that you do this burning to live. And so we thought  like in a game of musical chairs  might we be able to give a person some hydrogen sulfide  and might it be able to occupy that place like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind  And because you can't bind the oxygen  maybe you wouldn't consume it  and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen. I mean  who knows  So     Laughter  So  there's the bit about the dopamine and being a little bit  what do you call it  delusional  and you might suggest that was it. And so  we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold  and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal. Now  mammals are warm blooded creatures  and when we get cold  we shake and we shiver  right  We try to keep our core temperature at    degrees by actually burning more oxygen. So  it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to a mouse when it was also cold because what happened is the core temperature of the mouse got cold. It stopped moving. It appeared dead. Its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold. And here's the really important point. I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us. It's rapidly metabolized  and all you have to do after six hours of being in this state of de animation is simply put the thing out in room air  and it warms up  and it's none the worse for wear. Now  this was cosmic. Really. Because we had found a way to de animate a mammal  and it didn't hurt it. Now  we'd found a way to reduce its oxygen consumption to rock bottom levels  and it was fine. Now  in this state of de animation  it could not go out dancing  but it was not dead  and it was not harmed. So we started to think  Is this the agent that might have been present in the skier  and might have she had more of it than someone else  and might that have been able to reduce her demand for oxygen before she got so cold that she otherwise would have died  as we found out with our worm experiments  So  we wondered  Can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility  And one of the things we wondered    I'm sure some of you out there are economists  and you know all about supply and demand. And when supply is equal to demand  everything's fine  but when supply falls  in this case of oxygen  and demand stays high  you're dead. So  what I just told you is we can now reduce demand. We ought to be able to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal. And with money we got from DARPA  we could show just that. If you give mice hydrogen sulfide  you can lower their demand for oxygen  and you can put them into oxygen concentrations that are as low as       feet above the top of Mt. Everest  and they can sit there for hours  and there's no problem. Well this was really cool. We also found out that we could subject animals to otherwise lethal blood loss  and we could save them if we gave them hydrogen sulfide. So these proof of concept experiments led me to say  I should found a company  and we should take this out to a wider playing field.  I founded a company called Ikaria with others' help. And this company  the first thing it did was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide an injectable form that we could put in and send it out to physician scientists all over the world who work on models of critical care medicine  and the results are incredibly positive. In one model of heart attack  animals given hydrogen sulfide showed a    percent reduction in heart damage compared to those who got the standard of care that you and I would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today. Same is true for organ failure  when you have loss of function owing to poor perfusion of kidney  of liver  acute respiratory distress syndrome and damage suffered in cardiac bypass surgery. So  these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine all over the world saying this is true  so it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide decreases damage that you receive from being exposed to otherwise lethal low oxygen. And I should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit are low  incredibly low. In fact  so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim the metabolism of people much at all to see the benefit I just mentioned  which is a wonderful thing  if you're thinking about adopting this. You don't want to be gorking people out just to save them  it's really confusing. So  I want to say that we're in human trials. Now  and so    Thank you. The Phase   safety studies are over  and we're doing fine  we're now moved on. We have to get to Phase   and Phase  . It's going to take us a few years. This has all moved very quickly  and the mouse experiments of hibernating mice happened in       the first human studies were done in       and we should know in a couple of years whether it works or not. And this all happened really quickly because of a lot of help from a lot of people. I want to mention that  first of all  my wife  without whom this talk and my work would not be possible  so thank you very much. Also  the brilliant scientists who work at my lab and also others on staff  the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle  Washington    wonderful place to work. And also the wonderful scientists and businesspeople at Ikaria. One thing those people did out there was take this technology of hydrogen sulfide  which is this start up company that's burning venture capital very quickly  and they fused it with another company that sells another toxic gas that's more toxic than hydrogen sulfide  and they give it to newborn babies who would otherwise die from a failure to be able to oxygenate their tissues properly. And this gas that is delivered in over a thousand critical care hospitals worldwide  now is approved  on label  and saves thousands of babies a year from certain death. So it's really incredible for me to be a part of this. And I want to say that I think we're on the path of understanding metabolic flexibility in a fundamental way  and that in the not too distant future  an EMT might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide  or some related compound  to a person suffering severe injuries  and that person might de animate a bit  they might become a little more immortal. Their metabolism will fall as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home. And then  they will have the time  that will buy them the time  to be transported to the hospital to get the care they need. And then  after they get that care    like the mouse  like the skier  like the    year old woman    they'll wake up. A miracle  We hope not  or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common. Thank you very much. If you think about the phone    and Intel has tested a lot of the things I'm going to show you  over the last    years  in about     elderly households        in Ireland  and     in Portland    trying to understand  How do we measure and monitor behavior in a medically meaningful way  And if you think about the phone  right  it's something that we can use for some incredible ways to help people actually take the right medication at the right time. We're testing these kinds of simple sensor network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications. And a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone  and it's our system whispering to them which pill they need to take  and they fake like they're having a conversation with a friend. And they're not embarrassed by a meds caddy that's ugly  that sits on their kitchen table and says   I'm old. I'm frail.  It's surreptitious technology that's helping them do a simple task of taking the right pill at the right time. Now  we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones. Because that moment when you answer the phone is a cognitive test every time that you do it. Think about it  all right  I'm going to answer the phone three different times.  Hello  Hey.  All right  That's the first time.  Hello  Uh  hey.   Hello  Uh  who  Oh  hey.  All right  Very big differences between the way I answered the phone the three times. And as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time  down to the tenths of a microsecond  that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend and we start talking to them immediately  or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk  where they're like   Wait  who is this  Oh.  Right  Waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia than anything that shows up clinically today. We call these behavioral markers. There's lots of others. Is the person going to the phone as quickly  when it rings  as they used to  Is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem  Has their voice gotten more quiet  We're doing a lot of work with people with Alzheimer's and particularly with Parkinson's  where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson's patients may be the best early indicator of Parkinson's five to    years before it shows up clinically. But those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme and your voice has become so quiet. So  sensors are looking at that kind of voice. When you pick up the phone  how much tremor are you having  and what is that like  and what is that trend like over a period of time  Are you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to  Is it a dexterity problem  Is it the onset of arthritis  Are you using the phone  Are you socializing less than you used to  And looking at that pattern. And what does that decline in social health mean  as a kind of a vital sign of the future  And then wow  what a radical idea  we    except in the United States    might be able to use this newfangled technology to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line. Wow  what a great day that will be once we're allowed to actually do those kinds of things. So  these are what I would call behavioral markers. And it's the whole field that we've been trying to work on for the last    years at Intel. How do you put simple disruptive technologies  and the first of five phrases that I'm going to talk about in this talk  Behavioral markers matter. How do we change behavior  How do we measure changes in behavior in a meaningful way that's going to help us with prevention of disease  early onset of disease  and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time  Now  why would Intel let me spend a lot of time and money  over the last    years  trying to understand the needs of seniors and start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers  This is some of the field work that we've done. We have now lived with       elderly households in    countries over the last    years. We study people in Rochester  New York. We go live with them in the winter because what they do in the winter  and their access to healthcare  and how much they socialize  is very different than in the summer. If they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience. If they have a family member who is a key part of their care network  we fly and study them as well. So  we study the holistic health experience of       seniors over the last    years in    different countries. Why is Intel willing to fund that  It's because of the second slogan that I want to talk about. Ten years ago  when I started trying to convince Intel to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies that could help with independent living  this is what I called it   Y K     .  You know  back in       we were all so obsessed with paying attention to the aging of our computers  and whether or not they were going to survive the tick of the clock from      to       that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to. It was right around New Years. And that switchover  when we had the larger number of older people on the planet  for the first time than younger people. For the first time in human history    and barring aliens landing or some major other pandemic  that's the expectation from demographers  going forward. And    years ago it seemed like I had a lot of time to convince Intel to work on this. Right  Y K      was coming  the baby boomers starting to retire. Well folks  it's like we know these demographics here. This is a map of the entire world. It's like the lights are on  but nobody's home on this demographic Y K      problem. Right  I mean we sort of get it here  but we don't get it here  and we're not doing anything about it. The health reform bill is largely ignoring the realities of the age wave that's coming  and the implications for what we need to do to change not only how we pay for care  but deliver care in some radically different ways. And in fact  it's upon us. I mean you probably saw these headlines. This is Catherine Casey who is the first boomer to actually get Social Security. That actually occurred this year. She took early retirement. She was born one second after midnight in     . A retired school teacher  there she is with a Social Security administrator. The first boomer actually  we didn't even wait till       next year. We're already starting to see early retirement occur this year. All right  so it's here. This Y K      problem is at our door. This is    tsunamis scheduled on the calendar  but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it. We'll wait until it's more of a catastrophe  and react  as opposed to prepare for it. So  one of the reasons it's so challenging to prepare for this Y K problem is  I want to argue  we have what I would call mainframe poisoning. Andy Grove  about six or seven years ago  he doesn't even know or remember this  in a Fortune Magazine article he used the phrase  mainframe healthcare   and I've been extending and expanding this. He saw it written down somewhere. He's like   Eric that's a really cool concept.  I was like   Actually it was your idea. You said it in a Fortune Magazine article. I just extended it.  You know  this is the mainframe. This mentality of traveling to and timesharing large  expensive healthcare systems actually began in     . This is the first general hospital in Vienna. And actually the second general hospital in Vienna  in about       was where we started to build out an entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties. And it's a place in which we started developing architecture that literally divided the body  and divided care into departments and compartments. And it was reflected in our architecture  it was reflected in the way that we taught students  and this mainframe mentality persists today. Now  I'm not anti hospital. With my own healthcare problems  I've taken drug therapies  I've traveled to this hospital and others  many  many times. But we worship the high hospital on a hill. Right  And this is mainframe healthcare. And just as    years ago we couldn't conceive that we would have the power of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size in our purses and on our belts  that we're carrying around in our cell phone today  and suddenly  computing  that used to be an expert driven system  it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives    that shift from mainframe to personal computing is what we have to do for healthcare. We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare. We are obsessed with this way of thinking. When Intel does surveys all around the world and we say   Quick response  healthcare.  The first word that comes up is  doctor.  The second that comes up is  hospital.  And the third is  illness  or  sickness.  Right  We are wired  in our imagination  to think about healthcare and healthcare innovation as something that goes into that place. Our entire health reform discussion right now  health I.T.  when we talk with policy makers  equals  How are we going to get doctors using electronic medical records in the mainframe   We're not thinking about how do we shift from the mainframe to the home. And the problem with this is the way we conceive healthcare. Right  This is a very reactive  crisis driven system. We're doing    minute exams with patients. It's population based. We collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting  and we fix them up  like Humpty Dumpty all over again  and send them home  and hope    we might hand them a brochure  maybe an interactive website    that they do as asked and don't come back into the mainframe. And the problem is we can't afford it today  folks. We can't afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured. And now we want to do a double double of the age wave coming through  Business as usual in healthcare is broken and we've got to do something different. We've got to focus on the home. We've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm that moves care to the home. How do we be more proactive  prevention driven  How do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information    by    How do we get a personal baseline about what's going to work for you  How do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data  psychological data  relational data  in and on and around the home  And how do we drive compliance to be a customized care plan that uses all this great technology that's around us to change our behavior  That's what we need to do for our personal health model. I want to give you a couple of examples. This is Mimi from one of our studies    in her   s  had to move out of her home because her family was worried about falls. Raise your hand if you had a serious fall in your household  or any of your loved ones  your parents or so forth. Right  Classic. Hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior. This is what was happening to Mimi  the family was worried about it  moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility. She tripped over her oxygen tank. Many people in this generation won't press the button  even if they have an alert call system  because they don't want to bother anybody  even though they've been paying    dollars a month. Boomers will press the button. Trust me. They're going to be pressing that button non stop. Right  Mimi broke her pelvis  lay all night  all morning  finally somebody came in and found her  sent her to the hospital. They fixed her back up. She was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living. They put her into the nursing home unit. First night in the nursing home unit where she had been in the same assisted living facility  moved her from one bed to another  kind of threw her  rebroke her pelvis  sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from  no one read the chart  put her on Tylenol  which she is allergic to  broke out  got bedsores  basically  had heart problems  and died from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there. Now  the most frightening thing about this is this is my wife's grandmother. Now  I'm Eric Dishman. I speak English  I work for Intel  I make a good salary  I'm smart about falls and fall related injuries    it's an area of research that I work on. I have access to senators and CEOs. I can't stop this from happening. What happens if you don't have money  you don't speak English or don't have the kind of access to deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur  How do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls from ever occurring in the first place  Let me give you a quick example of work that we're doing to try to do exactly that. I've been wearing a little technology that we call Shimmer. It's a research platform. It has accelerometry. You can plug in a three lead ECG. There is all kinds of sort of plug and play kind of Legos that you can do to capture  in the wild  in the real world  things like tremor  gait  stride length and those kinds of things. The problem is  our understanding of falls today  like Mimi  is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell  from the State  saying   What were you doing when you fell   That's sort of the state of the art. But with something like Shimmer  or we have something called the Magic Carpet  embedded sensors in carpet  or camera based systems that we borrowed from sports medicine  we're starting for the first time in those     elderly households to collect actual kinematic motion data to understand  What are the subtle changes that are occurring that can show us that mom has become risk at falls  And most often we can do two interventions  fix the meds mix. I'm a qualitative researcher  but when I look at these data streams coming in from these homes  I can look at the data and tell you the day that some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else knew that they were on  because we see the changes in their patterns in the household. Right  These discoveries of behavioral markers  and behavioral changes are game changing  and like the discovery of the microscope because of our collecting data streams that we've actually never done before. This is an example in our TRIL Clinic in Ireland of    actually what you're seeing is she's looking at data  in this picture  from the Magic Carpet. So  we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway  and look at the changes in your postural sway over many months. Here's what some of this data might look like. This is actually sensor firings. These are two different subjects in our study. It's about a year's worth of data. The color represents different rooms they are in the house. This person on the left is living in their own home. This person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility. I know this because look at how punctuated meal time is when they are no longer in their particular rooms here. Right  Now  this doesn't mean that much to you. But when we look at these cycles of data over a longer period of time    and we're looking at everything from motion around different rooms in the house  to sort of micro motions that Shimmer picks up  about gait and stride length    these streams of data are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns that we've never understood before. You can go to ORCATech.org    it has nothing to do with whales  it's the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology    to see more about that. The problem is  Intel is still one of the largest funders in the world of independent living technology research. I'm not bragging about how much we fund  it's how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging  chronic disease management and independent living in the home. So  my mantra here  my fourth slogan is         households or bust. We need to drive a national  if not international  Framingham type heart study of independent living technologies  where we have        elderly connected households with broadband  full medical characterization  and a platform by which we can start to experiment and turn these from    household anecdotal studies that the universities fund  to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies. So         households or bust. These are just some of the households that we've done in the Intel studies. My fifth and final phrase  I have tried for two years  and there were moments when we were quite close  to make this healthcare reform bill be about reform from something and to something  from a mainframe model to a personal health model  or to mean something more than just a debate about the public option and how we're going to finance. It doesn't matter how we finance healthcare. We're going to figure something out for the next    years  and try it. No matter who pays for it  we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way and treating the home and the patient and the family member and the caregivers as part of these coordinated care teams and using disruptive technologies that are already here to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways. The president needs to stand up and say  at the end of a healthcare reform debate   Our goal as a country is to move    percent of care out of institutions  clinics  hospitals and nursing homes  to the home  in    years.  It's achievable. We should do it economically  we should do it morally  and we should do it for quality of life. But there is no goal within this health reform. It's just a mess today. So  you know  that's my last message to you. How do we set a going to the moon goal of dealing with the Y K     problem that's coming  It's not that innovation and technology is going to be the magic pill that cures all  but it's going to be part of the solution. And if we don't create a personal health movement  something that we're all aiming towards in reform  then we're going to move nowhere. So  I hope you'll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward. Thanks very much. I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer. I've been making games online now for    years  and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games. Now  I have a plan for this  and it entails convincing more people  including all of you  to spend more time playing bigger and better games. Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games. Some of you might be thinking   That's a lot of time to spend playing games. Maybe too much time  considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world.  But actually  according to my research at the Institute for the Future  actually the opposite is true. Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems. In fact  I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet  we need to increase that total dramatically. I've calculated the total we need at    billion hours of game play every week. So  that's probably a bit of a counter intuitive idea  so I'll say it again  let it sink in  If we want to solve problems like hunger  poverty  climate change  global conflict  obesity  I believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least    billion hours a week  by the end of the next decade. No. I'm serious. I am. Here's why. This picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species. Truly. This is a portrait by photographer Phil Toledano. He wanted to capture the emotion of gaming  so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing. And this is a classic gaming emotion. Now  if you're not a gamer  you might miss some of the nuance in this photo. You probably see the sense of urgency  a little bit of fear  but intense concentration  deep  deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem. If you are a gamer  you will notice a few nuances here  the crinkle of the eyes up  and around the mouth is a sign of optimism  and the eyebrows up is surprise. This is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an  epic win.  Oh  you've heard of that. OK  good  so we have some gamers among us. An epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive  you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it. It was almost beyond the threshold of imagination  and when you get there  you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of. That's an epic win. This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win. And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century    the face of someone who  against all odds  is on the verge of an epic win. Now  unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems. This is what I call the  I'm Not Good At Life  face. This is actually me making it. Can you see  Yes. Good. This is me making the  I'm Not Good At Life  face. This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley  California  where I did my PhD on why we're better in games than we are in real life. And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have. We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games. I don't mean just good as in successful  although that's part of it. We do achieve more in game worlds. But I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters    inspired to collaborate and to cooperate. And when we're in game worlds  I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves    the most likely to help at a moment's notice  the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes  to get up after failure and try again. And in real life  when we face failure  when we confront obstacles  we often don't feel that way. We feel overcome  we feel overwhelmed  we feel anxious  maybe depressed  frustrated or cynical. We never have those feelings when we're playing games  they just don't exist in games. So that's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student. What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything  How can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work  So I looked at games like World of Warcraft  which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment. And I started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds. The first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games  especially in World of Warcraft  there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission  right away. But not just any mission  it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game. Right  So you can do it. They never give you a challenge you can't achieve. But it is on the verge of what you're capable of  so you have to try hard. But there's no unemployment in World of Warcraft  no sitting around  wringing your hands    there's always something specific and important to be done. There are also tons of collaborators. Everywhere you go  hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission. That's not something we have in real life that easily  this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators. And there's this epic story  this inspiring story of why we're there  and what we're doing  and we get all this positive feedback. You guys have heard of leveling up     strength     intelligence. We don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life. When I get off this stage  I'm not going to have    speaking  and    crazy idea      crazy idea. I don't get that feedback in real life. Now  the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time  we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds. It's just better than reality. So  so far  collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent  .   million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth. Now  that's not necessarily a bad thing. It might sound like it's a bad thing. But to put that in context   .   million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up. That was the first upright primate. So when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games  the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution  which is an extraordinary thing. But it's also apt  because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games  we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings. We're evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species. This is true. I believe this. So  consider this really interesting statistic  it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University  The average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent        hours playing online games by the age of   . Now        hours is a really interesting number for two reasons. First of all  for children in the United States         hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school  from fifth grade to high school graduation  if you have perfect attendance. So  we have an entire parallel track of education going on  where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they're learning about everything else in school. Some of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell's new book  Outliers   so you would have heard of his theory of success  the         hours  theory of success. It's based on this great cognitive science research that says if we can master        hours of effortful study at anything by the age of     we will be virtuosos at it. We will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world. And so  now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers. So  the big question is   What exactly are gamers getting so good at   Because if we could figure that out  we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands. This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games. These are our virtuoso gamers      million people who are extraordinarily good at something. And in the next decade  we're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is. If you don't know it already  this is coming. The game industry is developing consoles that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband Internet  so that gamers all over the world  particularly in India  China  Brazil  can get online. They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade. It will bring us up to  .  billion gamers. So I've started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at. Here are the four things I came up with. The first is urgent optimism. OK  think of this as extreme self motivation. Urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle  combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success. Gamers always believe that an epic win is possible  and that it's always worth trying  and trying now. Gamers don't sit around. Gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric. There's a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them  even if they've beaten us badly. And the reason is  it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone. We trust that they will spend their time with us  that they will play by the same rules  value the same goal  stay with the game until it's over. And so  playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation. And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result. Blissful productivity. I love it. You know  there's a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer plays for    hours a week    kind of a half time job. It's because we know  when we're playing a game  that we're actually happier working hard than we are relaxing  or hanging out. We know that we are optimized as human beings  to do hard and meaningful work. And gamers are willing to work hard all the time  if they're given the right work. Finally  epic meaning. Gamers love to be attached to awe inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories. So  just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective  So  you all know Wikipedia  biggest wiki in the world. Second biggest wiki in the world  with nearly        articles  is the World of Warcraft wiki. Five million people use it every month. They have compiled more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world. They are building an epic story. They are building an epic knowledge resource about the World of Warcraft. Okay  so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing  Gamers are super empowered hopeful individuals. These are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world. And the only problem is  they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world. That's the problem that I'm trying to solve. There's an economist named Edward Castronova. His work is brilliant. He looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds. And he says   We're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments.  And he's an economist  so he's rational. And he says    Not like me  I'm a game designer  I'm exuberant. But he says that this makes perfect sense  because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life. They can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life  they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life. So he says  for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world. Now  I also agree that that is rational  for now. But it is not  by any means  an optimal situation. We have to start making the real world work more like a game. I take my inspiration from something that happened       years ago. These are ancient dice  made out of sheep's knuckles. Before we had awesome game controllers  we had sheep's knuckles. And these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings  and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus  you might know this history  which is the history of who invented games and why. Herodotus says that games  particularly dice games  were invented in the kingdom of Lydia  during a time of famine. Apparently  there was such a severe famine that the king of Lydia decided they had to do something crazy. People were suffering. People were fighting. It was an extreme situation  they needed an extreme solution. So  according to Herodotus  they invented dice games  and they set up a kingdom wide policy  On one day  everybody would eat  and on the next day  everybody would play games. And they would be so immersed in playing the dice games  because games are so engaging  and immerse us in such satisfying  blissful productivity  they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat. And then on the next day  they would play games  and on the next day  they would eat. And according to Herodotus  they passed    years this way  surviving through a famine  by eating on one day  and playing games on the next. Now  this is exactly  I think  how we're using games today. We're using games to escape real world suffering    we're using games to get away from everything that's broken in the real environment  everything that's not satisfying about real life  and we're getting what we need from games. But it doesn't have to end there. This is really exciting. According to Herodotus  after    years the famine wasn't getting better  so the king decided they would play one final dice game. They divided the entire kingdom in half. They played one dice game  and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure. They would leave Lydia  and they would go out in search of a new place to live  leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available  and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive. Now  this sounds crazy  right  But recently  DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans  who then led to the Roman Empire  actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians. And so  recently  scientists have suggested that Herodotus' crazy story is actually true. And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly    years  that could have explained the famine. So this crazy story might be true. They might have actually saved their culture by playing games  escaping to games for    years  and then been so inspired  and knew so much about how to come together with games  that they actually saved the entire civilization that way. Okay  we can do that. We've been playing Warcraft since     . That was the first real time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series. That was    years ago. They played dice games for    years  we've been playing Warcraft for    years. I say we are ready for our own epic game. Now  they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world  so that's where I get my    billion hours a week of game play from. Let's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games  until we solve real world problems. Now  I know you're asking   How are we going to solve real world problems in games   Well  that's what I've devoted my work to over the past few years  at the Institute for the Future. We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto  and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future. We do not want to try to predict the future. What we want to do is make the future. We want to imagine the best case scenario outcome  and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality. We want to imagine epic wins  and then give people the means to achieve the epic win. I'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures. This is World Without Oil. We made this game in     . This is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage. The oil shortage is fictional  but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real  and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil. So when you come to the game  you sign up  tell us where you live  and then we give you real time news videos  data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs  what's not available  how food supply is being affected  how transportation is being affected  if schools are closed  if there's rioting  and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true. And then we ask you to blog about it  to post videos  to post photos. We piloted this game with       players in       and we've tracked them for the three years since. And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience. Nobody wants to change how they live  just because it's good for the world  or because we're supposed to. But if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them   We've run out of oil. This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on. Challenge yourself to see how you would survive   most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game. So for the next world saving game  we decided to aim higher    bigger problem than just peak oil. We did a game called Superstruct at the Institute for the Future. And the premise was  a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only    years left on the planet. This supercomputer was called the Global Extinction Awareness System  of course. We asked people to come online    almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies  you form a dream team    you've got the astronaut  the scientist  the ex convict  and they all have something to do to save the world. But in our game  instead of just having five people on the dream team  we said   Everybody's on the dream team  and it's your job to invent the future of energy  the future of food  the future of health  the future of security and the future of the social safety net.  We had       people play that game for eight weeks. They came up with     insanely creative solutions that you can go online  Google  Superstruct   and see. So  finally  the last game  we're launching it March  rd. This is a game done with the World Bank Institute. If you complete the game  you will be certified by the World Bank Institute as a Social Innovator  class of     . Working with universities all over sub Saharan Africa  and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills. We've got a graphic novel  we've got leveling up in skills like local insight  knowledge networking  sustainability  vision and resourcefulness. I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people  anywhere in the world  particularly in developing areas  who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world. So  I'm going to wrap up now. I want to ask a question. What do you think happens next  We've got all these amazing gamers  we've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do  but none of them have saved the real world yet. Well I hope you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real world work  that games are a powerful platform for change. We have all these amazing superpowers  blissful productivity  the ability to weave a tight social fabric  this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning. I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter  to survive on this planet for another century. That's my hope  that you will join me in making and playing games like this. When I look forward to the next decade  I know two things for sure  that we can make any future we can imagine  and we can play any games we want  so I say  Let the world changing games begin. Thank you. OK. We've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind. And what I'd like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed when someone is in a survival situation  how the will to survive can bring that out in people. This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest  it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest. And when it occurred  I was the only doctor on the mountain. So I'll take you through that and we'll see what it's like when someone really summons the will to survive. OK  this is Mount Everest. It's        feet high. I've been there six times  Four times I did work with National Geographic  making tectonic plate measurements  twice  I went with NASA doing remote sensing devices. It was on my fourth trip to Everest that a comet passed over the mountain. Hyakutake. And the Sherpas told us then that was a very bad omen  and we should have listened to them. Everest is an extreme environment. There's only one third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level. Near the summit  temperatures can be    degrees below zero. You can have winds    to    miles an hour. It's actually a wind chill factor which is lower than a summer day on Mars. I remember one time being up near the summit  I reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle  inside my down jacket  only to discover that the water was already frozen solid. That gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit. OK  this is the route up Everest. It starts at base camp  at        feet. Camp One        feet higher. Camp Two  another       feet higher up  what's called the Western Cwm. CampThree is at the base of Lhotse  which is the fourth highest mountain in the world  but it's dwarfed by Everest. And then Camp Four is the highest camp  that's       feet short of the summit. This is a view of base camp. This is pitched on a glacier at        feet. It's the highest point you can bring your yaks before you have to unload. And this is what they unloaded for me  I had four yak loads of medical supplies  which are dumped in a tent  and here I am trying to arrange things. This was our expedition. It was a National Geographic expedition  but it was organized by The Explorers Club. There were three other expeditions on the mountain  an American team  a New Zealand team and an IMAX team. And  after actually two months of preparation  we built our camps all the way up the mountain. This is a view looking up the icefall  the first       feet of the climb up from base camp. And here's a picture in the icefall  it's a waterfall  but it's frozen  but it moves very slowly  and it actually changes every day. When you're in it  you're like a rat in a maze  you can't even see over the top. This is near the top of the icefall. You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen. That way  it's less likely to tumble down on you. These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun up. This is me crossing a crevasse. We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached. That's another crevasse. Some of these things are    stories deep or more  and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we're climbing over  we would never do it. Okay. This is Camp One. It's the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall. And from there we climb up to Camp Two  which is sort of the foreground. These are climbers moving up the Lhotse face  that mountain toward Camp Three. They're on fixed ropes here. A fall here  if you weren't roped in  would be       feet down. This is a view taken from camp three. You can see the Lhotse face is in profile  it's about a    degree angle. It takes two days to climb it  so you put the camp halfway through. If you notice  the summit of Everest is black. There's no ice over it. And that's because Everest is so high  it's in the jet stream  and winds are constantly scouring the face  so no snow gets to accumulate. What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit. This is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four  moving in  up through the clouds. And this is at Camp Four. Once you get to Camp Four  you have maybe    hours to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not. Everybody's on oxygen  your supplies are limited  and you either have to go up or go down  make that decision very quickly. This is a picture of Rob Hall. He was the leader of the New Zealand team. This is a radio he used later to call his wife that I'll tell you about. These are some climbers waiting to go to the summit. They're up at Camp Four  and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit. This is not good weather to climb in  so the climbers are just waiting  hoping that the wind's going to die down. And  in fact  the wind does die down at night. It becomes very calm  there's no wind at all. This looks like a good chance to go for the summit. So here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what's called the Triangular Face. It's the first part of climb. It's done in the dark  because it's actually less steep than what comes next  and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark. So that's what happened. The climbers got on the southeast ridge. This is the view looking at the southeast ridge. The summit would be in the foreground. From here  it's about       feet up at a    degree angle to the summit. But what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up. A storm blew in that no one was anticipating. You can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow way high off the summit. And there were climbers on that summit ridge. This is a picture of me in that area taken a year before  and you can see I've got an oxygen mask on with a rebreather. I have an oxygen hose connected here. You can see on this climber  we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack    little titanium tanks  very lightweight    and we're not carrying much else. This is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge. OK  this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself. This is on the way toward the summit  on that       foot bridge. All the climbers here are climbing unroped  and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody  you'd wind up just pulling them off with you. So each person climbs individually. And it's not a straight path at all  it's very difficult climbing  and there's always the risk of falling on either side. If you fall to your left  you're going to fall       feet into Nepal  if you fall to your right  you're going to fall        feet into Tibet. So it's probably better to fall into Tibet because you'll live longer. But  either way  you fall for the rest of your life. OK. Those climbers were up near the summit  along that summit ridge that you see up there  and I was down here in Camp Three. My expedition was down in Camp Three  while these guys were up there in the storm. The storm was so fierce that we had to lay  fully dressed  fully equipped  laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain. It was the worst winds I've ever seen. And the climbers up on the ridge were that much higher        feet higher  and completely exposed to the elements. We were in radio contact with some of them. This is a view taken along the summit ridge. Rob Hall  we heard by radio  was up here  at this point in the storm with Doug Hansen. And we heard that Rob was OK  but Doug was too weak to come down. He was exhausted  and Rob was staying with him. We also got some bad news in the storm that Beck Weathers  another climber  had collapsed in the snow and was dead. There were still    other climbers that we weren't aware of their condition. They were lost. There was total confusion on the mountain  all the stories were confusing  most of them were conflicting. We really had no idea what was going on during that storm. We were just hunkered down in our tents at Camp Three. Our two strongest climbers  Todd Burleson and Pete Athans  decided to go up to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going. They tried to radio a message to Rob Hall  who was a superb climber stuck  sort of  with a weak climber up near the summit. I expected them to say to Rob   Hold on. We're coming.  But in fact  what they said was   Leave Doug and come down yourself. There's no chance of saving him  and just try to save yourself at this point.  And Rob got that message  but his answer was   We're both listening.  Todd and Pete got up to the summit ridge  up in here  and it was a scene of complete chaos up there. But they did what they could to stabilize the people. I gave them radio advice from Camp Three  and we sent down the climbers that could make it down under their own power. The ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four. So the climbers were coming down along this route. This is taken from Camp Three  where I was. And they all came by me so I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them  which is really not much  because Camp Three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a    degree angle. You can barely stand outside the tent. It's really cold  it's        feet. The only supplies I had at that altitude were two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids. So  as the climbers came by me  I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down. The ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated  I would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain. It's so awkward to work up there that sometimes I even gave the injections right through their clothes. It was just too hard to maneuver any other way up there. While I was taking care of them  we got more news about Rob Hall. There was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him. He called in to say that he was alone now. Apparently  Doug had died higher up on the mountain. But Rob was now too weak to come down himself  and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude  he was just beyond rescue and he knew it. At that point  he asked to be paged into his wife. He was carrying a radio. His wife was home in New Zealand  seven months pregnant with their first child  and Rob asked to be patched into her. That was done  and Rob and his wife had their last conversation. They picked the name for their baby. Rob then signed off  and that was the last we ever heard of him. I was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients at        feet  which was an impossibility. So what we did was  we got the victims down to        feet  where it was easier for me to treat them. This was my medical kit. It's a tackle box filled with medical supplies. This is what I carried up the mountain. I had more supplies lower down  which I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp. And this was scene at the lower camp. The survivors came in one by one. Some of them were hypothermic  some of them were frostbitten  some were both. What we did was try to warm them up as best we could  put oxygen on them and try to revive them  which is difficult to do at        feet  when the tent is freezing. This is some severe frostbite on the feet  severe frostbite on the nose. This climber was snow blind. As I was taking care of these climbers  we got a startling experience. Out of nowhere  Beck Weathers  who we had already been told was dead  stumbled into the tent  just like a mummy  he walked into the tent. I expected him to be incoherent  but  in fact  he walked into the tent and said to me   Hi  Ken. Where should I sit   And then he said   Do you accept my health insurance   He really said that. So he was completely lucid  but he was very severely frostbitten. You can see his hand is completely white  his face  his nose  is burned. First  it turns white  and then when it's completed necrosis  it turns black  and then it falls off. It's the last stage  just like a scar. So  as I was taking care of Beck  he related what had been going on up there. He said he had gotten lost in the storm  collapsed in the snow  and just laid there  unable to move. Some climbers had come by and looked at him  and he heard them say   He's dead.  But Beck wasn't dead  he heard that  but he was completely unable to move. He was in some sort of catatonic state where he could be aware of his surroundings  but couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive. So the climbers passed him by  and Beck lay there for a day  a night and another day  in the snow. And then he said to himself   I don't want to die. I have a family to come back to.  And the thoughts of his family  his kids and his wife  generated enough energy  enough motivation in him  so that he actually got up. After laying in the snow that long a time  he got up and found his way back to the camp. And Beck told me that story very quietly  but I was absolutely stunned by it. I couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time and then getting up. He apparently reversed an irreversible hypothermia. And I can only try to speculate on how he did it. So  what if we had Beck hooked up to a SPECT scan  something that could actually measure brain function  Just very simply  the three parts of the brain  the frontal lobe  where you focus your attention and concentration  you have the temporal lobe  where you form images and keep memories  and the posterior part of your brain  which contains the cerebellum  which controls motion  and the brain stem  where you have your basic maintenance functions  like heartbeat and respiration. So let's take a cut through the brain here  and imagine that Beck was hooked up to a SPECT scan. This measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain. So you have the prefrontal cortex here  lighting up in red. This is a pretty evenly distributed scan. You have the middle area  where the temporal lobe might be  in here  and the posterior portion  where the maintenance functions are in the back. This is a roughly normal scan  showing equal distribution of energy. Now  you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up. This might be what Beck would be experiencing when he realizes he's in danger. He's focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble. These parts of the brain are quieting down. He's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point  and he's working pretty hard. He's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this. OK  but he's losing ground here. He's running out of energy. It's too cold  he can't keep his metabolic fires going  and  you see  there's no more red here  his brain is quieting down. He's collapsed in the snow here. Everything is quiet  there's very little red anywhere. Beck is powering down. He's dying. You go on to the next scan  but  in Beck's case  you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again. He's beginning to think about his family. He's beginning to have images that are motivating him to get up. He's developing energy in this area through thought. And this is how he's going to turn thought back into action. This part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus. It's an area in which a lot of neuroscientists believe the seat of will exists. This is where people make decisions  where they develop willpower. And  you can see  there's an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain  where he's got images of his family  into this area  which is powering his will. Okay. This is getting stronger and stronger to the point where it's actually going to be a motivating factor. He's going to develop enough energy in that area    after a day  a night and a day    to actually motivate himself to get up. And you can see here  he's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe. He's beginning to focus  he can concentrate now. He's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself. So this energy has been transmitted up toward the front of his brain  and it's getting quieter down here  but he's using this energy to think about what he has to do to get himself going. And then  that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas. He's not thinking about his family now  and he's getting himself motivated. This is the posterior part  where his muscles are going to be moving  and he's going to be pacing himself. His heart and lungs are going to pick up speed. So this is what I can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck during this survival epic. So here I am taking care of Beck at        feet  and I felt what I was doing was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself. It just shows you what the power of the mind can do. He was critically ill  there were other critically ill patients  luckily  we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys. A helicopter came in at        feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history. It was able to land on the ice  take away Beck and the other survivors  one by one  and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic before we even got back to base camp. This is a scene at base camp  at one of the camps where some of the climbers were lost. And we had a memorial service there a few days later. These are Serphas lighting juniper branches. They believe juniper smoke is holy. And the climbers stood around on the high rocks and spoke of the climbers who were lost up near the summit  turning to the mountain  actually  to talk to them directly. There were five climbers lost here. This was Scott Fischer  Rob Hall  Andy Harris  Doug Hansen and Yasuko Namba. And one more climber should have died that day  but didn't  and that's Beck Weathers. He was able to survive because he was able to generate that incredible willpower  he was able to use all the power of his mind to save himself. These are Tibetan prayer flags. These Sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags  the message will be carried up to the gods  and that year  Beck's message was answered. Thank you. So  I was just asked to go and shoot this film called  Elizabeth.  And we're all talking about this great English icon and saying   She's a fantastic woman  she does everything. How are we going to introduce her   So we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer  and they came to me and said   Shekhar  what do you think   And I said   I think she's dancing.  And I could see everybody looked at me  somebody said   Bollywood.  The other said   How much did we hire him for   And the third said   Let's find another director.  I thought I had better change. So we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce Elizabeth  and I said   OK  maybe I am too Bollywood. Maybe Elizabeth  this great icon  dancing  What are you talking about   So I rethought the whole thing  and then we all came to a consensus. And here was the introduction of this great British icon called  Elizabeth.  Leicester  May I join you  my lady  Elizabeth  If it please you  sir. Shekhar Kapur  So she was dancing. So how many people who saw the film did not get that here was a woman in love  that she was completely innocent and saw great joy in her life  and she was youthful  And how many of you did not get that  That's the power of visual storytelling  that's the power of dance  that's the power of music  the power of not knowing. When I go out to direct a film  every day we prepare too much  we think too much. Knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom. You know  simple words lost in the quicksand of experience. So I come up  and I say   What am I going to do today   I'm not going to do what I planned to do  and I put myself into absolute panic. It's my one way of getting rid of my mind  getting rid of this mind that says   Hey  you know what you're doing. You know exactly what you're doing. You're a director  you've done it for years.  So I've got to get there and be in complete panic. It's a symbolic gesture. I tear up the script  I go and I panic myself  I get scared. I'm doing it right now  you can watch me. I'm getting nervous  I don't know what to say  I don't know what I'm doing  I don't want to go there. And as I go there  of course  my A.D. says   You know what you're going to do  sir.  I say   Of course I do.  And the studio executives  they would say   Hey  look at Shekhar. He's so prepared.  And inside I've just been listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan because he's chaotic. I'm allowing myself to go into chaos because out of chaos  I'm hoping some moments of truth will come. All preparation is preparation. I don't even know if it's honest. I don't even know if it's truthful. The truth of it all comes on the moment  organically  and if you get five great moments of great  organic stuff in your storytelling  in your film  your film  audiences will get it. So I'm looking for those moments  and I'm standing there and saying   I don't know what to say.  So  ultimately  everybody's looking at you      people at seven in the morning who got there at quarter to seven  and you arrived at seven  and everybody's saying   Hey. What's the first thing  What's going to happen   And you put yourself into a state of panic where you don't know  and so you don't know. And so  because you don't know  you're praying to the universe because you're praying to the universe that something    I'm going to try and access the universe the way Einstein    say a prayer    accessed his equations  the same source. I'm looking for the same source because creativity comes from absolutely the same source that you meditate somewhere outside yourself  outside the universe. You're looking for something that comes and hits you. Until that hits you  you're not going to do the first shot. So what do you do  So Cate says   Shekhar  what do you want me to do   And I say   Cate  what do you want to do    Laughter   You're a great actor  and I like to give to my actors    why don't you show me what you want to do   What am I doing  I'm trying to buy time. I'm trying to buy time. So the first thing about storytelling that I learned  and I follow all the time is  Panic. Panic is the great access of creativity because that's the only way to get rid of your mind. Get rid of your mind. Get out of it  get it out. And let's go to the universe because there's something out there that is more truthful than your mind  that is more truthful than your universe.  unclear   you said that yesterday. I'm just repeating it because that's what I follow constantly to find the shunyata somewhere  the emptiness. Out of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity. So that's what I do. When I was a kid    I was about eight years old. You remember how India was. There was no pollution. In Delhi  we used to live    we used to call it a chhat or the khota. Khota's now become a bad word. It means their terrace    and we used to sleep out at night. At school I was being just taught about physics  and I was told that if there is something that exists  then it is measurable. If it is not measurable  it does not exist. And at night I would lie out  looking at the unpolluted sky  as Delhi used to be at that time when I was a kid  and I used to stare at the universe and say   How far does this universe go   My father was a doctor. And I would think   Daddy  how far does the universe go   And he said   Son  it goes on forever.  So I said   Please measure forever because in school they're teaching me that if I cannot measure it  it does not exist. It doesn't come into my frame of reference.  So  how far does eternity go  What does forever mean  And I would lie there crying at night because my imagination could not touch creativity. So what did I do  At that time  at the tender age of seven  I created a story. What was my story  And I don't know why  but I remember the story. There was a woodcutter who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood  and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax. And when that ax hits that piece of wood  that's when everything will destroy and the Big Bang will happen again. But all before that there was a woodcutter. And then when I would run out of that story  I would imagine that woodcutter's universe is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter. So every time  I could tell my story again and again and get over this problem  and so I got over the problem. How did I do it  Tell a story. So what is a story  A story is our    all of us    we are the stories we tell ourselves. In this universe  and this existence  where we live with this duality of whether we exist or not and who are we  the stories we tell ourselves are the stories that define the potentialities of our existence. We are the stories we tell ourselves. So that's as wide as we look at stories. A story is the relationship that you develop between who you are  or who you potentially are  and the infinite world  and that's our mythology. We tell our stories  and a person without a story does not exist. So Einstein told a story and followed his stories and came up with theories and came up with theories and then came up with his equations. Alexander had a story that his mother used to tell him  and he went out to conquer the world. We all  everybody  has a story that they follow. We tell ourselves stories. So  I will go further  and I say   I tell a story  and therefore I exist.  I exist because there are stories  and if there are no stories  we don't exist. We create stories to define our existence. If we do not create the stories  we probably go mad. I don't know  I'm not sure  but that's what I've done all the time. Now  a film. A film tells a story. I often wonder when I make a film    I'm thinking of making a film of the Buddha    and I often wonder  If Buddha had all the elements that are given to a director    if he had music  if he had visuals  if he had a video camera    would we get Buddhism better  But that puts some kind of burden on me. I have to tell a story in a much more elaborate way  but I have the potential. It's called subtext. When I first went to Hollywood  they said    I used to talk about subtext  and my agent came to me   Would you kindly not talk about subtext   And I said   Why   He said   Because nobody is going to give you a film if you talk about subtext. Just talk about plot and say how wonderful you'll shoot the film  what the visuals will be.  So when I look at a film  here's what we look for  We look for a story on the plot level  then we look for a story on the psychological level  then we look for a story on the political level  then we look at a story on a mythological level. And I look for stories on each level. Now  it is not necessary that these stories agree with each other. What is wonderful is  at many times  the stories will contradict with each other. So when I work with Rahman who's a great musician  I often tell him   Don't follow what the script already says. Find that which is not. Find the truth for yourself  and when you find the truth for yourself  there will be a truth in it  but it may contradict the plot  but don't worry about it.  So  the sequel to  Elizabeth    Golden Age.  When I made the sequel to  Elizabeth   here was a story that the writer was telling  A woman who was threatened by Philip II and was going to war  and was going to war  fell in love with Walter Raleigh. Because she fell in love with Walter Raleigh  she was giving up the reasons she was a queen  and then Walter Raleigh fell in love with her lady in waiting  and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war or she wanted... Here's the story I was telling  The gods up there  there were two people. There was Philip II  who was divine because he was always praying  and there was Elizabeth  who was divine  but not quite divine because she thought she was divine  but the blood of being mortal flowed in her. But the divine one was unjust  so the gods said   OK  what we need to do is help the just one.  And so they helped the just one. And what they did was  they sent Walter Raleigh down to physically separate her mortal self from her spirit self. And the mortal self was the girl that Walter Raleigh was sent  and gradually he separated her so she was free to be divine. And the two divine people fought  and the gods were on the side of divinity. Of course  all the British press got really upset. They said   We won the Armada.  But I said   But the storm won the Armada. The gods sent the storm.  So what was I doing  I was trying to find a mythic reason to make the film. Of course  when I asked Cate Blanchett  I said   What's the film about   She said   The film's about a woman coming to terms with growing older.  Psychological. The writer said  It's about history  plot.  I said  It's about mythology  the gods.  So let me show you a film    a piece from that film    and how a camera also    so this is a scene  where in my mind  she was at the depths of mortality. She was discovering what mortality actually means  and if she is at the depths of mortality  what really happens. And she's recognizing the dangers of mortality and why she should break away from mortality. Remember  in the film  to me  both her and her lady in waiting were parts of the same body  one the mortal self and one the spirit self. So can we have that second  Elizabeth  Bess  Bess  Bess Throckmorton  Bess  Here  my lady. Elizabeth  Tell me  is it true  Are you with child  Are you with child  Bess  Yes  my lady. Elizabeth  Traitorous. You dare to keep secrets from me  You ask my permission before you rut  before you breed. My bitches wear my collars. Do you hear me  Do you hear me  Walsingham  Majesty. Please  dignity. Mercy. Elizabeth  This is no time for mercy  Walsingham. You go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business. Is it his  Tell me. Say it. Is the child his  Is it his  Bess  Yes. My lady  it is my husband's child. Elizabeth  Bitch   Cries  Raleigh  Majesty. This is not the queen I love and serve. Elizabeth  This man has seduced a ward of the queen  and she has married without royal consent. These offenses are punishable by law. Arrest him. Go. You no longer have the queen's protection. Bess  As you wish  Majesty. Elizabeth  Get out  Get out  Get out  Get out. Shekhar Kapur  So  what am I trying to do here  Elizabeth has realized  and she's coming face to face with her own sense of jealousy  her own sense of mortality. What am I doing with the architecture  The architecture is telling a story. The architecture is telling a story about how  even though she's the most powerful woman in the world at that time  there is the other  the architecture's bigger. The stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic. It'll survive her. So it's telling you  to me  stone is part of her destiny. Not only that  why is the camera looking down  The camera's looking down at her because she's in the well. She's in the absolute well of her own sense of being mortal. That's where she has to pull herself out from the depths of mortality  come in  release her spirit. And that's the moment where  in my mind  both Elizabeth and Bess are the same person. But that's the moment she's surgically removing herself from that. So the film is operating on many many levels in that scene. And how we tell stories visually  with music  with actors  and at each level it's a different sense and sometimes contradictory to each other. So how do I start all this  What's the process of telling a story  About ten years ago  I heard this little thing from a politician  not a politician that was very well respected in India. And he said that these people in the cities  in one flush  expend as much water as you people in the rural areas don't get for your family for two days. That struck a chord  and I said   That's true.  I went to see a friend of mine  and he made me wait in his apartment in Malabar Hill on the twentieth floor  which is a really  really upmarket area in Mumbai. And he was having a shower for    minutes. I got bored and left  and as I drove out  I drove past the slums of Bombay  as you always do  and I saw lines and lines in the hot midday sun of women and children with buckets waiting for a tanker to come and give them water. And an idea started to develop. So how does that become a story  I suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster. So my next film is called  Paani  which means water. And now  out of the mythology of that  I'm starting to create a world. What kind of world do I create  and where does the idea  the design of that come  So  in my mind  in the future  they started to build flyovers. You understand flyovers  Yeah  They started to build flyovers to get from A to B faster  but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth to another area of relative wealth. And then what they did was they created a city above the flyovers. And the rich people moved to the upper city and left the poorer people in the lower cities  about    to    percent of the people have moved to the upper city. Now  where does this upper city and lower city come  There's a mythology in India about    where they say  and I'll say it in Hindi   Hindi  Right. What does that mean  It says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders and survive on the shoulders of the poor. So  from that mythology  the upper city and lower city come. So the design has a story. And now  what happens is that the people of the upper city  they suck up all the water. Remember the word I said  suck up. They suck up all the water  keep to themselves  and they drip feed the lower city. And if there's any revolution  they cut off the water. And  because democracy still exists  there's a democratic way in which you say  Well  if you give us what  we want   we'll give you water.  So  okay my time is up. But I can go on about telling you how we evolve stories  and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get translated into the particular discipline that I am in  which is film. But ultimately  what is a story  It's a contradiction. Everything's a contradiction. The universe is a contradiction. And all of us are constantly looking for harmony. When you get up  the night and day is a contradiction. But you get up at   a.m. That first blush of blue is where the night and day are trying to find harmony with each other. Harmony is the notes that Mozart didn't give you  but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that. All contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony. It's the effect of looking for harmony in the contradiction that exists in a poet's mind  a contradiction that exists in a storyteller's mind. In a storyteller's mind  it's a contradiction of moralities. In a poet's mind  it's a conflict of words  in the universe's mind  between day and night. In the mind of a man and a woman  we're looking constantly at the contradiction between male and female  we're looking for harmony within each other. The whole idea of contradiction  but the acceptance of contradiction is the telling of a story  not the resolution. The problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywood and many films  and as  unclear  was saying in his  that we try to resolve the contradiction. Harmony is not resolution. Harmony is the suggestion of a thing that is much larger than resolution. Harmony is the suggestion of something that is embracing and universal and of eternity and of the moment. Resolution is something that is far more limited. It is finite  harmony is infinite. So that storytelling  like all other contradictions in the universe  is looking for harmony and infinity in moral resolutions  resolving one  but letting another go  letting another go and creating a question that is really important. Thank you very much. I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values. Now  it's generally understood that questions of morality    questions of good and evil and right and wrong    are questions about which science officially has no opinion. It's thought that science can help us get what we value  but it can never tell us what we ought to value. And  consequently  most people    I think most people probably here    think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life  questions like   What is worth living for    What is worth dying for    What constitutes a good life   So  I'm going to argue that this is an illusion    that the separation between science and human values is an illusion    and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history. Now  it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values  because science deals with facts  and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres. It's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be. But I think this is quite clearly untrue. Values are a certain kind of fact. They are facts about the well being of conscious creatures. Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks  Why don't we feel compassion for rocks  It's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects  as indeed we are  it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering. Now  the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim  This is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects. And there's no notion  no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes. Even if you get your values from religion  even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death    either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell    you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes. And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim  which  of course  may or may not be true. Now  to speak about the conditions of well being in this life  for human beings  we know that there is a continuum of such facts. We know that it's possible to live in a failed state  where everything that can go wrong does go wrong    where mothers cannot feed their children  where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration  where people are murdered indiscriminately. And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic  to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable. And we know    we know    that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space. Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea  Probably not. Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye  so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors  Probably not. There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish  whether or not we understand these truths. And morality relates to these truths. So  in talking about values we are talking about facts. Now  of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels    from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements. But if we're going to talk about human well being we are  of necessity  talking about the human brain. Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain    whatever happens after death. Even if the suicide bomber does get    virgins in the afterlife  in this life  his personality    his rather unfortunate personality    is the product of his brain. So the contributions of culture    if culture changes us  as indeed it does  it changes us by changing our brains. And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can  at least in principle  be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind    neuroscience  psychology  etc. So  what I'm arguing is that value's reduced to facts    to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings. And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings. And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape  with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well being of conscious creatures  both personal and collective. And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well being that we rarely access  that few people access. And these await our discovery. Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual. Perhaps there are other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them. Now  let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space  or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question. I don't think  for instance  that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child  or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities  or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense. But if questions affect human well being then they do have answers  whether or not we can find them. And just admitting this    just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish    will change the way we talk about morality  and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future. For instance  there are    states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal  where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board  hard  and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin. And hundreds of thousands of children  incidentally  are subjected to this every year. The locations of these enlightened districts  I think  will fail to surprise you. We're not talking about Connecticut. And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious. The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod  lest we spoil the child    this is in Proverbs    and     and I believe    . But we can ask the obvious question  Is it a good idea  generally speaking  to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior  Is there any doubt that this question has an answer  and that it matters  Now  many of you might worry that the notion of well being is truly undefined  and seemingly perpetually open to be re construed. And so  how therefore can there be an objective notion of well being  Well  consider by analogy  the concept of physical health. The concept of physical health is undefined. As we just heard from Michael Specter  it has changed over the years. When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably   . It's now around    in the developed world. There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age     will be considered a profound disability. People will send you donations when you're in that condition. Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open  genuinely open for revision  does not make it vacuous. The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science. Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape  There may be equivalent ways to thrive  there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing. Now  why wouldn't this undermine an objective morality  Well think of how we talk about food  I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat. There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food. But there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison. The fact that there are many right answers to the question   What is food   does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition. Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions. So  for instance  if it's really wrong to lie  it must always be wrong to lie  and if you can find an exception  well then there's no such thing as moral truth. Why would we think this  Consider  by analogy  the game of chess. Now  if you're going to play good chess  a principle like   Don't lose your Queen   is very good to follow. But it clearly admits some exceptions. There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do. There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do. And yet  chess is a domain of perfect objectivity. The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all. Now  this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere. Consider the great problem of women's bodies  What to do about them  Well this is one thing you can do about them  You can cover them up. Now  it is the position  generally speaking  of our intellectual community that while we may not like this  we might think of this as  wrong  in Boston or Palo Alto  who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags  And who are we to say  even  that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable  or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way  Well  who are we not to say this  Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well being that we have to be non judgmental about a practice like this  I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil    women should be able to wear whatever they want  as far as I'm concerned. But what does voluntary mean in a community where  when a girl gets raped  her father's first impulse  rather often  is to murder her out of shame  Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute  Your daughter gets raped  and what you want to do is kill her. What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing  Now  to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society. For instance  this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world. Now  granted  for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images. But if we are in a reflective mood  we can ask   Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies   I mean  is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children  Probably not. OK  so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance. Perhaps there are many such places    again  given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape. But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak. Now the irony  from my perspective  is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another. And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind  not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well being. In fact  the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering. This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue. But the demagogues are right about one thing  We need a universal conception of human values. Now  what stands in the way of this  Well  one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality    especially secular  academic  scientist types. When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives. So  for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion  and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness. On the other hand  we have someone like Ted Bundy  Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women. So  we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time. Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say   Well  there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about    really right about    or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science. He likes chocolate  he likes vanilla. There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other.  Notice that we don't do this in science. On the left you have Edward Witten. He's a string theorist. If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around  in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten. The other half will tell you they don't like the question. So  what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said  String theory is bogus. It doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale. I'm not a fan.  Well  nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist  I don't understand string theory. I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory. I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member. But this is just the point. Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded. That is what it is to have a domain of expertise. That is what it is for knowledge to count. How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise  or moral talent  or moral genius even  How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count  How have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering  Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering  No. How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well being  So  this  I think  is what the world needs now. It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing  and morality relates to that domain of facts. It is possible for individuals  and even for whole cultures  to care about the wrong things  which is to say that it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering. Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality. We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less  and they will one day mean nothing. We live in a world filled with destructive technology  and this technology cannot be uninvented  it will always be easier to break things than to fix them. It seems to me  therefore  patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads  or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes. We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life. And to do that  we have to admit that these questions have answers. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  So  some combustible material there. Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world  hearing some of this  may well be doing the screaming with rage thing  after as well  some of them. Language seems to be really important here. When you're talking about the veil  you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags. I've lived in the Muslim world  spoken with a lot of Muslim women. And some of them would say something else. They would say   No  you know  this is a celebration of female specialness  it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that     and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view     that male lust is not to be trusted.  I mean  can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist  Sam Harris  Yeah  well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence  watching the clock ticking  but the question is  What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations  and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself  And so  if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil  or a very funny hat  or tattoo their face    I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want  but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under. And so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it  especially when it's     degrees out and you're wearing a full burqa. CA  A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress. But can you reconcile that  I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn't become one dimensional  where we all have to think the same. Paint your picture of what rolling the clock    years forward      years forward  how you would like to think of the world  balancing moral progress with richness. SH  Well  I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail  then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail. So  we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion  and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it    whether they're genetic  whether they're how people talk to one another  whether they're economic systems  and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space. So  everything is not going to be up for grabs. It's not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well educated in the context of men who do desire women. I mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea    but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them. Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems  And I think there are clearly right answers to that. CA  And if the results come out that actually they do  are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues  SH  Well yeah  modulo one obvious fact  that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system. So  you can say like   Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend  I chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do.  If you get all those parts aligned  yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love. But again  then we have to talk about well being in a larger context. It's all of us in this together  not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus. CA  Sam  this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours. We don't have that  but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED. SH  Really an honor. Thank you. Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna  especially birds  and mainly to supply the pet market with thousands of animals taken from nature every month  and transported far from their origins  to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and S o Paulo. It is estimated that all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil withdraw from nature almost    million animals every year  a business worth almost two billion dollars. The police intercepts these huge cargos with live animals  intended to supply the pet market  or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses  and this is how we end up  every month  with thousands of seized animals. And for us to understand what happens with them  we're going to follow Brad. In the eyes of many people  after the animals are seized  they say   Yay  justice has been served. The good guys arrived  took the cute  mistreated animals from the hands of the evil traffickers  and everyone lived happily ever after.  But did they  Actually  no  and this is where many of our problems begin. Because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals. In Brazil  they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities  in which most of the cases  the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers. In       these centers received        animals  of which        were birds. And the police estimates that we seize only five percent of what's being trafficked. Some lucky ones    and among them  Brad    go to serious rehabilitation centers after that. And in these places they are cared for. They train their flying  they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature  and they are able to socialize with others from the same species. But then what  The Brazil Ornithological Society    so now we're talking only birds    claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature. Therefore  it would be too risky to release these animals  both for the released and for the natural populations. They also claim that we spend too many resources in their rehabilitation. Following this argument  they suggest that all the birds seized from non threatened species should be euthanized. However  this would mean having killed        birds  only in the state of S o Paulo  only in     . But  some researchers  myself included    some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government    believe there is an alternative. We think that if and when the animals meet certain criteria concerning their health  behavior  inferred origin and whatever we know about the natural populations  then technically responsible releases are possible  both for the well being of the individual  and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems  because we will be returning genes for these populations    which could be important for them in facing environmental challenges    and also we could be returning potential seed dispersers  predators  preys  etc. All of these were released by us. On the top  the turtles are just enjoying freedom. On the middle  this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release. And on the bottom  my personal favorite  the little male over there  four hours after his release he was together with a wild female. So  this is not new  people have been doing this around the world. But it's still a big issue in Brazil. We believe we have performed responsible releases. We've registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks. So  these genes are indeed going back to the populations. However this is still a minority for the very lack of knowledge. So  I say   Let's study more  let's shed light on this issue  let's do whatever we can.  I'm devoting my career to that. And I'm here to urge each and every one of you to do whatever is in your reach  Talk to your neighbor  teach your children  make sure your pet is from a legal breeder. We need to act  and act now  before these ones are the only ones left. Thank you very much. So  basically we have public leaders  public officials who are out of control  they are writing bills that are unintelligible  and out of these bills are going to come maybe        pages of regulations  total complexity  which has a dramatically negative impact on our life. If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits  if you're trying to get a small business loan  you face a blizzard of paperwork. What are we going to do about it  I define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity  transparency and empathy  building humanity into communications. I've been simplifying things for    years. I come out of the advertising and design business. My focus is understanding you people  and how you interact with the government to get your benefits  how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with  and how you view brands. So  very quickly  when President Obama said   I don't see why we can't have a one page  plain English consumer credit agreement.  So  I locked myself in a room  figured out the content  organized the document  and wrote it in plain English. I've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country. This is a real thing. Now  I went one step further and said   Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document  Let's go online.  And many people might need help in computation. Working with the Harvard Business School  you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment  If you spent    dollars for a meal  the longer you take to pay out that loan  you see  over a period of time using the minimum payment it's    dollars and    cents. How about that  Do you think your bank is going to show that to people  But it's going to work. It's more effective than just computational aids. And what about terms like  over the limit   Perhaps a stealth thing. Define it in context. Tell people what it means. When you put it in plain English  you almost force the institution to give the people a way  a default out of that  and not put themselves at risk. Plain English is about changing the content. And one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for IBM. It's a grid  it's a calendar. At such and such a date  IBM has responsibilities  you have responsibilities. Received very favorably by business. And there is some good news to report today. Each year  one in    taxpayers receives a notice from the IRS. There are     million letters that go out. Running through this typical letter that they had  I ran it through my simplicity lab  it's pretty unintelligible. All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible. We looked at doing over       letters that cover    percent of their transactions in plain English. They have been tested in the laboratory. When I run it through my lab  this heat mapping shows everything is intelligible. And the IRS has introduced the program. There are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your attention. There is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency  how to mandate simplicity. We see all this complexity. It's incumbent upon us  and this organization  I believe  to make clarity  transparency and empathy a national priority. There is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate. There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible. So  how are we going to change the world  Make clarity  transparency and simplicity a national priority. I thank you. I want to talk about  .  billion years of history in    minutes. That's     million years per minute. Let's start with the first photograph NASA obtained of planet Mars. This is fly by  Mariner IV. It was taken in     . When this picture appeared  that well known scientific journal  The New York Times  wrote in its editorial   Mars is uninteresting. It's a dead world. NASA should not spend any time or effort studying Mars anymore.  Fortunately  our leaders in Washington at NASA headquarters knew better and we began a very extensive study of the red planet. One of the key questions in all of science   Is there life outside of Earth   I believe that Mars is the most likely target for life outside the Earth. I'm going to show you in a few minutes some amazing measurements that suggest there may be life on Mars. But let me start with a Viking photograph. This is a composite taken by Viking in     . Viking was developed and managed at the NASA Langley Research Center. We sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of     . We had four spacecraft  two around Mars  two on the surface    an amazing accomplishment. This is the first photograph taken from the surface of any planet. This is a Viking Lander photograph of the surface of Mars. And yes  the red planet is red. Mars is half the size of the Earth  but because two thirds of the Earth is covered by water  the land area on Mars is comparable to the land area on Earth. So  Mars is a pretty big place even though it's half the size. We have obtained topographic measurements of the surface of Mars. We understand the elevation differences. We know a lot about Mars. Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system  Olympus Mons. Mars has the Grand Canyon of the solar system  Valles Marineris. Very  very interesting planet. Mars has the largest impact crater in the solar system  Hellas Basin. This is       miles across. If you happened to be on Mars when this impactor hit  it was a really bad day on Mars. This is Olympus Mons. This is bigger than the state of Arizona. Volcanoes are important  because volcanoes produce atmospheres and they produce oceans. We're looking at Valles Marineris  the largest canyon in the solar system  superimposed on a map of the United States        miles across. One of the most intriguing features about Mars  the National Academy of Science says one of the    major mysteries of the space age  is why certain areas of Mars are so highly magnetized. We call this crustal magnetism. There are regions on Mars  where  for some reason    we don't understand why at this point    the surface is very  very highly magnetized. Is there water on Mars  The answer is no  there is no liquid water on the surface of Mars today. But there is intriguing evidence that suggests that the early history of Mars there may have been rivers and fast flowing water. Today Mars is very very dry. We believe there's some water in the polar caps  there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole. Here are some recent images. This is from Spirit and Opportunity. These images that show at one time  there was very fast flowing water on the surface of Mars. Why is water important  Water is important because if you want life you have to have water. Water is the key ingredient in the evolution  the origin of life on a planet. Here is some picture of Antarctica and a picture of Olympus Mons  very similar features  glaciers. So  this is frozen water. This is ice water on Mars. This is my favorite picture. This was just taken a few weeks ago. It has not been seen publicly. This is European space agency Mars Express  image of a crater on Mars and in the middle of the crater we have liquid water  we have ice. Very intriguing photograph. We now believe that in the early history of Mars  which is  .  billion years ago   .  billion years ago  Mars was very Earth like. Mars had rivers  Mars had lakes  but more important Mars had planetary scale oceans. We believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere  and this area in blue  which shows a depression of about four miles  was the ancient ocean area on the surface of Mars. Where did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go  Well  we have an idea. This is a measurement we obtained a few years ago from a Mars orbiting satellite called Odyssey. Sub surface water on Mars  frozen in the form of ice. And this shows the percent. If it's a blueish color  it means    percent by weight. Sixteen percent  by weight  of the interior contains frozen water  or ice. So  there is a lot of water below the surface. The most intriguing and puzzling measurement  in my opinion  we've obtained of Mars  was released earlier this year in the magazine Science. And what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane  CH   in the atmosphere of Mars. And you can see there are three distinct regions of methane. Why is methane important  Because on Earth  almost all      .  percent    of the methane is produced by living systems  not little green men  but microscopic life below the surface or at the surface. We now have evidence that methane is in the atmosphere of Mars  a gas that  on Earth  is biogenic in origin  produced by living systems. These are the three plumes  A  B   B . And this is the terrain it appears over  and we know from geological studies that these regions are the oldest regions on Mars. In fact  the Earth and Mars are both  .  billion years old. The oldest rock on Earth is only  .  billion. The reason there is a billion year gap in our geological understanding is because of plate tectonics  The crust of the Earth has been recycled. We have no geological record prior for the first billion years. That record exists on Mars. And this terrain that we're looking at dates back to  .  billion years when Earth and Mars were formed. It was a Tuesday. This is a map that shows where we've put our spacecraft on the surface of Mars. Here is Viking I  Viking II. This is Opportunity. This is Spirit. This is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix  we just put two years ago. Notice all of our rovers and all of our landers have gone to the northern hemisphere. That's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin. There aren't many craters. And that's because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites. But look in the southern hemisphere. In the southern hemisphere there are impact craters  there are volcanic craters. Here's Hellas Basin  a very very different place  geologically. Look where the methane is  the methane is in a very rough terrain area. What is the best way to unravel the mysteries on Mars that exist  We asked this question    years ago. We invited    of the top Mars scientists to the Langley Research Center for two days. We addressed on the board the major questions that have not been answered. And we spent two days deciding how to best answer this question. And the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket powered airplane we call ARES. It's an Aerial Regional scale Environmental Surveyor. There's a model of ARES here. This is a    percent scale model. This airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center. If any place in the world can build an airplane to fly on Mars  it's the Langley Research Center  for almost     years a leading center of aeronautics in the world. We fly about a mile above the surface. We cover hundreds of miles  and we fly about     miles an hour. We can do things that rovers can't do and landers can't do  We can fly above mountains  volcanoes  impact craters  we fly over valleys  we can fly over surface magnetism  the polar caps  subsurface water  and we can search for life on Mars. But  of equal importance  as we fly through the atmosphere of Mars  we transmit that journey  the first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth  we transmit those images back to Earth. And our goal is to inspire the American public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars. But more important we will inspire the next generation of scientists  technologists  engineers and mathematicians. And that's a critical area of national security and economic vitality  to make sure we produce the next generation of scientists  engineers  mathematicians and technologists. This is what ARES looks like as it flies over Mars. We preprogram it. We will fly where the methane is. We will have instruments aboard the plane that will sample  every three minutes  the atmosphere of Mars. We will look for methane as well as other gasses produced by living systems. We will pinpoint where these gases emanate from  because we can measure the gradient where it comes from  and there  we can direct the next mission to land right in that area. How do we transport an airplane to Mars  In two words  very carefully. The problem is we don't fly it to Mars  we put it in a spacecraft and we send it to Mars. The problem is the spacecraft's largest diameter is nine feet  ARES is    foot wingspan     feet long. How do we get it to Mars  We fold it  and we transport it in a spacecraft. And we have it in something called an aeroshell. This is how we do it. And we have a little video that describes the sequence. Video  Seven  six. Green board. Five  four  three  two  one. Main engine start  and liftoff. Joel Levine  This is a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This is the spacecraft taking nine months to get to Mars. It enters the atmosphere of Mars. A lot of heating  frictional heating. It's going    thousand miles an hour. A parachute opens up to slow it down. The thermal tiles fall off. The airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time. It unfolds. The rocket engine begins. We believe that in a one hour flight we can rewrite the textbook on Mars by making high resolution measurements of the atmosphere  looking for gases of biogenic origin  looking for gases of volcanic origin  studying the surface  studying the magnetism on the surface  which we don't understand  as well as about a dozen other areas. Practice makes perfect. How do we know we can do it  Because we have tested ARES model  several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years  under Mars conditions. And  of equal importance is  we test ARES in the Earth's atmosphere  at         feet  which is comparable to the density and pressure of the atmosphere on Mars where we'll fly. Now          feet  if you fly cross country to Los Angeles  you fly        feet. We do our tests at         feet. And I want to show you one of our tests. This is a half scale model. This is a high altitude helium balloon. This is over Tilamook  Oregon. We put the folded airplane on the balloon    it took about three hours to get up there    and then we released it on command at         feet  and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly. And we've done high altitude and low altitude tests  just to perfect this technique. We're ready to go. I have a scale model here. But we have a full scale model in storage at the NASA Langley Research Center. We're ready to go. All we need is a check from NASA headquarters to cover the costs. I'm prepared to donate my honorarium for today's talk for this mission. There's actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing. This is the ARES team  we have about     scientists  engineers  where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory  Goddard Space Flight Center  Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this. It's a large effort. It's all at NASA Langley Research Center. And let me conclude by saying not too far from here  right down the road in Kittyhawk  North Carolina  a little more than     years ago history was made when we had the first powered flight of an airplane on Earth. We are on the verge right now to make the first flight of an airplane outside the Earth's atmosphere. We are prepared to fly this on Mars  rewrite the textbook about Mars. If you're interested in more information  we have a website that describes this exciting and intriguing mission  and why we want to do it. Thank you very much. One day  Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music. And the source was a man  an African American man  charming  rugged  homeless  playing a violin that only had two strings. And I'm telling a story that many of you know  because Steve's columns became the basis for a book  which was turned into a movie  with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez  and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers  the Juilliard trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia. Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard  he suffered a complete breakdown  and    years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men  but how music helped shape that bond  and ultimately was instrumental    if you'll pardon the pun    in helping Nathaniel get off the streets. I met Mr. Ayers in       two years ago  at Walt Disney Concert Hall. He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies  and came backstage and introduced himself. He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series  all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony. And we got talking about music  and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me. Now  I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs  and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life. But as a result now  he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes  the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days  wandering the streets of Skid Row  exposed to its horrors  with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him. And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall    he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes  he was lost. And he was talking about invisible demons and smoke  and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep. And I was afraid  not for myself  but I was afraid that I was going to lose him  that he was going to sink into one of his states  and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy. So  I just started playing. And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. And as I played  I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel's eyes. It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical  a chemical reaction  for which my playing the music was its catalyst. And Nathaniel's manic rage was transformed into understanding  a quiet curiosity and grace. And in a miracle  he lifted his own violin and he started playing  by ear  certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete    Mendelssohn  Tchaikovsky  Sibelius. And we started talking about music  from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms  Bruckner  all the B's  from Bart k  all the way up to Esa Pekka Salonen. And I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music  but he related to this music at a personal level. He spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic. And through playing music and talking about music  this man had transformed from the paranoid  disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming  erudite  brilliant  Juilliard trained musician. Music is medicine. Music changes us. And for Nathaniel  music is sanity. Because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity  into reality. And that is an escape from his tormented state. And I understood that this was the very essence of art. This was the very reason why we made music  that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core  our emotions  and through our artistic lens  through our creativity  we're able to shape those emotions into reality. And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us  inspires and unites us. And for Nathaniel  music brought him back into a fold of friends. The redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him  that recognized his talents and respected him. And I will always make music with Nathaniel  whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row  because he reminds me why I became a musician. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you. Thanks. Robert Gupta. Robert Gupta  I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists. So  please forgive me. You know for me  the interest in contemporary forms of slavery started with a leaflet that I picked up in London. It was the early '  s  and I was at a public event. I saw this leaflet and it said   There are millions of slaves in the world today.  And I thought   No way  no way.  And I'm going to admit to hubris. Because I also  I'm going to admit to you  I also thought   How can I be like a hot shot young full professor who teaches human rights and not know this  So it can't be true.  Well  if you teach  if you worship in the temple of learning  do not mock the gods  because they will take you  fill you with curiosity and desire  and drive you. Drive you with a passion to change things. I went out and did a lit review        articles on the key word  slavery.  Two turned out to be about contemporary    only two. All the rest were historical. They were press pieces and they were full of outrage  they were full of speculation  they were anecdotal    no solid information. So  I began to do a research project of my own. I went to five countries around the world. I looked at slaves. I met slaveholders  and I looked very deeply into slave based businesses because this is an economic crime. People do not enslave people to be mean to them. They do it to make a profit. And I've got to tell you  what I found out in the world in four different continents  was depressingly familiar. Like this  Agricultural workers in Africa  whipped and beaten  showing us how they were beaten in the fields before they escaped from slavery and met up with our film crew. It was mind blowing. And I want to be very clear. I'm talking about real slavery. This is not about lousy marriages  this is not about jobs that suck. This is about people who can not walk away  people who are forced to work without pay  people who are operating      under a threat of violence and have no pay. It's real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history. Now  where is it  Well  this map in the sort of redder  yellower colors are the places with the highest densities of slavery. But in fact that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery. And you might notice that it's only Iceland and Greenland where we can't find any cases of enslavement around the world. We're also particularly interested and looking very carefully at places where slaves are being used to perpetrate extreme environmental destruction. Around the world  slaves are used to destroy the environment  cutting down trees in the Amazon  destroying forest areas in West Africa  mining and spreading mercury around in places like Ghana and the Congo  destroying the coastal ecosystems in South Asia. It's a pretty harrowing linkage between what's happening to our environment and what's happening to our human rights. Now  how on Earth did we get to a situation like this  where we have    million people in slavery in the year       That's double the number that came out of Africa in the entire transatlantic slave trade. Well  it builds up with these factors. They are not causal  they are actually supporting factors. One we all know about  the population explosion  the world goes from two billion people to almost seven billion people in the last    years. Being numerous does not make you a slave. Add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world  caused by civil wars  ethnic conflicts  kleptocratic governments  disease ... you name it  you know it. We understand how that works. In some countries all of those things happen at once  like Sierra Leone a few years ago  and push enormous parts ... about a billion people in the world  in fact  as we know  live on the edge  live in situations where they don't have any opportunity and are usually even destitute. But that doesn't make you a slave either. What it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable into a slave  is the absence of the rule of law. If the rule of law is sound  it protects the poor and it protects the vulnerable. But if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law  then if you can use violence  if you can use violence with impunity  you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery. Well  that is precisely what has happened around the world. Though  for a lot of people  the people who step into slavery today don't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head. They come into slavery because someone has asked them this question. All around the world I've been told an almost identical story. People say   I was home  someone came into our village  they stood up in the back of a truck  they said  'I've got jobs  who needs a job '  And they did exactly what you or I would do in the same situation. They said   That guy looked sketchy. I was suspicious  but my children were hungry. We needed medicine. I knew I had to do anything I could to earn some money to support the people I care about.  They climb into the back of the truck. They go off with the person who recruits them. Ten miles      miles        miles later  they find themselves in dirty  dangerous  demeaning work. They take it for a little while  but when they try to leave  bang   the hammer comes down  and they discover they're enslaved. Now  that kind of slavery is  again  pretty much what slavery has been all through human history. But there is one thing that is particularly remarkable and novel about slavery today  and that is a complete collapse in the price of human beings    expensive in the past  dirt cheap now. Even the business programs have started picking up on this. I just want to share a little clip for you. Daphne  OK. Llively discussion guaranteed here  as always  as we get macro and talk commodities. Continuing here in the studio with our guest Michael O'Donohue  head of commodities at Four Continents Capital Management. And we're also joined by Brent Lawson from Lawson Frisk Securities. Brent Lawson  Happy to be here. D  Good to have you with us  Brent. Now  gentlemen ... Brent  where is your money going this year  BL  Well Daphne  we've been going short on gas and oil recently and casting our net just a little bit wider. We really like the human being story a lot. If you look at a long term chart  prices are at historical lows and yet global demand for forced labor is still real strong. So  that's a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on. D  Michael  what's your take on the people story  Are you interested  Michael O'Donoghue  Oh definitely. Non voluntary labor's greatest advantage as an asset is the endless supply. We're not about to run out of people. No other commodity has that. BL  Daphne  if I may draw your attention to one thing. That is that private equity has been sniffing around  and that tells me that this market is about to explode. Africans and Indians  as usual  South Americans  and Eastern Europeans in particular are on our buy list. D  Interesting. Micheal  bottom line  what do you recommend  MO  We're recommending to our clients a buy and hold strategy. There's no need to play the market. There's a lot of vulnerable people out there. It's very exciting. D  Exciting stuff indeed. Gentlemen  thank you very much. Kevin Bales  Okay  you figured it out. That's a spoof. Though I enjoyed watching your jaws drop  drop  drop  until you got it. MTV Europe worked with us and made that spoof  and they've been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction  which I think is kind of fun. Here's the reality. The price of human beings across the last       years in today's money has averaged about        dollars. Capital purchase items. You can see that the lines cross when the population explodes. The average price of a human being today  around the world  is about    dollars. They are more expensive in places like North America. Slaves cost between       to       dollars in North America  but I could take you places in India or Nepal where human beings can be acquired for five or    dollars. They key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like Styrofoam cups. You buy them cheaply  you use them  you crumple them up  and then when you're done with them you just throw them away. These young boys are in Nepal. They are basically the transport system on a quarry run by a slaveholder. There are no roads there  so they carry loads of stone on their backs  often of their own weight  up and down the Himalaya Mountains. One of their mothers said to us   You know  we can't survive here  but we can't even seem to die either.  It's a horrible situation. And if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this  it's that there are also    in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved    there are ex slaves who are now working to free others. Or  we say  Frederick Douglass is in the house. I don't know if you've ever had a daydream about   Wow. What would it be like to meet Harriet Tubman  What would it be like to meet Frederick Douglass   I've got to say  one of the most exciting parts about my job is that I get to  and I want to introduce you to one of those. His name is James Kofi Annan. He was a slave child in Ghana enslaved in the fishing industry  and he now  after escape and building a new life  has formed an organization that we work closely with to go back and get people out of slavery. This is not James  this is one of the kids that he works with. James Kofi Annan  Video   He was hit with a paddle in the head. And this reminds me of my childhood when I used to work here. KB  James and our country director in Ghana  Emmanuel Otoo are now receiving regular death threats because the two of them managed to get convictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers for the very first time in Ghana for enslaving people  from the fishing industry  for enslaving children. Now  everything I've been telling you  I admit  is pretty disheartening. But there is actually a very positive side to this  and that is this  The    million people who are in slavery today  that's a lot of people  but it's also the smallest fraction of the global population to ever be in slavery. And likewise  the    billion dollars that they generate into the global economy each year is the tiniest proportion of the global economy to ever be represented by slave labor. Slavery  illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our global society. And in a way  without us even noticing  has ended up standing on the precipice of its own extinction  waiting for us to give it a big boot and knock it over. And get rid of it. And it can be done. Now  if we do that  if we put the resources and the focus to it  what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery  Well  first  before I even tell you the cost I've got to be absolutely clear. We do not buy people out of slavery. Buying people out of slavery is like paying a burglar to get your television back  it's abetting a crime. Liberation  however  costs some money. Liberation  and more importantly all the work that comes after liberation. It's not an event  it's a process. It's about helping people to build lives of dignity  stability  economic autonomy  citizenship. Well  amazingly  in places like India where costs are very low  that family  that three generation family that you see there who were in hereditary slavery    so  that granddad there  was born a baby into slavery    but the total cost  amortized across the rest of the work  was about     dollars to bring that family out of slavery and then take them through a two year process to build a stable life of citizenship and education. A boy in Ghana rescued from fishing slavery  about     dollars. In the United States  North America  much more expensive. Legal costs  medical costs ... we understand that it's expensive here  about        dollars. But most of the people in the world in slavery live in those places where the costs are lowest. And in fact  the global average is about what it is for Ghana. And that means  when you multiply it up  the estimated cost of not just freedom but sustainable freedom for the entire    million people on the planet in slavery is something like   .  billion dollars    what Americans spend on potato chips and pretzels  what Seattle is going to spend on its light rail system  usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans  or in the last holiday period when we bought GameBoys and iPods and other tech gifts for people  we spent   .  billion dollars. Intel's fourth quarter earnings    .  billion. It's not a lot of money at the global level. In fact  it's peanuts. And the great thing about it is that it's not money down a hole  there is a freedom dividend. When you let people out of slavery to work for themselves  are they motivated  They take their kids out of the workplace  they build a school  they say   We're going to have stuff we've never had before like three squares  medicine when we're sick  clothing when we're cold.  They become consumers and producers and local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly. That's important  all of that about how we rebuild sustainable freedom  because we'd never want to repeat what happened in this country in     . Four million people were lifted up out of slavery and then dumped. Dumped without political participation  decent education  any kind of real opportunity in terms of economic lives  and then sentenced to generations of violence and prejudice and discrimination. And America is still paying the price for the botched emancipation of     . We have made a commitment that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch  and end up as second class citizens. It's just not going to happen. This is what liberation really looks like. Children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in Ghana  reunited with their parents  and then taken with their parents back to their villages to rebuild their economic well being so that they become slave proof    absolutely unenslaveable. Now  this woman lived in a village in Nepal. We'd been working there about a month. They had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery. They'd just begun to light up a little bit  open up a little bit. But when we went to speak with her  when we took this photograph  the slaveholders were still menacing us from the sidelines. They hadn't been really pushed back. I was frightened. We were frightened. We said to her   Are you worried  Are you upset   She said   No  because we've got hope now. How could we not succeed   she said   when people like you from the other side of the world are coming here to stand beside us   Okay  we have to ask ourselves  are we willing to live in a world with slavery  If we don't take action  we just leave ourselves open to have someone else jerk the strings that tie us to slavery in the products we buy  and in our government policies. And yet  if there's one thing that every human being can agree on  I think it's that slavery should end. And if there is a fundamental violation of our human dignity that we would all say is horrific  it's slavery. And we've got to say  what good is all of our intellectual and political and economic power    and I'm really thinking intellectual power in this room    if we can't use it to bring slavery to an end  I think there is enough intellectual power in this room to bring slavery to an end. And you know what  If we can't do that  if we can't use our intellectual power to end slavery  there is one last question  Are we truly free  Okay  thank you so much. I'm standing in front of you today in all humility  wanting to share with you my journey of the last six years in the field of service and education. And I'm not a trained academic. Neither am I a veteran social worker. I was    years in the corporate world  trying to make organizations profitable. And then in      I started Parikrma Humanity Foundation from my kitchen table. The first thing that we did was walk through the slums. You know  by the way  there are two million people in Bangalore  who live in     slums. We couldn't go to all the slums  but we tried to cover as much as we could. We walked through these slums  identified houses where children would never go to school. We talked to the parents  tried to convince them about sending their children to school. We played with the children  and came back home really tired  exhausted  but with images of bright faces  twinkling eyes  and went to sleep. We were all excited to start  but the numbers hit us then      million children between four to    that should be going to school  but do not      million children who go to school but cannot read      million who cannot do basic maths. We also heard that     billion Indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling. Ninety percent of it was spent on teachers' salary and administrators' salary. And yet  India has nearly the highest teacher absenteeism in the world  with one out of four teachers not going to school at all the entire academic year. Those numbers were absolutely mind boggling  overwhelming  and we were constantly asked   When will you start  How many schools will you start  How many children will you get  How are you going to scale  How are you going to replicate   It was very difficult not to get scared  not to get daunted. But we dug our heels and said   We're not in the number game. We want to take one child at a time and take the child right through school  sent to college  and get them prepared for better living  a high value job.  So  we started Parikrma. The first Parikrma school started in a slum where there were        people living below the poverty line. Our first school was on a rooftop of a building inside the slums  a second story building  the only second story building inside the slums. And that rooftop did not have any ceiling  only half a tin sheet. That was our first school. One hundred sixty five children. Indian academic year begins in June. So  June it rains  so many a times all of us would be huddled under the tin roof  waiting for the rain to stop. My God  What a bonding exercise that was. And all of us that were under that roof are still here together today. Then came the second school  the third school  the fourth school and a junior college. In six years now  we have four schools  one junior college        children coming from    slums and four orphanages. Our dream is very simple  to send each of these kids  get them prepared to be educated but also to live peacefully  contented in this conflict ridden chaotic globalized world. Now  when you talk global you have to talk English. And so all our schools are English medium schools. But they know there is this myth that children from the slums cannot speak English well. No one in their family has spoken English. No one in their generation has spoken English. But how wrong it is. Girl  I like adventurous books  and some of my favorites are Alfred Hitchcock and  unclear  and Hardy Boys. Although they are like in different contexts  one is magical  the other two are like investigation  I like those books because they have something special in them. The vocabulary used in those books and the style of writing. I mean like once I pick up one book I cannot put it down until I finish the whole book. Even if it takes me four and a half hours  or three and half hours to finish my book  I do it. Boy  I did good research and I got the information  on the  world's fastest cars. I like Ducati ZZ     because it is the fastest  the world's fastest bike  and I like Pulsar     DTSI because it is India's fastest bike.  Laughter  Shukla Bose  Well  that girl that you saw  her father sells flowers on the roadside. And this little boy has been coming to school for five years. But isn't it strange that little boys all over the world love fast bikes   Laughter  He hasn't seen one  he hasn't ridden one  of course  but he has done a lot of research through Google search. You know  when we started with our English medium schools we also decided to adopt the best curriculum possible  the ICSE curriculum. And again  there were people who laughed at me and said   Don't be crazy choosing such a tough curriculum for these students. They'll never be able to cope.  Not only do our children cope very well  but they excel in it. You should just come across to see how well our children do. There is also this myth that parents from the slums are not interested in their children going to school  they'd much rather put them to work. That's absolute hogwash. All parents all over the world want their children to lead a better life than themselves  but they need to believe that change is possible. Video   Hindi  SB  We have    percent attendance for all our parents teachers meeting. Sometimes it's even     percent  much more than many privileged schools. Fathers have started to attend. It's very interesting. When we started our school the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register. Now they have started writing their signature. The children have taught them. It's amazing how much children can teach. We have  a few months ago  actually late last year  we had a few mothers who came to us and said   You know  we want to learn how to read and write. Can you teach us   So  we started an afterschool for our parents  for our mothers. We had    mothers who came regularly after school to study. We want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools. Ninety eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics. So  you can imagine how traumatized and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from. We have to send the fathers to de addiction labs and when they come back  most times sober  we have to find a job for them so that they don't regress. We have about three fathers who have been trained to cook. We have taught them nutrition  hygiene. We have helped them set up the kitchen and now they are supplying food to all our children. They do a very good job because their children are eating their food  but most importantly this is the first time they have got respect  and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile. More than    percent of our non teaching staff are all parents and extended families. We've started many programs just to make sure that the child comes to school. Vocational skill program for the older siblings so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school. There is also this myth that children from the slums cannot integrate with mainstream. Take a look at this little girl who was one of the    children from all privileged schools  best schools in the country that was selected for the Duke University talent identification program and was sent to IIM Ahmedabad. Video  Girl  Duke IIMA Camp. Whenever we see that IIMA  it was such a pride for us to go to that camp. Everybody was very friendly  especially I got a lot of friends. And I felt that my English has improved a lot going there and chatting with friends. There they met children who are with a different standard and a different mindset  a totally different society. I mingled with almost everyone. They were very friendly. I had very good friends there  who are from Delhi  who are from Mumbai. Even now we are in touch through Facebook. After this Ahmedabad trip I've been like a totally different mingling with people and all of those. Before that I feel like I wasn't like this. I don't even mingle  or start speaking with someone so quickly. My accent with English improved a lot. And I learned football  volleyball  Frisbee  lots of games. And I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here. Such beautiful food  I enjoyed it. It was so beautiful. I enjoyed eating food like  unclear  would come and ask me   Yes ma'am  what you want   It was so good to hear  SB  This girl was working as a maid before she came to school. And today she wants to be a neurologist. Our children are doing brilliantly in sports. They are really excelling. There is an inter school athletic competition that is held every year in Bangalore  where       children participate from     best schools in the city. We've got the best school award for three years successively. And our children are coming back home with bags full of medals  with lots of admirers and friends. Last year there were a couple of kids from elite schools that came to ask for admissions in our school. We also have our very own dream team. Why is this happening  Why this confidence  Is it the exposure  We have professors from MIT  Berkeley  Stanford  Indian Institute of Science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas  experiments  much beyond the classroom. Art  music are considered therapy and mediums of expression. We also believe that it's the content that is more important. It is not the infrastructure  not the toilets  not the libraries  but it is what actually happens in this school that is more important. Creating an environment of learning  of inquiry  of exploration is what is true education. When we started Parikrma we had no idea which direction we were taking. We didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan. But we know for sure that what we want to do today is take one child at a time  not get bogged with numbers  and actually see the child complete the circle of life  and unleash his total potential. We do not believe in scale because we believe in quality  and scale and numbers will automatically happen. We have corporates that have stood behind us  and we are able to  now  open more schools. But we began with the idea of one child at a time. This is five year old Parusharam. He was begging by a bus stop a few years ago  got picked up and is now in an orphanage  has been coming to school for the last four and a half months. He's in kindergarten. He has learned how to speak English. We have a model by which kids can speak English and understand English in three month's time. He can tell you stories in English of the thirsty crow  of the crocodile and of the giraffe. And if you ask him what he likes to do he will say   I like sleeping. I like eating. I like playing.  And if you ask him what he wants to do  he will say   I want to horsing.  Now   horsing  is going for a horse ride. So  Parusharam comes to my office every day. He comes for a tummy rub  because he believes that will give me luck.  Laughter  When I started Parikrma I began with a great deal of arrogance of transforming the world. But today I have been transformed. I have been changed with my children. I've learned so much from them  love  compassion  imagination and such creativity. Parusharam is Parikrma with a simple beginning but a long way to go. I promise you  Parusharam will speak in the TED conference a few years from now. Thank you.
