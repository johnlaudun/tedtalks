I'll just start talking about the   th century. I hope nobody finds that offensive. I    you know  when I    after I had invented PCR  I kind of needed a change. And I moved down to La Jolla and learned how to surf. And I started living down there on the beach for a long time. And when surfers are out waiting for waves  you probably wonder  if you've never been out there  what are they doing  You know  sometimes there's a         minute break out there when you're waiting for a wave to come in. They usually talk about the   th century. You know  they get a real bad rap in the world. People think they're sort of lowbrows. One day  somebody suggested I read this book. It was called    it was called  The Air Pump   or something like  The Leviathan and The Air Pump.  It was a real weird book about the   th century. And I realized  the roots of the way I sort of thought was just the only natural way to think about things. That    you know  I was born thinking about things that way  and I had always been like a little scientist guy. And when I went to find out something  I used scientific methods. I wasn't real surprised  you know  when they first told me how    how you were supposed to do science  because I'd already been doing it for fun and whatever. But it didn't    it never occurred to me that it had to be invented and that it had been invented only     years ago. You know  it was    like it happened in England  and Germany  and Italy sort of all at the same time. And the story of that  I thought  was really fascinating. So I'm going to talk a little bit about that  and what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do. And it's  it's a kind of    You know  Charles I got beheaded somewhere early in the   th century. And the English set up Cromwell and a whole bunch of Republicans or whatever  and not the kind of Republicans we had. They changed the government  and it didn't work. And Charles II  the son  was finally put back on the throne of England. He was really nervous  because his dad had been  you know  beheaded for being the King of England And he was nervous about the fact that conversations that got going in  like  bars and stuff would turn to    this is kind of    it's hard to believe  but people in the   th century in England were starting to talk about  you know  philosophy and stuff in bars. They didn't have TV screens  and they didn't have any football games to watch. And they would get really pissy  and all of a sudden people would spill out into the street and fight about issues like whether or not it was okay if Robert Boyle made a device called the vacuum pump. Now  Boyle was a friend of Charles II. He was a Christian guy during the weekends  but during the week he was a scientist. Which was    back then it was sort of  you know  well  you know    if you made this thing    he made this little device  like kind of like a bicycle pump in reverse that could suck all the air out of    you know what a bell jar is  One of these things  you pick it up  put it down  and it's got a seal  and you can see inside of it  so you can see what's going on inside this thing. But what he was trying to do was to pump all the air out of there  and see what would happen inside there. I mean  the first    I think one of the first experiments he did was he put a bird in there. And people in the   th century  they didn't really understand the same way we do about you know  this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules  and we breathe it in for a purpose and all that. I mean  fish don't know much about water  and people didn't know much about air. But both started exploring it. One thing  he put a bird in there  and he pumped all the air out  and the bird died. So he said  hmm... He said    he called what he'd done as making    they didn't call it a vacuum pump at the time. Now you call it a vacuum pump  he called it a vacuum. Right  And immediately  he got into trouble with the local clergy who said  you can't make a vacuum. Ah  uh    Aristotle said that nature abhors one. I think it was a poor translation  probably  but people relied on authorities like that. And you know  Boyle says  well  shit. I make them all the time. I mean  whatever that is that kills the bird    and I'm calling it a vacuum. And the religious people said that if God wanted you to make    I mean  God is everywhere  that was one of their rules  is God is everywhere. And a vacuum    there's nothing in a vacuum  so you've    God couldn't be in there. So therefore the church said that you can't make a vacuum  you know. And Boyle said  bullshit. I mean  you want to call it Godless  you know  you call it Godless. But that's not my job. I'm not into that. I do that on the weekend. And like    what I'm trying to do is figure out what happens when you suck everything out of a compartment. And he did all these cute little experiments. Like he did one with    he had a little wheel  like a fan  that was sort of loosely attached  so it could spin by itself. He had another fan opposed to it that he had like a    I mean  the way I would have done this would be  like  a rubber band  and  you know  around a tinker toy kind of fan. I know exactly how he did it  I've seen the drawings. It's two fans  one which he could turn from outside after he got the vacuum established  and he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it  the one fan would no longer turn the other one  right  Something was missing  you know. I mean  these are    it's kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment to show that  but that was what was going on at the time. And like  there was big arguments about it in the    you know  the gin houses and in the coffee shops and stuff. And Charles started not liking that. Charles II was kind of saying  you know  you should keep that    let's make a place where you can do this stuff where people don't get so    you know  we don't want the    we don't want to get the people mad at me again. And so    because when they started talking about religion and science and stuff like that  that's when it had sort of gotten his father in trouble. And so  Charles said  I'm going to put up the money give you guys a building  come here and you can meet in the building  but just don't talk about religion in there. And that was fine with Boyle. He said  OK  we're going to start having these meetings. And anybody who wants to do science is    this is about the time that Isaac Newton was starting to whip out a lot of really interesting things. And there was all kind of people that would come to the Royal Society  they called it. You had to be dressed up pretty well. It wasn't like a TED conference. That was the only criteria  was that you be    you looked like a gentleman  and they'd let anybody could come. You didn't have to be a member then. And so  they would come in and you would do    Anybody that was going to show an experiment  which was kind of a new word at the time  demonstrate some principle  they had to do it on stage  where everybody could see it. So they were    the really important part of this was  you were not supposed to talk about final causes  for instance. And God was out of the picture. The actual nature of reality was not at issue. You're not supposed to talk about the absolute nature of anything. You were not supposed to talk about anything that you couldn't demonstrate. So if somebody could see it  you could say  here's how the machine works  here's what we do  and then here's what happens. And seeing what happens  it was OK to generalize  and say  I'm sure that this will happen anytime we make one of these things. And so you can start making up some rules. You say  anytime you have a vacuum state  you will discover that one wheel will not turn another one  if the only connection between them is whatever was there before the vacuum. That kind of thing. Candles can't burn in a vacuum  therefore  probably sparklers wouldn't either. It's not clear  actually sparklers will  but they didn't know that. They didn't have sparklers. But  they       you can make up rules  but they have to relate only to the things that you've been able to demonstrate. And most the demonstrations had to do with visuals. Like if you do an experiment on stage  and nobody can see it  they can just hear it  they would probably think you were freaky. I mean  reality is what you can see. That wasn't an explicit rule in the meeting  but I'm sure that was part of it  you know. If people hear voices  and they can't see and associate it with somebody  that person's probably not there. But the general idea that you could only    you could only really talk about things in that place that had some kind of experimental basis. It didn't matter what Thomas Hobbes  who was a local philosopher  said about it  you know  because you weren't going to be talking final causes. What's happening here  in the middle of the   th century  was that what became my field    science  experimental science    was pulling itself away  and it was in a physical way  because we're going to do it in this room over here  but it was also what    it was an amazing thing that happened. Science had been all interlocked with theology  and philosophy  and    and    and mathematics  which is really not science. But experimental science had been tied up with all those things. And the mathematics part and the experimental science part was pulling away from philosophy. And    things    we never looked back. It's been so cool since then. I mean  it just    it just    untangled a thing that was really impeding technology from being developed. And  I mean  everybody in this room    now  this is     short years ago. Remember  that's a short time. It was          probably  years ago that most of us  the ancestors of most of us in this room came up out of Africa and turned to the left. You know  the ones that turned to the right  there are some of those in the Japanese translation. But that happened very    a long time ago compared to     short years ago. But in that     years  the place has just undergone a lot of changes. In fact  everybody in this room probably  especially if you picked up your bag    some of you  I know  didn't pick up your bags    but if you picked up your bag  everybody in this room has got in their pocket  or back in their room  something that     years ago  kings would have gone to war to have. I mean  if you can think how important    If you have a GPS system and there are no satellites  it's not going to be much use. But  like    but  you know  if somebody had a GPS system in the   th century some king would have gotten together an army and gone to get it  you know. If that person    Audience  For the teddy bear  The teddy bear  Kary Mullis  They might have done it for the teddy bear  yeah. But    all of us own stuff. I mean  individuals own things that kings would have definitely gone to war to get. And this is just     years. Not a whole lot of people doing this stuff. You know  the important people    you can almost read about their lives  about all the really important people that made advances  you know. And  I mean    this kind of stuff  you know  all this stuff came from that separation of this little sort of thing that we do    now I  when I was a boy was born sort of with this idea that if you want to know something    you know  maybe it's because my old man was gone a lot  and my mother didn't really know much science  but I thought if you want to know something about stuff  you do it    you make an experiment  you know. You get    you get  like    I just had a natural feeling for science and setting up experiments. I thought that was the way everybody had always thought. I thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way. It isn't true. I mean  there's a lot of people    You know  I was one of those scientists that was    got into trouble the other night at dinner because of the post modernism thing. And I didn't mean  you know    where is that lady  Audience  Here. KM  I mean  I didn't really think of that as an argument so much as just a lively discussion. I didn't take it personally  but    I just    I had    I naively had thought  until this surfing experience started me into the   th century  I'd thought that's just the way people thought  and everybody did  and they recognized reality by what they could see or touch or feel or hear. At any rate  when I was a boy  I  like  for instance  I had this    I got this little book from Fort Sill  Oklahoma    This is about the time that George Dyson's dad was starting to blow nuclear    thinking about blowing up nuclear rockets and stuff. I was thinking about making my own little rockets. And I knew that frogs    little frogs    had aspirations of space travel  just like people. And I    I was looking for a    a propulsion system that would like  make a rocket  like  maybe about four feet high go up a couple of miles. And  I mean  that was my sort of goal. I wanted it to go out of sight and then I wanted this little parachute to come back with the frog in it. And    I    I    I got this book from Fort Sill  Oklahoma  where there's a missile base. They send it out for amateur rocketeers  and it said in there do not ever heat a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar. You know  that's what you call a lead. You sort of    now you say  well  let's see if I can get hold of some potassium chlorate and sugar  perchlorate and sugar  and heat it  it would be interesting to see what it is they don't want me to do  and what it is going to    and how is it going to work. And we didn't have    like  my mother presided over the back yard from an upstairs window  where she would be ironing or something like that. And she was usually just sort of keeping an eye on  and if there was any puffs of smoke out there  she'd lean out and admonish us all not to blow our eyes out. That was her    You know  that was kind of the worst thing that could happen to us. That's why I thought  as long as I don't blow my eyes out... I may not care about the fact that it's prohibited from heating this solution. I'm going to do it carefully  but I'll do it. It's like anything else that's prohibited  you do it behind the garage. So  I went to the drug store and I tried to buy some potassium perchlorate and it wasn't unreasonable then for a kid to walk into a drug store and buy chemicals. Nowadays  it's no ma'am  check your shoes. And like    But then it wasn't    they didn't have any  but the guy had    I said  what kind of salts of potassium do you have  You know. And he had potassium nitrate. And I said  that might do the same thing  whatever it is. I'm sure it's got to do with rockets or it wouldn't be in that manual. And so I    I did some experiments. You know  I started off with little tiny amounts of potassium nitrate and sugar  which was readily available  and I mixed it in different proportions  and I tried to light it on fire. Just to see what would happen  if you mixed it together. And it    they burned. It burned kind of slow  but it made a nice smell  compared to other rocket fuels I had tried  that all had sulfur in them. And  it smelt like burnt candy. And then I tried the melting business  and I melted it. And then it melted into a little sort of syrupy liquid  brown. And then it cooled down to a brick hard substance  that when you lit that  it went off like a bat. I mean  the little bowl of that stuff that had cooled down    you'd light it  and it would just start dancing around the yard. And I said  there is a way to get a frog up to where he wants to go. So I started developing    you know  George's dad had a lot of help. I just had my brother. But I    it took me about    it took me about  I'd say  six months to finally figure out all the little things. There's a lot of little things involved in making a rocket that it will actually work  even after you have the fuel. But you do it  by    what I just   you know  you do experiments  and you write down things sometimes  you make observations  you know. And then you slowly build up a theory of how this stuff works. And it was    I was following all the rules. I didn't know what the rules were  I'm a natural born scientist  I guess  or some kind of a throwback to the   th century  whatever. But at any rate  we finally did have a device that would reproduceably put a frog out of sight and get him back alive. And we had not    I mean  we weren't frightened by it. We should have been  because it made a lot of smoke and it made a lot of noise  and it was powerful  you know. And once in a while  they would blow up. But I wasn't worried  by the way  about  you know  the explosion causing the destruction of the planet. I hadn't heard about the    ways that we should be afraid of the    By the way  I could have thought  I'd better not do this because they say not to  you know. And I'd better get permission from the government. If I'd have waited around for that  I would have never    the frog would have died  you know. At any rate  I bring it up because it's a good story  and he said  tell personal things  you know  and that's a personal    I was going to tell you about the first night that I met my wife  but that would be too personal  wouldn't it. So  so I've got something else that's not personal. But that... process is what I think of as science  see  where you start with some idea  and then instead of  like  looking up  every authority that you've ever heard of I    sometimes you do that  if you're going to write a paper later  you want to figure out who else has worked on it. But in the actual process  you get an idea    like  when I got the idea one night that I could amplify DNA with two oligonucleotides  and I could make lots of copies of some little piece of DNA  you know  the thinking for that was about    minutes while I was driving my car  and then instead of going    I went back and I did talk to people about it  but if I'd listened to what I heard from all my friends who were molecular biologists    I would have abandoned it. You know  if I had gone back looking for an authority figure who could tell me if it would work or not  he would have said  no  it probably won't. Because the results of it were so spectacular that if it worked it was going to change everybody's goddamn way of doing molecular biology. Nobody wants a chemist to come in and poke around in their stuff like that and change things. But if you go to authority  and you always don't    you don't always get the right answer  see. But I knew  you'd go into the lab and you'd try to make it work yourself. And then you're the authority  and you can say  I know it works  because right there in that tube is where it happened  and here  on this gel  there's a little band there that I know that's DNA  and that's the DNA I wanted to amplify  so there  So it does work. You know  that's how you do science. And then you say  well  what can make it work better  And then you figure out better and better ways to do it. But you always work from  from like  facts that you have made available to you by doing experiments  things that you could do on a stage. And no tricky shit behind the thing. I mean  it's all    you've got to be very honest with what you're doing if it really is going to work. I mean  you can't make up results  and then do another experiment based on that one. So you have to be honest. And I'm basically honest. I have a fairly bad memory  and dishonesty would always get me in trouble  if I  like    so I've just sort of been naturally honest and naturally inquisitive  and that sort of leads to that kind of science. Now  let's see... I've got another five minutes  right  OK. All scientists aren't like that. You know    and there is a lot    There is a lot    a lot has been going on since Isaac Newton and all that stuff happened. One of the things that happened right around World War II in that same time period before  and as sure as hell afterwards  government got    realized that scientists aren't strange dudes that  you know  hide in ivory towers and do ridiculous things with test tube. Scientists  you know  made World War II as we know it quite possible. They made faster things. They made bigger guns to shoot them down with. You know  they made drugs to give the pilots if they were broken up in the process. They made all kinds of    and then finally one giant bomb to end the whole thing  right  And everybody stepped back a little and said  you know  we ought to invest in this shit  because whoever has got the most of these people working in the places is going to have a dominant position  at least in the military  and probably in all kind of economic ways. And they got involved in it  and the scientific and industrial establishment was born  and out of that came a lot of scientists who were in there for the money  you know  because it was suddenly available. And they weren't the curious little boys that liked to put frogs up in the air. They were the same people that later went in to medical school  you know  because there was money in it  you know. I mean  later  then they all got into business    I mean  there are waves of    going into your high school  person saying  you want to be rich  you know  be a scientist. You know  not anymore. You want to be rich  you be a businessman. But a lot of people got in it for the money and the power and the travel. That's back when travel was easy. And those people don't think    they don't    they don't always tell you the truth  you know. There is nothing in their contract  in fact  that makes it to their advantage always  to tell you the truth. And the people I'm talking about are people that like    they say that they're a member of the committee called  say  the Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change. And they    and they have these big meetings where they try to figure out how we're going to    how we're going to continually prove that the planet is getting warmer  when that's actually contrary to most people's sensations. I mean  if you actually measure the temperature over a period    I mean  the temperature has been measured now pretty carefully for about        years    longer than that it's been measured  but in really nice  precise ways  and records have been kept for    or    years  and in fact  the temperature hadn't really gone up. It's like  the average temperature has gone up a tiny little bit  because the nighttime temperatures at the weather stations have come up just a little bit. But there's a good explanation for that. And it's that the weather stations are all built outside of town  where the airport was  and now the town's moved out there  there's concrete all around and they call it the skyline effect. And most responsible people that measure temperatures realize you have to shield your measuring device from that. And even then  you know  because the buildings get warm in the daytime  and they keep it a little warmer at night. So the temperature has been  sort of  inching up. It should have been. But not a lot. Not like  you know    the first guy    the first guy that got the idea that we're going to fry ourselves here  actually  he didn't think of it that way. His name was Sven Arrhenius. He was Swedish  and he said  if you double the CO  level in the atmosphere  which he thought might    this is in         the temperature ought to go up about  .  degrees  he calculated. He was thinking of the earth as  kind of like  you know  like a completely insulated thing with no stuff in it  really  just energy coming down  energy leaving. And so he came up with this theory  and he said  this will be cool  because it'll be a longer growing season in Sweden  you know  and the surfers liked it  the surfers thought  that's a cool idea  because it's pretty cold in the ocean sometimes  and    but a lot of other people later on started thinking it would be bad  you know. But nobody actually demonstrated it  right  I mean  the temperature as measured    and you can find this on our wonderful Internet  you just go and look for all NASAs records  and all the Weather Bureau's records  and you'll look at it yourself  and you'll see  the temperature has just    the nighttime temperature measured on the surface of the planet has gone up a tiny little bit. So if you just average that and the daytime temperature  it looks like it went up about .  degrees in this century. But in fact  it was just coming up    it was the nighttime  the daytime temperatures didn't go up. So    and Arrhenius' theory    and all the global warmers think    they would say  yeah  it should go up in the daytime  too  if it's the greenhouse effect. Now  people like things that have  like  names like that  that they can envision it  right  I mean    but people don't like things like this  so    most    I mean  you don't get all excited about things like the actual evidence  you know  which would be evidence for strengthening of the tropical circulation in the     s. It's a paper that came out in February  and most of you probably hadn't heard about it.  Evidence for Large Decadal Variability in the Tropical Mean Radiative Energy Budget.  Excuse me. Those papers were published by NASA  and some scientists at Columbia  and Viliki and a whole bunch of people  Princeton. And those two papers came out in Science Magazine  February the first  and these    the conclusion in both of these papers  and in also the Science editor's  like  descriptions of these papers  for  you know  for the quickie  is that our theories about global warming are completely wrong. I mean  what these guys were doing  and this is what    the NASA people have been saying this for a long time. They say  if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere  it isn't going up    it's not going up at all. We've doing it very carefully now for    years  from satellites  and it isn't going up. And in this paper  they show something much more striking  and that was that they did what they call a radiation    and I'm not going to go into the details of it  actually it's quite complicated  but it isn't as complicated as they might make you think it is by the words they use in those papers. If you really get down to it  they say  the sun puts out a certain amount of energy    we know how much that is    it falls on the earth  the earth gives back a certain amount. When it gets warm it generates    it makes redder energy    I mean  like infra red  like something that's warm gives off infra red. The whole business of the global warming    trash  really  is that    if the    if there's too much CO  in the atmosphere  the heat that's trying to escape won't be able to get out. But the heat coming from the sun  which is mostly down in the    it's like     nanometers  which is where it's centered    that goes right through CO . So you still get heated  but you don't dissipate any. Well  these guys measured all of those things. I mean  you can talk about that stuff  and you can write these large reports  and you can get government money to do it  but these    they actually measured it  and it turns out that in the last    years    that's why they say  decadal  there    that the energy    that the level of what they call  imbalance  has been way the hell over what was expected. Like  the amount of imbalance    meaning  heat's coming in and it's not going out that you would get from having double the CO   which we're not anywhere near that  by the way. But if we did  in      or something  have double the CO  as we had in       they say it would be increase the energy budget by about    in other words  one watt per square centimeter more would be coming in than going out. So the planet should get warmer. Well  they found out in this study    these two studies by two different teams    that five and a half watts per square meter had been coming in from             and the place didn't get warmer. So the theory's kaput    it's nothing. These papers should have been called   The End to the Global Warming Fiasco   you know. They're concerned  and you can tell they have very guarded conclusions in these papers  because they're talking about big laboratories that are funded by lots of money and by scared people. You know  if they said  you know what  There isn't a problem with global warming any longer  so we can    you know  they're funding. And if you start a grant request with something like that  and say  global warming obviously hadn't happened... if they    if they    if they actually    if they actually said that  I'm getting out. I'll stand up too  and    They have to say that. They had to be very cautious. But what I'm saying is  you can be delighted  because the editor of Science  who is no dummy  and both of these fairly professional    really professional teams  have really come to the same conclusion and in the bottom lines in their papers they have to say  what this means is  that what we've been thinking  was the global circulation model that we predict that the earth is going to get overheated that it's all wrong. It's wrong by a large factor. It's not by a small one. They just    they just misinterpreted the fact that the earth    there's obviously some mechanisms going on that nobody knew about  because the heat's coming in and it isn't getting warmer. So the planet is a pretty amazing thing  you know  it's big and horrible    and big and wonderful  and it does all kinds of things we don't know anything about. So I mean  the reason I put those things all together  OK  here's the way you're supposed to do science    some science is done for other reasons  and just curiosity. And there's a lot of things like global warming  and ozone hole and you know  a whole bunch of scientific public issues  that if you're interested in them  then you have to get down the details  and read the papers called   Large Decadal Variability in the...  You have to figure out what all those words mean. And if you just listen to the guys who are hyping those issues  and making a lot of money out of it  you'll be misinformed  and you'll be worrying about the wrong things. Remember the    things that are going to get you. The    one of them    And the asteroids is the one I really agree with there. I mean  you've got to watch out for asteroids. OK  thank you for having me here. I'm kind of tired of talking about simplicity  actually  so I thought I'd make my life more complex  as a serious play. So  I'm going to  like  go through some slides from way back when  and walk through them to give you a sense of how I end up here. So  basically it all began with this whole idea of a computer. Who has a computer  Yeah. O.K.  so  everyone has a computer. Even a mobile phone  it's a computer. And    anyone remember this workbook   Instant Activities for Your Apple     free poster in each book  This was how computing began. Don't forget  a computer came out  it had no software. You'd buy that thing  you'd bring it home  you'd plug it in  and it would do absolutely nothing at all. So  you had to program it  and there were great programming  like  tutorials  like this. I mean  this was great. It's  like  you know  Herbie the Apple II. It's such a great way to    I mean  they should make Java books like this  and we've have no problem learning a program. But this was a great  grand time of the computer  when it was just a raw  raw  what is it  kind of an era. And  you see  this era coincided with my own childhood. I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle. Who of you grew up in a family business  suffered the torture  Yes  yes. The torture was good. Wasn't it good torture  It was just life changing  you know. And so  in my life  you know  I was in the tofu  it was a family business. And my mother was a kind of a designer  also. She'd make this kind of  like  wall of tofu cooking  and it would confuse the customers  because they all thought it was a restaurant. A bad sort of branding thing  or whatever. But  anyway  that's where I grew up  in this little tofu factory in Seattle  and it was kind of like this  a small room where I kind of grew up. I'm big there in that picture. That's my dad. My dad was kind of like MacGyver  really  he would invent  like  ways to make things heavy. Like back here  there's like  concrete block technology here  and he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu  because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing  and so you have to have heavy stuff to push out the liquid and make it hard. Tofu comes out in these big batches  and my father would sort of cut them by hand. I can't tell you    family business story  you'd understand this    my father was the most sincere man possible. He walked into a Safeway once on a rainy day  slipped  broke his arm  rushed out  he didn't want to inconvenience Safeway. So  instead  you know  my father's  like  arm's broken for two weeks in the store  and that week    now  those two weeks were when my older brother and I had to do everything. And that was torture  real torture. Because  you see  we'd seen my father taking the big block of tofu and cutting it  like  knife in  zap  zap  zap. We thought  wow. So  the first time I did that  I went  like  whoa  Like this. Bad blocks. But anyways  the tofu to me was kind of my origin  basically. And because working in a store was so hard  I liked going to school  it was like heaven. And I was really good at school. So  when I got to MIT  you know  as most of you who are creatives  your parents all told you not to be creative  right  So  same way  you know  I was good at art and good at math  and my father says  he's    John's good at math. I went to MIT  did my math  but I had this wonderful opportunity  because computers had just become visual. The Apple    Macintosh just came out  I had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT. And it was a time when a guy who  kind of  could cross the two sides    it was a good time. And so  I remember that my first major piece of software was on a direct copy of then Aldus PageMaker. I made a desktop publishing system way back when  and that was  kind of  my first step into figuring out how to    oh  these two sides are kind of fun to mix. And the problem when you're younger    for all you students out there    is  your head gets kind of big really easy. And when I was making icons  I was  like  the icon master  and I was  like  yeah  I'm really good at this  you know. And then luckily  you know  I had the fortune of going to something called a library  and in the library I came upon this very book. I found this book. It's called   Thoughts on Design   by a man named Paul Rand. It's a little slim volume  I'm not sure if you've seen this. It's a very nice little book. It's about this guy  Paul Rand  who was one of the greatest graphic designers  and also a great writer as well. And when I saw this man's work  I realized how bad I was at design  or whatever I called it back then  and I suddenly had a kind of career goal  kind of in hot pursuit. So I kind of switched. I went to MIT  finished. I got my masters  and then went to art school after that. And just began to design stuff  like chopstick wrappers  napkins  menus    whatever I could get a handle on  sort of wheel and deal  move up in the design world  whatever. And isn't it that strange moment when you publish your design  Remember that moment    publishing your designs  Remember that moment  It felt so good  didn't it  So  I was published  you know  so  wow  my design's in a book  you know  After that  things kind of got strange  and I got thinking about the computer  because the computer to me always  kind of  bothered me. I didn't quite get it. And Paul Rand was a kind of crusty designer  you know  a crusty designer  like a good    kind of like a good French bread  You know  he wrote in one of his books   A Yale student once said  'I came here to learn how to design  not how to use a computer.' Design schools take heed.  This is in the '  s  in the great clash of computer non computer people. A very difficult time  actually. And this to me was an important message from Rand. And so I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time. This is the first sort of play thing I did  my own serious play. I built a working version of an Adobe Illustrator ish thing. It looks like Illustrator  it can  like  draw. It was very hard to make this  actually. It took a month to make this part. And then I thought  what if I added this feature  where I can say  this point  you can fly like a bird. You're free  kind of thing. So I could  sort of  change the kind of stability with a little control there on the dial  and I can sort of watch it flip around. And this is in     . And when my professors saw this  they were very upset at me. They were saying  Why's it moving  They were saying  Make it stop now. Now  I was saying  Well  that's the whole point  it's moving. And he says  Well  when's it going to stop  And I said  Never. And he said  Even worse. Stop it now. I started studying this whole idea  of like  what is this computer  It's a strange medium. It's not like print. It's not like video. It lasts forever. It's a very strange medium. So  I went off with this  and began to look for things even more. And so in Japan  I began to experiment with people. This is actually bad  human experiments. I would do these things where I'd have students become pens  there's blue pen  red pen  green pen  black pen. And someone sits down and draws a picture. They're laughing because he said  draw from the middle right to the middle  and he kind of messed up. See  humans don't know how to take orders  the computer's so good at it. This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once  you know  you  pen  do this  and you  pen  do this. And so began to have multiple pens on the page    again  hard to do with our hands. And then someone discovered this  a ha moment  where you could use coordinate systems. We thought  ah  this is when it's going to happen. In the end  he drew a house. It was the most boring thing. It became computerish  we began to think computerish    the X  Y system    and so that was kind of a revelation. And after this I wanted to build a computer out of people  called a human powered computer. So  this happened in     . Sound down  please. It's a computer where the people are the parts. I have behind this wall a disk drive  a CPU  a graphics card  a memory system. They're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard. It's put inside the computer. And that little program's on that cardboard disk. So  she wears the disk  and reads the data off the sectors of the disk  and the computer starts up  it sort of boots up  really. And it's a sort of a working computer. And when I built this computer  I had a moment of    what is it called     the epiphany where I realized that the computer's just so fast. This computer appears to be fast   she's working pretty hard  and people are running around  and we think  wow  this is happening at a fast rate. And this computer's programmed to do only one thing  which is  if you move your mouse  the mouse changes on the screen. On the computer  when you move your mouse  that arrow moves around. On this computer  if you move the mouse  it takes half an hour for the mouse cursor to change. To give you a sense of the speed  the scale  the computer is just so amazingly fast  O.K.  And so  after this I began to do experiments for different companies. This is something I did for Sony in     . It was three Sony  H  devices that responded to sound. So  if you talk into the mike  you'll hear some music in your headphones  if you talk in the phone  then video would happen. So  I began to experiment with industry in different ways with this kind of mixture of skills. I did this ad. I don't believe in this kind of alcohol  but I do drink sometimes. And Chanel. So  getting to do different projects. And also  one thing I realized is that I like to make things. We like to make things. It's fun to make things. And so I never developed the ability to have a staff. I have no staff  it's all kind of made by hand    these sort of broken hands. And these hands were influenced by this man  Mr. Inami Naomi. This guy was my kind of like mentor. He was the first digital media producer in Tokyo. He's the guy that kind of discovered me  and kind of got me going in digital media. He was such an inspirational guy. I remember  like  we'd be in his studio  like  at   a.m.  and then he'd show up from some client meeting. He'd come in and say  you know  If I am here  everything is okay. And you'd feel so much better  you know. And I'll never forget how  like  but    I'll never forget how  like  he had a sudden situation with his    he had an aneurysm. He went into a coma. And so  for three years he was out  and he could only blink  and so I realized at this moment  I thought  wow    how fragile is this thing we're wearing  this body and mind we're wearing  and so I thought  How do you go for it more  How do you take that time you have left and go after it  So  Naomi was pivotal in that. And so  I began to think more carefully about the computer. This was a moment where I was thinking about  so  you have a computer program  it responds to motion    X and Y    and I realized that each computer program has all these images inside the program. So  if you can see here  you know  that program you're seeing in the corner  if you spread it out  it's all these things all at once. It's real simultaneity. It's nothing we're used to working with. We're so used to working in one vector. This is all at the same time. The computer lives in so many dimensions. And also  at the same time I was frustrated  because I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere  and there were these  like   the computer lab   you know  and this is  like  in the late     s  and this is in Basel  a great graphic design school. And here's this  like  dirty  kind of  shoddy  kind of  dark computer room. And I began to wonder  Is this the goal  Is this what we want  you know  And also  I began to be fascinated by machines    you know  like copy machines    and so this is actually in Basel. I noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive    this is  like  a touch screen    and I noticed how you can only touch five places  and so   why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere   became a question. And also  the sound  I discovered I can make my ThinkPad pretend it's a telephone. You get it  No  O.K. And also  I discovered in Logan airport  this was  like  calling out to me. Do you hear that  It's like cows. This is at   a.m. at Logan. So  I was wondering  like  what is this thing in front of me  this computer thing  It didn't make any sense. So  I began to make things again. This is another series of objects made of old computers from my basement. I made    I took my old Macintoshes and made different objects out of them from Tokyo. I began to be very disinterested in computers themselves  so I began to make paintings out of PalmPilots. I made this series of works. They're paintings I made and put a PalmPilot in the middle as a kind of display that's sort of thinking  I'm abstract art. What am I  I'm abstract. And so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction. I began to be fascinated by plastic  so I spent four months making eight plastic blocks perfectly optically transparent  as a kind of release of stress. Because of that  I became interested in blue tape  so in San Francisco  at C.C.  I had a whole exhibition on blue tape. I made a whole installation out of blue tape    blue painters' tape. And at this point my wife kind of got worried about me  so I stopped doing blue tape and began to think  Well  what else is there in life  And so computers  as you know  these big computers  there are now tiny computers. They're littler computers  so the one chip computers  I began to program one chip computers and make objects out of P.C. boards  LEDs. I began to make LED sculptures that would live inside little boxes out of MDF. This is a series of light boxes I made for a show in Italy. Very simple boxes  you just press one button and some LED interaction occurs. This is a series of lamps I made. This is a Bento box lamp  it's sort of a plastic rice lamp  it's very friendly. I did a show in London last year made out of iPods    I used iPods as a material. So I took    iPod Nanos and made a kind of a Nano fish  basically. Recently  this is for Reebok. I've done shoes for Reebok as well  as a kind of a hobby for apparel. So anyways  there are all these things you can do  but the thing I love the most is to experience  taste the world. The world is just so tasty. We think we'll go to a museum  that's where all the tastes are. No  they're all out there. So  this is  like  in front of the Eiffel Tower  really  actually  around the Louvre area. This I found  where nature had made a picture for me. This is a perfect    degree angle by nature. In this strange moment where  like  these things kind of appeared. We all are creative people. We have this gene defect in our mind. We can't help but stop  right  This feeling's a wonderful thing. It's the forever always on museum. This is from the Cape last year. I discovered that I had to find the equation of art and design  which we know as circle triangle square. It's everywhere on the beach  I discovered. I began to collect every instance of circle triangle square. I put these all back  by the way. And I also discovered how . some rocks are twins separated at birth. This is also out there  you know. I'm  like  how did this happen  kind of thing  I brought you guys together again. So  three years ago I discovered  the letters M I T occurring in simplicity and complexity. My alma mater  MIT  and I had this moment    a kind of M. Night Shayamalan moment    where I thought  Whoa  I have to do this. And I went after it with passion. However  recently this RISD opportunity kind of arose    going to RISD    and I couldn't reconcile this real easy  because the letters had told me  MIT forever. But I discovered in the French word raison d' tre. I was  like  aha  wait a second. And there RISD appeared. And so I realized it was O.K. to go. So  I'm going to RISD  actually. Who's a RISD alum out there  RISD alums  Yeah  RISD. There we go  RISD. Woo  RISD. I'm sorry  I'm sorry  Art Center    Art Center is good  too. RISD is kind of my new kind of passion  and I'll tell you a little bit about that. So  RISD is    I was outside RISD  and some student wrote this on some block  and I thought  Wow  RISD wants to know what itself is. And I have no idea what RISD should be  actually  or what it wants to be  but one thing I have to tell you is that although I'm a technologist  I don't like technology very much. It's a  kind of  the qi thing  or whatever. People say  Are you going to bring RISD into the future  And I say  well  I'm going to bring the future back to RISD. There's my perspective. Because in reality  the problem isn't how to make the world more technological. It's about how to make it more humane again. And if anything  I think RISD has a strange DNA. It's a strange exuberance about materials  about the world  a fascination that I think the world needs quite very much right now. So  thank you everyone. Sixty five million years ago  a very important and catastrophic event changed the course of life on land. And although we know that the land animals I'm going to talk about are just the scum of the Earth on the land    the little bits of land floating around    but they are important to us because they're sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters. And these animals disappeared  and a separate life  mammals  radiated out to take their place. And so  we know this in extraordinary detail. And so this is a core from near Bermuda. We know that the tsunamis  the earthquakes  and the things that we've experienced in the entire record of humankind history can't really quite get around the kind of disaster that this represented for the Earth. So even before that impact was known  even before scientists in general came to an agreement over the theory of evolution  scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes actually had divided Earth's life's history into these two episodes  Mesozoic  the middle life  and the Cenozoic  the recent life. And as it turns out  it actually corresponds really nicely with geologic history. So we have a Mesozoic period  an age of fragmentation  and a Cenozoic period  an age of reconnection    South America to North America  India to Asia. And so my work  really  is trying to understand the character of that Mesozoic radiation compared to the Cenozoic radiation to see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals about what life on drifting continents really can tell us about evolution. The work immediately begs the question   Why didn't they go into the waters   I mean  certainly mammals did. This is one example. You can go outside    see many other examples. Within five     million years of the bolide impact we had a whole variety of animals going into the water. Why didn't they do that  Why didn't they hang around in trees at good size  and why didn't they burrow  Why didn't they do all these things  and if they didn't do all these things  what kinds of animals were in those spaces  And if there were no animals in those spaces  what does that tell us about  you know  how evolution works on land  Really interesting questions. I think a lot of it has to do with body size. In fact  I think that most of it has to do with body size    the size you are when you inherit a vacant ecospace from whatever natural disaster. Looking at dinosaur evolution and studying it  digging it up for many years  I end up looking at the mammal radiation  and it seems as though everything is quick time  just like technology  advancing by an order of magnitude. Dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace  an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it. You want to measure it by diversity  You want to measure it by the time it took to reach maximum body size  Yes  they do have larger body size  but many of them are smaller  but we're interested in the time it took them to achieve that. Fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size. And that is    times longer than it took the mammals to achieve maximum body size and invade all those habitats. So there's lessons to learn  and there's lessons to learn from the exception  the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we've made  and many other scholars have made around the world. This slide was shown before. This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx. We now know this transition is the one time that dinosaurs actually went below that body size    we're going to see where they began in a minute    and it is the one time that they rapidly invaded all the habitats I just told you that dinosaurs weren't in. They became marine. We now know them today from the ice caps. There's burrowing birds. They inhabit the trees at all body sizes  and  of course  they inhabit the land. So we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series that later exploded onto the pages of Science and Nature. We called this bird Sinornis. It's a little bit more advanced than Archaeopteryx  and if you go to different layers  you find things that are less advanced than Archaeopteryx  and every grade in between  so that if you find something today  we're usually splitting hairs    or  more appropriately  feathers    as to decide whether it's actually a non avian or an avian. It is the greatest transition that we have  actually  on land from one habitat to another  bar none  to understand how a bony  fairly heavy  kilogram or a couple of kilogram animal could make such a transition. It is really our greatest    one of our greatest    evolutionary sequences. Now  my work began at the beginning. I thought if I'm going to understand dinosaur evolution  I'd have to go back to those beds where they had picked up fragments  go back to a time and a place where the earliest dinosaurs existed. I'd like to call for this little video clip to give you some idea of  sort of  what we face. Normally  we get asked a lot of questions   Well  how do you find fossils in areas that look like this   If we could roll that first video clip. This is sort of a nice helicopter ride through those early beds  and they're located in Northeastern Argentina. And we're coming over a cliff  and at the top of that cliff  dinosaurs had basically taken over. At the bottom of the cliff  we find that they're rare as hens' teeth. That's where dinosaur origins is to be found  at the bottom of the cliff. You go into an area like this  you get a geologic map  you get a topographic map  and the best  most inspired team you can bring to the area. And the rest is up to you. You've got to find fossils. You've got to dig a hole that's usually quite a bit bigger than that to get it out  you've got to climb those cliffs and find  really  everything that existed    not just the dinosaurs  but the entire story. If you're lucky  and you dig a place like that  you actually find the ash bed to dig it  and we did.     million years old  we found what really is the most primitive dinosaur  that's the Ur dinosaur. A three and a half foot thing  beautiful skull  predator  meat eater  a two legged animal. So  all the other dinosaurs that you know  or your kids know  at least  on four legs. This is sort of a look at the skull  and it's an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long. It looks rather bird like because it is. It's bird like and hollow. A predator. Maybe    pounds  or    kilograms. That's where dinosaurs began. That's where the radiation began. That is    times larger than the mammal radiation  which was a four legged radiation. We are extremely dinosaur like  and unusual in our two legged approach to life. Now  if you want to understand what happened then when the continents broke apart  and dinosaurs found    landlubbers  as they are    found themselves adrift. There's some missing puzzle pieces. Most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents  because it was those continents that are least explored. If you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally  you really have to force yourself to go down to the four corners of the Earth    Africa  India  Antarctica  Australia    and start putting together some of these pieces. I've been to some of those continents  but Africa was  in the words of Steven Pinker  was a blank slate  largely. But one with an immense chalkboard in the middle  with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock if you could survive an expedition. There's no roads into the Sahara. It's an enormous place. To be able to excavate the    tons of dinosaurs that we have in the Sahara and take them out  you really have to put together an expedition team that can handle the conditions. Some of them are political. Many of them are physical. Some of them    the most important    are mental. And you really have to be able to withstand conditions    you have to drive into the desert  you will see landscapes in many cases    you can see from what we've discovered    that nobody else has ever seen. And the kinds of teams they bring in  Well  they're composed of people who understand science as adventure with a purpose. They're usually students who've never seen a desert. Some of them are more experienced. Your job as a leader    this is definitely a team sport    your job as a leader is to try to inspire them to do more work than they've ever done in their life under conditions that they can't imagine. So      degrees is normal. The ground surface at        typical. So  you can't leave your normal metal tools out because you'll get a first degree burn if you grab them sometimes. So  you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu. You're really rubbing shoulders with the world's last great nomadic people. These are the Tuareg nomads  and they're living their lives much as they have for centuries. Your job is to excavate things like this in the foreground  and make them enter the pages of history. To do that  you've got to actually transport them thousands of miles out of the desert. We're talking about Ethiopia  but let's talk about Niger    or Niger  in our English language    north of Nigeria    that's where this photograph was taken. Basically you're talking about a country that  when we started working there  did not have container traffic. You transported the bones out yourself to the coast of Africa  onto a boat  if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the Sahara. That's a       mile journey. So enormous excavations and a lot of work  and out of essentially a partial herd of dinosaurs that you saw buried there       tons of material    we erect Jobaria  a sauropod dinosaur like we haven't seen on some other continents. It really is a little bit out of place temporally. It looks nothing like what we would find if we dug in contemporary beds in North America. Here's the animal that was causing it trouble. And  you know  on and on    a whole menagerie. When you pick up something like this    and some of you have had the chance to touch it    this is a piece of history. You're touching something that's     million years old. This is a thumb claw. There it was  moments after it was discovered. It is an incredible view of life  and it really began when we began to understand the depth of time. It's only been with us for less than a century  and in that time  that fourth dimension  when radioactive dating came about  less than a century ago  and we could actually tell how old some of these things were  is probably the most profound transformation  because it changes the way we look at ourselves and the world dramatically. When you pick up a piece of history like that  I think it can transform kids that are possibly interested in science. That's the animal that thumb claw came from  Suchomimus. Here's some others. This is something we found in Morocco  an immense animal. We prototyped by CAT scanning the brain out of this animal. It turns out to have a forebrain one fifteenth the size of a human. This was the cover of Science  because they thought that humans were more intelligent than these animals  but we can see by some in our administration that despite the enormous advantage in brain volume some of the attitudes remain the same. Anyway  smaller raptors. All the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of    all those small animals    they all come from northern continents. This is the first skeleton from a southern continent  and guess what  You start preparing it. It has no big claw on its hind foot. It doesn't look like a Velociraptor. It's really a wholly separate radiation. So what we're trying to piece together here is a story. It involves flying reptiles like this Pterosaur that we reconstructed from Africa. Crocodiles  of course  and that's a nasty one we haven't named yet. And huge things    I mean  this is a lower jaw just laying there in the desert of this enormous crocodile. The crocodile is technically called Sarcosuchus. That's an adult Orinoco crocodile in its jaws. We had to try and reconstruct this. We had to actually look at recent crocodiles to understand how crocodiles scale. Could I have the second little video clip  Now  this field is just    and  of course  science in general    is just    adventure. We had to find and measure the largest crocodiles living today. Narrator  ... as long as their boat. Man  Look at that set of choppers  Yeah  he's a big one. Narrator  If they can just land it  this croc will provide useful data  helping Paul in his quest to understand Sarcosuchus. Man  OK  hand me some more here. Man    OK. Narrator  It falls to Paul to cover its eyes. Man  Watch out  Watch out  No  no  no  no. You're going to have to get on the back legs. Man  I got the back legs. Man    You have the back legs  No  you have the front legs  my friend. I've got it. I've got the back legs. Somebody get the front legs. Paul Sereno  Let's get this tape measure on him. Put it right there. Wow. Sixty five. Wow. That's a big skull. Narrator  Big  but less than half the size of supercroc's skull. Man  Enormous. PS  You've got a ...    foot croc. Man  I knew it was big. PS  Don't get off. You don't get off  but don't worry about me. Narrator  Paul has his data  so they decide to release the animal back into the river. PS  Don't get off  Don't get off  Don't get off  Narrator  Paul has never seen a fossil do that. PS  Okay  when I say three  we move. One  two  three  Whoa  So    there were    Well  you know  the    the fossil record is truly amazing because it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way. We proved with those measurements that crocodiles scaled isometrically. It depended on the shape of their skull  though  so we had to actually get those measurements to be sure that we had reconstructed and could prove to the scientific world that supercroc in fact is a    foot crocodile  probably a male. Anyway  you find other things  too. I'm going to lead an expedition to the Sahara to dig up Africa's largest neolithic site. We found this last year. Two hundred skeletons  tools  jewelry. This is a ceremonial disk. An amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara       years ago is been sitting out there waiting for us to go back. So  really exciting. And then work later is going to take us to Tibet. Now  we normally think of Tibet as a highland. It's really an island continent. It was a precursor to India  a messenger from Gondwana    a lost paradise of dinosaurs isolated for millions of years. No one's found them. We know where they are  and we're going to go and get them next year. They're only between    and        feet  but if you go in the warm part of the year  it's O.K. Now  I tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history so that we can try to understand some basic patterns of evolution. I've talked about a few of them. We really need to take that further. We need to delve into this mass of anatomy that we've been compiling to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means. We can't predict  necessarily  what will happen in evolution  but we can learn some of the rules of the game  and that's really what we're trying to do. With regard to the biogeographic question  the Earth is dividing. These are all landlubbing animals. There's a couple of choices. You get divided  and a continent's division corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree  or you're crafty  and you manage to escape from one to the other and erase that division  or you're living peacefully on each side  and on one side you just go extinct  and you survive on the other side and create a difference. And the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other of those three things  but the paleontologist never found you. And you take those four instances and you realize you have a complex problem. And so  in addition to digging  I think we have some answers from the dinosaur record. I think these dinosaurs migrated    we call it dispersal    around the globe  with the slightest land bridge. They did it within two or three degrees of the pole  to maintain similarity between continents. But when they were divided  indeed they were divided  and we do see the continents carving differences among dinosaurs. But there's one thing that's even more important  and I think that's extinction. We have downgraded this factor. It carves up the history of life  and gives us the differences that we see in the dinosaur world towards the end  right before the bolide impact. The best way to test this is to actually create a model. So if we move back  this is a two dimensional typical tree of life. I want to give you three dimensions. So you see the tree of life  but now I've added the dimension of area. So the tree of life is normally divergence over time. Now we have divergence over time  but we've created the third dimension of area. This is a computer program which has three knobs. We can control those things that we're worried about  extinction  sampling  dispersal    going from one area to another. And ultimately we can control the branching to mimic what we think the continents were like  and run it a thousand times  so we can estimate the parameters  to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not  at least to know the barriers of the problems. So that's a little bit about the science. Today I'm going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here talking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago  which is related to the fact that I never    and actually  in talking to a lot of TEDsters  there's a number of you out there    I don't know that I'd get an answer honestly  if I asked you to raise your hand  but there are a number of you out there that started your scientific  technical  entertainment career as failures  by society's standards  as failures by schools. I was one of those. I was failed by my school    my school failed me. Who's pointing fingers  Several teachers nearly killed me. I found myself in art. I was a total failure in school  not really headed to graduate high school. And I went on    that's my first painting on canvas. I read a dictionary. I got into college. I became an artist. O.K.  and started drawing. It became abstract. I worked up a portfolio  and I was headed to New York. Sometimes I would see bones when there was a body there. Something was going on in the background. I headed to New York to a studio. I took a side trip to the American Museum  and I never recovered. But really it's the same discipline    they're kindred disciplines. I mean  is there anything that is not visualizing what can't be seen  in terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it that's out there  or seeing the distortion that we try to see as evolutionary distortion in one animal to another  This is a very extraordinarily visual. I give you a human face because you're experts at that. It takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs. They're really kindred disciplines. But what we're trying to create in Chicago is a way to get  collect together  those students who are least represented in our science and technology spheres. We all know  and there's been several allusions to it  that we are failing in our ability to produce enough scientists  engineers and technicians. We've known that for a long time. We've gone through the Sputnik phase  and now  as you see the increase in the pace of what we're doing  it becomes even more prominent.  Where are all these people going to come from  And a more general question for our society is  what's going to happen to all the rest that are left behind  What about all the kids like me that were in school    kids like some of you out there    that were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology  Those are the questions I ask. And we talk about Ethiopia  and it's very important. Niger is equally important  and I'm trying desperately to do something in Niger. They have an AIDS problem. I asked    the U.S. State Department asked the government recently  What do you want to do  And they gave them two problems. Dinosaurs was one of them. Give us a museum of dinosaurs  and we will attract tourists  which is our number two industry. And I hope to God the United States government  me  or TED  or somebody helps us do that  because that would be an incredible thing for their country. But when we look back at our own country  we're looking back at our cities  the cities where most of you come from    certainly the city I come from    there's legions of kids out there like these. And the question is    and we started to address this question for centuries    as to how we get these kids involved in science. We've started in Chicago an organization    a non profit organization    called Project Exploration. These are two kids from Project Exploration. We met them in their early stages in high school. They were    failing to poor students  and they are now    one at the University of Chicago  another in Illinois. We've got students at Harvard. We're six years old. And we created a track record. Because when you go out there as a scholar  and you try to find out longitudinal studies  track records like that  there essentially are very few  if none. So  we've created an incredible track record of     percent graduation     percent going to college  many first generation     percent of those choosing science as a career. It's an impressive track record  and so we look back and we say  well  we didn't really exactly work this out theoretically from the start  but when we look back  there are theoretical movements in science education. It's gone through science as an inquiry  which was a big advance  and Dewey back at Chicago    you learn by doing. To    you learn by envisioning yourself as a scientist  and then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist. The next step is to learn the capability to make yourself a scientist. You have to have those steps. If you have    It's easy to get kids interested in science. It's hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist  which involves standing up in front of people like we're doing here at this symposium and presenting something as a knowledgeable person  and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist and giving yourself the tools to pursue that. And so  that's what we're going to do. We're planning a permanent home in Chicago. We have lots of ideas  but I guarantee you this one thing    and I've talked to some people here at TED    it's not going to look like anything you've seen before. It's going to be part school  part museum hall  part conservatory  part zoo  and part of an answer to the problem of how you interest kids in science. Thank you very much. Many of you could ask the question  you know  why is a flying car  or maybe more accurately  a roadable aircraft  possible at this time  A number of years ago  Mr. Ford predicted that flying cars of some form would be available. Now     years later  I'm here to tell you why it's possible. When I was about five years old  not very much    about a year after Mr. Ford made his predictions  I was living in a rural part of Canada  on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area. Getting to school  for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age  through the Canadian winter  was not a pleasant experience. It was a trying and scary thing for a young kid to be going through. At the end of my first year in school  in the summer of that year  I discovered a couple hummingbirds that were caught in a shed near my home. They'd worn themselves out  beating themselves against the window  and  well  they were easy to capture. I took them outside and as I let them go  that split second  even though they were very tired  that second I let them go they hovered for a second  then zipped off into the distance. I thought  what a great way to get to school. For a kid at that age  this was like infinite speed  disappearing  and I was very inspired by that. And so the next    over the next six decades  believe it or not  I've built a number of aircraft  with the goal of creating something that could do for you  or me  what the hummingbird does  and give you that flexibility. I've called this vehicle  generically  a volantor  after the Latin word  volant   meaning  to fly in a light  nimble manner. Volantor like helicopter  perhaps. The FAA  the controlling body above all  calls it a  powered lift aircraft.  And they've actually issued a pilot's license    a powerlift pilot's license    for this type of aircraft. It's closer than you think. It's kind of remarkable when you consider that there are no operational powered lift aircraft. So for once  perhaps  the government is ahead of itself. The press calls my particular volantor a  Skycar.  This is a little bit earlier version of it  that's why it's given the X designation  but it's a four passenger aircraft that could take off vertically  like a helicopter    therefore it doesn't need an airfield. On the ground  it's powered electrically. It's actually classified as a motorcycle because of the three wheels  which is a great asset because it allows you  theoretically  to use this on the highways in most states  and actually in all cities. So that's an asset because if you've got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile  forget it    you're never going to fly it. One could say that a helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does  and gets around in much the same way  and it's true  but a helicopter is a very complex device. It's expensive    so expensive that very few people could own or use it. It's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity  as a series of parts    a large number of parts    flying in formation. Another difference  and I have to describe this  because it's very personal  another great difference between the helicopter and the volantor    in my case the Skycar volantor    is the experience that I've had in flying both of those. In a helicopter you feel    and it's still a remarkable sensation    you feel like you're being hauled up from above by a vibrating crane. When you get in the Skycar    and I can tell you  there's only one other person that's flown it  but he had the same sensation    you really feel like you're being lifted up by a magic carpet  without any vibration whatsoever. The sensation is unbelievable. And it's been a great motivator. I only get to fly this vehicle occasionally  and only when I can persuade my stockholders to let me do so  but it's still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time. What we really need is something to replace the automobile for those    plus mile trips. Very few people realize that    mile plus trips make up    percent of the miles traveled in America. If we can get rid of that  then the highways will now be useful to you  as contrasted by what's happening in many parts of the world today. On this next slide  is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure  because whether I give you a perfect Skycar  the perfect vehicle for use  it's going to have very little value to you unless you've got a system to use it in. I'm sure any of you have asked the question  yeah  are there great things up there    what am I going to do  get up there  It's bad enough on a highway  what's it going to be like to be in the air  This world that you're going to be talking about tomorrow is going to be completely integrated. You're not going to be a pilot  you're going to be a passenger. And it's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward. I can tell you  technically we can build Skycars    my God  we went to the moon  The technology there was much more difficult than what I'm dealing with here. But we have to have these priority changes  we have to have infrastructure to go with this. Historically you see that we got around     years ago by canals  and as that system disappeared  were replaced by railroads. As that disappeared we came in with highways. But if you look at that top corner    the highway system    you see where we are today. Highways are no longer being built  and that's a fact. You won't see any additional highways in the next    years. However  the next    years  if like the last    years  we're going to see    percent more traffic. And where is that going to lead you to  So the issue then  I've often asked  is when is it going to happen  When are we going to be able to have these vehicles  And of course  if you ask me  I'm going to give you a really optimistic view. After all  I've been spending    years here believing it's going to happen tomorrow. So  I'm not going to quote myself on this. I'd prefer to quote someone else  who testified with me before Congress  and in his position as head of NASA put forward this particular vision of the future of this type of aircraft. Now I would argue  actually  if you look at the fact that on the highways today  you're only averaging about    miles per hour    on average  according to the DOT    the Skycar travels at over     miles an hour  up to        feet. And so  in effect  you could see perhaps a tenfold increase in the ability to get around as far as speed is concerned. Unbeknownst to many of you  the highway in the sky that I'm talking about here has been under construction for    years. It makes use of the GPS    you're familiar with GPS in your automobile  but you may not be familiar with the fact that there's a GPS U.S.  there's a Russian GPS  and there's a new GPS system going to Europe  called Galileo. With those three systems  you have what is always necessary    a level of redundancy that says  if one system fails  you'll still have a way to make sure that you're being controlled. Because if you're in this world  where computers are controlling what you're doing  it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you. How would a trip in a Skycar work  Well  you can't right now take off from your home because it's too noisy. I mean to be able to take off from your home  you'd have to be extremely quiet. But it's still fairly quiet. You'd motor  electrically  to a vertiport  which may be a few blocks  maybe even a few miles away. This is clearly  as I said earlier  a roadable aircraft  and you're not going to spend that much time on the road. After all  if you can fly like that  why are you going to drive around on a highway  Go to a local vertiport  plug in your destination  delivered almost like a passenger. You can play computer games  you can sleep  you can read on the way. This is the world    there won't be you as a pilot. And I know the pilots in the audience aren't going to like that    and I've had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there  flying around and experiencing that. And of course  I suppose like recreational parks you can still do that. But the vehicle itself is going to be a very  very controlled environment. Or it's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system. We flew the first vehicle for the international press in       when I really got it started. I was a professor at the U.C. Davis System  and I got a lot of excitement around this  and I was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time. And then through the various years we invented various vehicles. Actually the critical point was in       when we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle    how completely stable it was in all circumstances  which is of course very critical. Still not a practical vehicle during all of this  but moving in the right direction  we believe. Finally  in the early part of    or actually the middle of       we flew the        M     which was the four passenger vehicle. In this case here  we're flying it remotely  as we always did at the beginning. And we had very small power plants in it at this time. We are now installing larger powerplants  which will make it possible for me to get back on board. A vertical takeoff aircraft is not the safest vehicle during the test flight program. There's an old adage that applied for the years between     s and     s  when every aeronautical company was working on vertical takeoff aircraft. A vertical takeoff aircraft needs an artificial stabilization system    that's essential. At least for the hover  and the low speed flight. If that single stability system  that brain that flies that aircraft  fails  or if the engine fails  that vehicle crashes. There is no option to that. And the adage that I'm referring to  that applied at that time  was that nothing comes down faster than a VTOL aircraft upside down. That's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots. In fact  the aircraft companies gave up on vertical takeoff aircraft more or less for a number of years. And there's really only one operational aircraft in the world today that's a vertical takeoff aircraft    as distinct from a helicopter    and that's the Hawker Harrier jump jet. A vertical takeoff aircraft  like the hummingbird  has a very high metabolism  which means it requires a lot of energy. Getting that energy is very  very difficult. It all comes down to that power plant    how to get a large amount of power in a small package. Fortunately  Dr. Felix Wankel invented the rotary engine. A very unique engine    it's round  it's small  it's vibration free. It fits exactly where we need to fit it  right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system    very critical. In fact that engine    for those who are into the automobile    know that it recently is applied to the RX     the Mazda. And that sportscar won Sports Car of the Year. Wonderful engine. In that application  it generates one horsepower per pound  which is twice as good as your car engine today  but only half of what we need. My company has spent    years and many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine  which was invented in the late '  s  and getting it to the point that we get over two horsepower per pound  reliably  and critical. We actually get     horsepower into one cubic foot. We have eight engines in this vehicle. We have four computers. We have two parachutes. Redundancy is the critical issue here. If you want to stay alive you've got to have backups. And we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine  and continued to hover. The computers back up each other. There's a voting system    if one computer is not agreeing with the other three  it's kicked out of the system. And then you have three    you still have the triple redundancy. If one of those fails  you still have a second chance. If you stick around  then good luck. There won't be a third chance. The parachutes are there    hopefully  more for psychological than real reasons  but they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that. I'd like to show you an animation in this next one  which is one element of the Skycar's use  but it's one that demonstrates how it could be used. You could think of it personally in your own terms  of how you might use it. Video  Skycar dispatched  launch rescue vehicle for San Francisco. Paul Moller  I believe that personal transportation in something like the Skycar  probably in another volantor form as well  will be a significant part of our lives  as Dr. Goldin says  within the next    years. And it's going to change the demographics in a very significant way. If you can live    miles from San Francisco and get there in    minutes  you're going to sell your         dollar apartment  buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain  buy a Skycar  which I think would be priced at that time perhaps in the area of         dollars  put money in the bank ... that's a very significant incentive for getting out of San Francisco. But you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell. Developing the Skycar has been a real challenge. Obviously I'm dependent on a lot of other people believing in what I'm doing    both financially and in technical help. And that has    you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you're doing  and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing. I characterized this emerging technology in an aphorism  as it's described  which really talks about what I've experienced  and I'm sure what other people may have experienced in emerging technologies. There's an interesting poll that came out recently under NAS    I think it's MSNBC    in which they asked the question   Are you in the market for a volantor   Twenty three percent said   Yes  as soon as possible.  Forty seven percent    yes  as soon as they could    price could come down. Twenty three percent said   As soon as it's proven safe.  Only seven percent said that they wouldn't consider buying a Skycar. I'm encouraged by that. At least it makes me feel like  to some extent  it is becoming self evident. That we need an alternative to the automobile  at least for those    mile trips and more  so that the highways become usable in today's world. Thank you. What I thought I would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that's tracked by architecture. What's interesting about architects is  we always have tried to justify beauty by looking to nature  and arguably  beautiful architecture has always been looking at a model of nature. So  for roughly     years  the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture  because the nose was one fifth of your head  or because your head was one seventh of your body. And the reason that that was the model of beauty and of nature was because the decimal point had not been invented yet    it wasn't the   th century    and everybody had to dimension a building in terms of fractions  so a room would be dimensioned as one fourth of a facade  the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as    units  and you would get down to the small elements by fractional subdivision  finer and finer and finer. In the   th century  the decimal point was invented  architects stopped using fractions  and they had a new model of nature. So  what's going on today is that there's a model of natural form which is calculus based and which is using digital tools  and that has a lot of implications to the way we think about beauty and form  and it has a lot of implications in the way we think about nature. The best example of this would probably be the Gothic  and the Gothic was invented after the invention of calculus  although the Gothic architects weren't really using calculus to define their forms. But what was important is  the Gothic moment in architecture was the first time that force and motion was thought of in terms of form. So  examples like Christopher Wren's King's Cross  you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting get articulated as lines  so you're really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form. Much later  Robert Maillart's bridges  which optimize structural form with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola. The Hanging Chain models of Antonio Gaudi  the Catalan architect. The end of the   th century  beginning of the   th century  and how that Hanging Chain model translates into archways and vaulting. So  in all of these examples  structure is the determining force. Frei Otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams and foam bubble models to generate his Mannheim Concert Hall. Interestingly  in the last    years Norman Foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model to generate the roof of the National Gallery  with the structural engineer Chris Williams. In all these examples  there's one ideal form  because these are thought in terms of structure. And as an architect  I've always found these kinds of systems very limiting  because I'm not interested in ideal forms and I'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment. So  what I thought I would bring up is another component that needs to be thought of  whenever you think about nature  and that's basically the invention of generic form in genetic evolution. My hero is actually not Darwin  it's a guy named William Bateson  father of Greg Bateson  who was here for a long time in Monterey. And he was what you'd call a teratologist  he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations to find rules and laws  rather than looking at the norms. So  instead of trying to find the ideal type or the ideal average  he'd always look for the exception. So  in this example  which is an example of what's called Bateson's Rule  he has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb. When I first saw this image     years ago  I actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time. Beautiful  because it has symmetry. So  what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations  instead of having a thumb  you would either get another opposable thumb  or you would get four fingers. So  the mutations reverted to symmetry. And Bateson invented the concept of symmetry breaking  which is that wherever you lose information in a system  you revert back to symmetry. So  symmetry wasn't the sign of order and organization    which is what I was always understanding  and as is an architect    symmetry was the absence of information. So  whenever you lost information  you'd move to symmetry  whenever you added information to a system  you would break symmetry. So  this whole idea of natural form shifted at that moment from looking for ideal shapes to looking for a combination of information and generic form. You know  literally after seeing that image  and finding out what Bateson was working with  we started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and branching to start to think about architectural form. To just talk for a minute about the digital mediums that we're using now and how they integrate calculus  the fact that they're calculus based means that we don't have to think about dimension in terms of ideal units or discreet elements. So  in architecture we deal with big assemblies of components  so there might be up to  say         pieces of material in this room you're sitting in right now that all need to get organized. Now  typically you'd think that they would all be the same  like  the chairs you're sitting in would all be the same dimension. You know  I haven't verified this  but it's the norm that every chair would be a slightly different dimension  because you'd want to space them all out for everybody's sight lines. The elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting  they're all losing their modular quality  and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions. That's because we're all using calculus tools for manufacturing and for design. Calculus is also a mathematics of curves. So  even a straight line  defined with calculus  is a curve. It's just a curve without inflection. So  a new vocabulary of form is now pervading all design fields  whether it's automobiles  architecture  products  etc.  it's really being affected by this digital medium of curvature. The intricacies of scale that come out of that    you know  in the example of the nose to the face  there's a fractional part to whole idea. With calculus  the whole idea of subdivision is more complex  because the whole and the parts are one continuous series. It's too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus  so I brought some images to just describe how that works. This is a Korean church that we did in Queens. And in this example  you can see that the components of this stair are repetitive  but they're repetitive without being modular. Each one of the elements in this structure is a unique distance and dimension  and all of the connections are unique angles. Now  the only way we could design that  or possibly construct it  is by using a calculus based definition of the form. It also is much more dynamic  so that you can see that the same form opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it  because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it. So the same space that appears to be a kind of closed volume  when seen from the other side becomes a kind of open vista. And you also get a sense of visual movement in the space  because every one of the elements is changing in a pattern  so that pattern leads your eye towards the altar. I think that's one of the main changes  also  in architecture  that we're starting to look now not for some ideal form  like a Latin cross for a church  but actually all the traits of a church  so  light that comes from behind from an invisible source  directionality that focuses you towards an altar. It turns out it's not rocket science to design a sacred space. You just need to incorporate a certain number of traits in a very kind of genetic way. So  these are the different perspectives of that interior  which has a very complex set of orientations all in a simple form. In terms of construction and manufacturing  this is a kilometer long housing block that was built in the '  s in Amsterdam. And here we've broken the     apartments up into small neighborhoods  and differentiated those neighborhoods. I won't go into too much description of any of these projects  but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building are all held up by     structural trusses. Because we're using escalators to move people  all of these trusses are picking up diagonal loads. So  every one of them is a little bit different shaped as you move down the length of the building. So  working with Bentley and MicroStation  we've written a custom piece of software that networks all of the components together into these chunks of information  so that if we change any element along the length of the building  not only does that change distribute through each one of the trusses  but each one of the trusses then distributes that information down the length of the entire facade of the building. So it's a single calculation for every single component of the building that we're adding onto. So  it's tens of millions of calculations just to design one connection between a piece of structural steel and another piece of structural steel. But what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components  one to another. This idea has  kind of  brought me into doing some product design  and it's because design firms that have connections to architects  like  I'm working with Vitra  which is a furniture company  and Alessi  which is a houseware company. They saw this actually solving a problem  this ability to differentiate components but keep them synthetic. So  not to pick on BMW  or to celebrate them  but take BMW as an example. They have to  in       have a distinct identity for all their models of cars. So  the     series  or whatever their newest car is  the     series that's coming out  has to look like the     series  at the other end of their product line  so they need a distinct  coherent identity  which is BMW. At the same time  there's a person paying        dollars for a     series car  and a person paying        dollars for a     series  and that person paying more than double doesn't want their car to look too much like the bottom of the market car. So they have to also discriminate between these products. So  as manufacturing starts to allow more design options  this problem gets exacerbated  of the whole and the parts. Now  as an architect  part to whole relationships is all I think about  but in terms of product design it's becoming more and more of an issue for companies. So  the first kind of test product we did was with Alessi  which was for a coffee and tea set. It's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set  we knew that at the beginning. So  I actually went to some people I knew down south in San Diego  and we used an exploded titanium forming method that's used in the aerospace industry. Basically what we can do  is just cut a graphite mold  put it in an oven  heat it to       degrees  gently inflate titanium that's soft  and then explode it at the last minute into this form. But what's great about it is  the forms are only a few hundred dollars. The titanium's several thousand dollars  but the forms are very cheap. So  we designed a system here of eight curves that could be swapped  very similar to that housing project I showed you  and we could recombine those together  so that we always had ergonomic shapes that always had the same volume and could always be produced in the same way. That way  each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars  and get incredible variation in the components. And this is one of those examples of the sets. So  for me  what was important is that this coffee set    which is just a coffee pot  a teapot  and those are the pots sitting on a tray    that they would have a coherence    so  they would be Greg Lynn Alessi coffee pots    but that everyone who bought one would have a one of a kind object that was unique in some way. To go back to architecture  what's organic about architecture as a field  unlike product design  is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm. Like  we have to design things which are coherent as a single object  but also break down into small rooms and have an identity of both the big scale and the small scale. Architects tend to work with signature  so that an architect needs a signature and that signature has to work across the scale of houses up to  say  skyscrapers  and that problem of signatures is a thing we're very good at maintaining and working with  and intricacy  which is the relationship of  say  the shape of a building  its structure  its windows  its color  its pattern. These are real architectural problems. So  my kind of hero for this in the natural world are these tropical frogs. I got interested in them because they're the most extreme example of a surface where the texture and the    let's call it the decoration    I know the frog doesn't think of it as decoration  but that's how it works    are all intricately connected to one another. So a change in the form indicates a change in the color pattern. So  the pattern and the form aren't the same thing  but they really work together and are fused in some way. So  when doing a center for the national parks in Costa Rica  we tried to use that idea of a gradient color and a change in texture as the structure moves across the surface of the building. We also used a continuity of change from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum  so it's all one continuous change in the massing  but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms. In a housing project in Valencia  Spain  we're doing  the different towers of housing fused together in shared curves so you get a single mass  like a kind of monolith  but it breaks down into individual elements. And you can see that that change in massing also gives all    of the apartments a unique shape and size  but always within a  kind of  controlled limit  an envelope of change. I work with a group of other architects. We have a company called United Architects. We were one of the finalists for the World Trade Center site design. And I think this just shows how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large scale construction. We wanted to make a kind of Gothic cathedral around the footprints of the World Trade Center site. And to do that  we tried to connect up the five towers into a single system. And we looked at  from the     s on  there were numerous examples of other architects trying to do the same thing. We really approached it at the level of the typology of the building  where we could build these five separate towers  but they would all join at the   th floor and make a kind of single monolithic mass. With United Architects  also  we made a proposal for the European Central Bank headquarters that used the same system  but this time in a much more monolithic mass  like a sphere. But again  you can see this  kind of  organic fusion of multiple building elements to make a thing which is whole  but breaks down into smaller parts  but in an incredibly organic way. Finally  I'd like to just show you some of the effects of using digital fabrication. About six years ago  I bought one of these CNC mills  to just replace  kind of  young people cutting their fingers off all the time building models. And I also bought a laser cutter and started to fabricate within my own shop  kind of  large scale building elements and models  where we could go directly to the tooling. What I found out is that the tooling  if you intervened in the software  actually produced decorative effects. So  for these interiors  like this shop in Stockholm  Sweden  or this installation wall in the Netherlands at the Netherlands Architecture Institute  we could use the texture that the tool would leave to produce a lot of the spatial effects  and we could integrate the texture of the wall with the form of the wall with the material. So  in vacuum formed plastic  in fiberglass  and then even at the level of structural steel  which you think of as being linear and modular. The steel industry is so far ahead of the design industry that if you take advantage of it you can even start to think of beams and columns all rolled together into a single system which is highly efficient  but also produces decorative effects and formal effects that are very beautiful and organic. Thanks very much. I was listed on the online biography that said I was a design missionary. That's a bit lofty  I'm really more of something like a street walker. I spend a lot of time in urban areas looking for design  and studying design in the public sector. I take about       photographs a year  and I thought that I would edit from these  and try to come up with some images that might be appropriate and interesting to you. And I used three criteria  the first was  I thought I'd talk about real design within reach  design that's free  not design not quite within reach  as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors  but stuff that you can find on the streets  stuff that was free  stuff that was available to all people  and stuff that probably contains some other important messages. I'll use these sidewalks in Rio as an example. A very common public design done in the '  s. It's got a nice kind of flowing  organic form  very consistent with the Brazilian culture    I think good design adds to culture. Wholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York. But I think these are my sort of information highways  I live in much more of an analog world  where pedestrian traffic and interaction and diversity exchange  and where I think the simple things under our feet have a great amount of meaning to us. How did I get started in this business  I was a ceramic designer for about    years  and just loved utilitarian form    simple things that we use every day  little compositions of color and surface on form. This led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach  a company dealing with simple forms  making good designers available to us  and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well  and it seems to have worked. A couple of years into the process  I spent a lot of time in Europe traveling around  looking for design. And I had a bit of a wake up call in Amsterdam  I was there going into the design stores  and mixing with our crowd of designers  and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff pretty much looked the same  and the effect of globalization has had that in our community also. We know a lot about what's going on with design around the world  and it's getting increasingly more difficult to find design that reflects a unique culture. I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam and I recognized  you know  the big story from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores  it's what's out on the streets  and maybe it's self explanatory  but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism  that's preserved its kind of architecture and character  and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights are protected. And I write a newsletter that goes out every week  and I wrote an article about this  and it got such enormous response that I realized that design  that common design  that's in the public area means a lot to people  and establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog. I then kind of thought about the other cities in Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design  like Basel  where Vitra is located  or in northern Italy    all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles  and where pedestrian areas    and I came to the conclusion that perhaps there was something about these important design centers that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic  and I'm sure the skeptic eye would say  no  the correlation there is that there are universities and schools where people can't afford cars  but it did seem that in many of these areas pedestrian traffic was protected. You wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike  a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum. But I began looking at design in a place like Amsterdam and recognized  you know  the first job of design is to serve a social purpose. And so I look at this bike as not being a designer bike  but being a very good example of design. And since that time in Amsterdam  I spent an increasing amount of time in the cities  looking at design for common evidence of design that really isn't under so much of a designer's signature. I was in Buenos Aires very recently  and I went to see this bridge by Santiago Calatrava. He's a Spanish architect and designer. And the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge    I love bridges  metaphorically and symbolically and structurally    and it was a bit of a disappointment  because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it  it really wasn't in use. And I recognized that oftentimes design  when you're set up to see design  it can be a bit of a letdown. But there were lots of other things going on in this area  it was a kind of construction zone  a lot of buildings were going up. And  approaching a building from a distance  you don't see too much  you get a little closer  and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something. But to me it was an example of industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation and a nice little still life    kind of unintended piece of design. And going a little closer  you get a different perspective. I find these little vignettes  these little accidental pieces of design  to be refreshing. They give me  I don't know  a sense of correctness in the world and some visual delight in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple industrial scaffolding that is there to serve. Down the road  there was another building  a nice visual structure  horizontal  vertical elements  little decorative lines going across  these magenta squiggles  the workmen being reduced to decorative elements  just a nice  kind of  breakup of the urban place. And  you know  that no longer exists. You've captured it for a moment  and finding this little still life's like listening to little songs or something  it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure. Antoine Predock designed a wonderful ball stadium in San Diego called Petco Park. A terrific use of local materials  but inside you could find some interior compositions. Some people go to baseball stadiums to look at games  I go and see design relationships. Just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture  and the way that the trees form vertical elements. Red is a color in the landscape that is often on stop signs. It takes your attention  it has a great amount of emotion  it stares back at you the way that a figure might. Just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in Italy. Construction site in New York  red having this kind of emotional power that's almost an equivalent with the way in which    cuteness of puppies and such. Side street in Italy. Red drew me into this little composition  optimistic to me in the sense that maybe the public service's mailbox  door service  plumbing. It looks as if these different public services work together to create some nice little compositions. In Italy  you know  almost everything  kind of  looks good. Simple menus put on a board  achieving  kind of  the sort of balance. But I'm convinced that it's because you're walking around the streets and seeing things. Red can be comical  it can draw your attention to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant suffering from bad civic planning in Havana. Color can animate simple blocks  simple materials  walking in New York  I'll stop. I don't always know why I take photographs of things. A nice visual composition of symmetry. Curves against sharp things. It's a comment on the way in which we deal with public seating in the city of New York. I've come across some other just  kind of  curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations  but    these things amuse me. Sometimes a trash can    this is just in the street in San Francisco    a trash can that's been left there for    months creates a nice    degree angle against these other relationships  and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture. So  there's this sort of silent hand of design at work that I see in places that I go. Havana is a wonderful area. It's quite free of commercial clutter  you don't see our logos and brands and names  and therefore you're alert to things physically. And this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone  and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that. And Cuba needs to be far more resourceful  because of the blockades and things  but a really wonderful playground. I've often wondered why Italy is really a leader in modern design. In our area  in furnishings  they're sort of way at the top. The Dutch are good also  but the Italians are good. And I came across this little street in Venice  where the communist headquarters were sharing a wall with this Catholic shrine. And I realized that  you know  Italy is a place where they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem  or they can choose to ignore them  but these    you don't have warring factions  and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which has made Italy so innovative and so tolerant. The past and the present work quite well together in Italy also  and I think that it's recognizable there  and has an important effect on culture  because their public spaces are protected  their sidewalks are protected  and you're actually able to confront these things physically  and I think this helps people get over their fear of modernism and other such things. A change might be a typical street corner in San Francisco. And I use this    this is  sort of  what I consider to be urban spam. I notice this stuff because I walk a lot  but here  private industry is really kind of making a mess of the public sector. And as I look at it  I sort of say  you know  the publications that report on problems in the urban area also contribute to it  and it's just my call to say to all of us  public policy won't change this at all  private industry has to work to take things like this seriously. The extreme might be in Italy where  again  there's kind of some type of control over what's happening in the environment is very evident  even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals. I walk to work every day or ride my scooter  and I come down and park in this little spot. And I came down one day  and all the bikes were red. Now  this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop  and can do stuff  but this was an actual moment when I got off my bike  and I looked and I thought  it's as if all of my biker brethren had kind of gotten together and conspired to make a little statement. And it reminded me that    to keep in the present  to look out for these kinds of things. It gave me possibilities for wonder    if maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco  and we could all agree  and create some installations. But it also reminded me of the power of pattern and repetition to make an effect in our mind. And I don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of disparate elements. I was at the art show in Miami in December  and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art  and amazed at the prices of art and how expensive it is  but having a great time looking at it. And I came outside  and the valets for this car service had created  you know  quite a nice little collage of these car keys  and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that I had seen in Tokyo. And I thought that if pattern can unite these disparate elements  it can do just about anything. I don't have very many shots of people  because they kind of  get in the way of studying pure form. I was in a small restaurant in Spain  having lunch    one of those nice days where you had the place kind of to yourself  and you have a glass of wine  and enjoying the local area and the culture and the food and the quiet  and feeling very lucky  and a bus load of tourists arrived  emptied out  filled up the restaurant. In a very short period of time  completely changed the atmosphere and character with loud voices and large bodies and such  and we had to get up and leave  it was just that uncomfortable. And at that moment  the sun came out  and through this perforated screen  a pattern was cast over these bodies and they kind of faded into the rear  and we left the restaurant kind of feeling O.K. about stuff. And I do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of the most evil forces of society  such as bad form in restaurants  but quite seriously  it was a statement to me that one thing that you do  sort of  see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced    kind of  large masses of things  and when you    in monoculture  and I think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that's important to us. The last shots that I have deal with    coming back to this theme of sidewalks  and I wanted to say something here about    I'm  kind of  optimistic  you know. Post Second World War  the influence of the automobile has really been devastating in a lot of our cities. A lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots in a sort of indiscriminate use. A lot of the planning departments became subordinated to the transportation department. It's as easy to rag on cars as it is on Wal Mart  I'm not going to do that. But they're real examples in urbanization and the change that's occurred in the last number of years  and the heightened sensitivity to the importance of our urban environments as cultural centers. I think that they are  that the statements that we make in this public sector are our contributions to a larger whole. Cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with other people. We go there for stimulation in art and all those other things. But I think people have recognized the sanctity of our urban areas. A place like Chicago has really reached kind of a level of international stature. The U.S. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened urban planning and renewal  and I want to single out a place like Chicago  where I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through the political processes and all that to improve an area. You would expect a city like this to have upgraded flower boxes on Michigan Avenue where wealthy people shop  but if you actually go along the street you find the flower boxes change from street to street  there's actual diversity in the plants. And the idea that a city group can maintain different types of foliage is really quite exceptional. There are common elements of this that you'll see throughout Chicago  and then there are your big D design statements  the Pritzker Pavilion done by Frank Gehry. My measure of this as being an important bit of design is not so much the way that it looks  but the fact that it performs a very important social function. There are a lot of free concerts  for example  that go on in this area  it has a phenomenal acoustic system. But the commitment that the city has made to the public area is significant  and almost an international model. I work on the mayor's council in San Francisco  on the International Design Council for Mayors  and Chicago is looked at as the pinnacle  and I really would like to salute Mayor Daley and the folks there. I thought that I should include at least one shot of technology for you guys. This is also in Millennium Park in Chicago  where the Spanish artist designer Plensa has created  kind of  a digital readout in this park that reflects back the characters and personalities of the people in this area. And it's a welcoming area  I think  inclusive of diversity  reflective of diversity  and I think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the U.S. can really take a leadership role  and Chicago is one example. Thank you very much. Of the five senses  vision is the one that I appreciate the most  and it's the one that I can least take for granted. I think this is partially due to my father  who was blind. It was a fact that he didn't make much of a fuss about  usually. One time in Nova Scotia  when we went to see a total eclipse of the sun    yeah  same one as in the Carly Simon song  which may or may not refer to James Taylor  Warren Beatty or Mick Jagger  we're not really sure. They handed out these dark plastic viewers that allowed us to look directly at the sun without damaging our eyes. But Dad got really scared  he didn't want us doing that. He wanted us instead to use these cheap cardboard viewers so that there was no chance at all that our eyes would be damaged. I thought this was a little strange at the time. What I didn't know at the time was that my father had actually been born with perfect eyesight. When he and his sister Martha were just very little  their mom took them out to see a total eclipse    or actually  a solar eclipse    and not long after that  both of them started losing their eyesight. Decades later  it turned out that the source of their blindness was most likely some sort of bacterial infection. As near as we can tell  it had nothing whatsoever to do with that solar eclipse  but by then my grandmother had already gone to her grave thinking it was her fault. So  Dad graduated Harvard in       married my mom  and bought a house in Lexington  Massachusetts  where the first shots were fired against the British in       although we didn't actually hit any of them until Concord. He got a job working for Raytheon  designing guidance systems  which was part of the Route     high tech axis in those days    so the equivalent of Silicone Valley in the '  s. Dad wasn't a real militaristic kind of guy  he just really felt bad that he wasn't able to fight in World War II on account of his handicap  although they did let him get through the several hour long army physical exam before they got to the very last test  which was for vision. So  Dad started racking up all of these patents and gaining a reputation as a blind genius  rocket scientist  inventor. But to us he was just Dad  and our home life was pretty normal. As a kid  I watched a lot of television and had lots of nerdy hobbies like mineralogy and microbiology and the space program and a little bit of politics. I played a lot of chess. But at the age of     a friend of mine got me interested in comic books  and I decided that was what I wanted to do for a living. So  here's my dad  he's a scientist  he's an engineer and he's a military contractor. So  he has four kids  right  One grows up to become a computer scientist  one grows up to join the Navy  one grows up to become an engineer  and then there's me  the comic book artist. Which  incidentally  makes me the opposite of Dean Kamen  because I'm a comic book artist  son of an inventor  and he's an inventor  son of a comic book artist. Right  it's true. The funny thing is  Dad had a lot of faith in me. He had faith in my abilities as a cartoonist  even though he had no direct evidence that I was any good whatsoever  everything he saw was just a blur. Now  this gives a real meaning to the term  blind faith   which doesn't have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people. Now  faith in things which cannot be seen  which cannot be proved  is not the sort of faith that I've ever really related to all that much. I tend to like science  where what we see and can ascertain are the foundation of what we know. But there's a middle ground  too. A middle ground tread by people like poor old Charles Babbage  and his steam driven computers that were never built. Nobody really understood what it was that he had in mind  except for Ada Lovelace  and he went to his grave trying to pursue that dream. Vannevar Bush with his Memex    this idea of all of human knowledge at your fingertips    he had this vision. And I think a lot of people in his day probably thought he was a bit of a kook. And  yeah  we can look back in retrospect and say  yeah  ha ha  you know    it's all microfilm. But that's    that's not the point. He understood the shape of the future. So did J.C.R. Licklider and his notions for computer human interaction. Same thing  he understood the shape of the future  even though it was something that would only be implemented by people much later. Or Paul Baran  and his vision for packet switching. Hardly anybody listened to him in his day. Or even the people who actually pulled it off  the people at Bolt  Beranek and Newman in Boston  who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network  and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson's    on Route     in Lexington  Massachusetts  just two miles from where I was studying the Queen's Gambit Deferred and listening to Gladys Knight   the Pips singing  Midnight Train to Georgia   while       in my dad's big easy chair  you know  So  three types of vision  right  Vision based on what one cannot see  the vision of that unseen and unknowable. The vision of that which has already been proven or can be ascertained. And this third kind of vision  of something which can be  which may be  based on knowledge  but is as yet unproven. Now  we've seen a lot of examples of people who are pursuing that sort of vision in science  but I think it's also true in the arts  it's true in politics  it's even true in personal endeavors. What it comes down to  really  is four basic principles  learn from everyone  follow no one  watch for patterns  and work like hell. I think these are the four principles that go into this. And it's that third one  especially  where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves. What's interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world  is  I think  only one of four different ways that manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor. In comics  I know that it results in sort of a formalist attitude towards trying to understand how it works. Then there's another  more classical  attitude which embraces beauty and craft. Another one which believes in the pure transparency of content. And then another which emphasizes the authenticity of human experience    and honesty  and rawness. These are four very different ways of looking at the world. I even gave them names. The classicist  the animist  and formalist and iconoclast. Interestingly  it seemed to correspond more or less to Jung's four subdivisions of human thought. And they reflect a dichotomy of art and delight on left and the right  tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom. And if you go on the diagonal  you get content and form    and then beauty and truth. And it probably applies just as much to music and to movies and to fine art  which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all  or for that matter  nothing to do with our conference theme of  Inspired by Nature     except to the extent of the fable of the frog who gives the ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river because the scorpion promises not to sting him  but then the scorpion does sting him anyway and they both die  but not before the frog asks him why and the scorpion says   Because it's my nature     in that sense  yes. So    so this was my nature. The thing was  I saw that the route that I took to discovering this focus in my work and who I was  I saw it as just this road to discovery. Actually  it was just me embracing my nature  which means that I didn't actually fall that far from the tree after all. So what does a  scientific mind  do in the arts  Well  I started making comics  but I also started trying to understand them  almost immediately. And one of the most important things about comics  I discovered  was that comics are a visual medium  but they try to embrace all of the senses within it. So  the different elements of comics  like pictures and words  and the different symbols and everything in between that comics presents are all funneled through the single conduit of vision. So you have things like resemblance  where something which resembles the physical world can be abstracted in a couple of different directions  abstracted from resemblance  but still retaining the complete meaning  or abstracted away from both resemblance and meaning towards the picture plan. Put all these three together  and you have a nice little map of the entire boundary of visual iconography which comics can embrace. And if you move to the right you also get language  because that's abstracting even further from resemblance  but still maintaining meaning. Vision is called upon to represent sound and to understand the common properties of those two and their common heritage  as well. Also  to try to represent the texture of sound to capture its essential character through visuals. And there's also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics. Comics is a kind of call and response in which the artist gives you something to see within the panels  and then gives you something to imagine between the panels. Also  another sense which comics' vision represents  and that's time. Sequence is a very important aspect of comics. Comics presents a kind of temporal map. And this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics  but I was wondering if perhaps it also energizes other sorts of forms  and I found some in history. And you can see this same principle operating in these ancient versions of the same idea. What's happening is  the art form is colliding with the given technology  whether it's paint on stone  like the Tomb of the Scribe in ancient Egypt  or a bas relief sculpture rising up a stone column  or a     foot long embroidery  or painted deerskin and tree bark running across    accordion folded pages. What's interesting is  once you hit print    and this is from       by the way    all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves  rectilinear panel arrangements  simple line drawings without tone and a left to right reading sequence. And within     years  you already start to see word balloons and captions  and it's really just a hop  skip and a jump from here to here. So I wrote a book about this in '    but as I was finishing the book  I had to do a little bit of typesetting  and I was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it  so I bought a computer. And it was just a little thing    it wasn't good for much except text entry    but my father had told me about Moore's Law  about Moore's Law back in the '  s  and I knew what was coming. And so  I kept my eyes peeled to see if the sort of changes that happened when we went from pre print comics to print comics would happen when we went beyond  to post print comics. So  one of the first things that were proposed was that we could mix the visuals of comics with the sound  motion and interactivity of the CD ROMs that were being made in those days. This was even before the Web. And one of the first things they did was  they tried to take the comics page as is and transplant it to monitors  which was a classic McLuhanesque mistake of appropriating the shape of the previous technology as the content of the new technology. And so  what they would do is  they'd have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages  and they would introduce all this sound and motion. The problem was  that if you go with this idea    this basic idea that space equals time in comics    what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion  which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time  then they break with that continuity of presentation. Interactivity was another thing. There were hypertext comics. But the thing about hypertext is that everything in hypertext is either here  not here or connected to here  it's profoundly non spatial. The distance from Abraham Lincoln to a Lincoln penny  the Penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan to  Plan    to nine lives  it's all the same. And    but in comics  in comics  every aspect of the work  every element of the work has a spatial relationship to every other element at all times. So the question was  was there any way to preserve that spatial relationship while still taking advantage of all of the things that digital had to offer us  And I found my personal answer for this in those ancient comics that I was showing you. Each of them has a single unbroken reading line  whether it's going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column or just straight left to right  or even going in a backwards zigzag across those    accordion folded pages. The same thing is happening  and that is that the basic idea that as you move through space you move through time is being carried out without any compromise  but there were compromises when print hit. Adjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments  so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again and again and again. And I thought  O.K.  well  if that's true  is there any way  when we go beyond today's print  to somehow bring that back  Now  the monitor is just as limited as the page  technically  right  It's a different shape  but other than that it's the same basic limitation. But that's only if you look at the monitor as a page  but not if you look at the monitor as a window. And that's what I proposed  that perhaps we could create these comics on an infinite canvas  along the X axis and the Y axis and staircases. We could do circular narratives that were literally circular. We could do a turn in a story that was literally a turn. Parallel narratives could be literally parallel. X  Y and also Z. So I had all these notions. This was back in the late '  s  and other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy  but a lot of people then went on and actually did it. I'm going to show you a couple now. This was an early collage comic by a fellow named Jason Lex. And notice what's going on here. What I'm searching for is a durable mutation    that's what all of us are searching for. As media head into this new era  we are looking for mutations that are durable  that have some sort of staying power. Now  we're taking this basic idea of presenting comics in a visual medium  and then we're carrying it through all the way from beginning to end. That's that entire comic you just saw is up on the screen right now. But even though we're only experiencing it one piece at a time  that's just where the technology is right now. As the technology evolves  as you get full immersive displays and whatnot  this sort of thing will only grow. It will adapt. It will adapt to its environment  it's a durable mutation. Here's another one I'll show you. This is by Drew Weing  this is called   Pup Contemplates the Heat Death of the Universe.  See what's going on here as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas is you're creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about. We'll go by this a little quickly    you get the idea. I just want to get to the last panel. There we go. Just one more. Talk about your infinite canvas. It's by a guy named Daniel Merlin Goodbrey in Britain. Why is this important  I think this is important because media  all media  provide us a window back into our world. Now  it could be that motion pictures    and eventually  virtual reality  or something equivalent to it    some sort of immersive display  is going to provide us with our most efficient escape from the world that we're in. That's why most people turn to storytelling  is to escape. But media provides us with a window back into the world that we live in. And when media evolve so that the identity of the media becomes increasingly unique. Because what you're looking at is  you're looking at comics cubed  you're looking at comics that are more comics like than they've ever been before. When that happens  you provide people with multiple ways of re entering the world through different windows  and when you do that  it allows them to triangulate the world that they live in and see its shape. And that's why I think this is important. One of many reasons  but I've got to go now. Thank you for having me. This is a wheat bread  a whole wheat bread  and it's made with a new technique that I've been playing around with  and developing and writing about which  for lack of a better name  we call the epoxy method. And I call it an epoxy method because    it's not very appetizing. I understand that    but    but if you think about epoxy  what's epoxy  It's two resins that are  sort of  in and of themselves    neither of which can make glue  but when you put the two together  something happens. A bond takes place  and you get this very strong  powerful adhesive. Well  in this technique  what I've tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread baking world  the artisan bread baking community  has been trying to accumulate over the last    years or so    since we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in America    and put it together to come up with a method that would help to take whole grain breads. And let's face it  everyone's trying to move towards whole grains. We finally  after    years of knowing that wholegrain was a healthier option  we're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over and attempting to actually eat them. The challenge  though  for a wholegrain baker is  you know  how do you make it taste good  Because whole grain    it's easy with white flour to make a good tasting bread. White flour is sweet. It's mainly starch  and starch  when you break it down    what is starch  It's    thank you    sugar  yes. So a baker  and a good baker  knows how to pull or draw forth the inherent sugar trapped in the starch. With whole grain bread  you have other obstacles. You've got bran  which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us  or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber  for the bran is fiber. It's got germ. Those are the good things  but those aren't the tastiest parts of the wheat. So whole grain breads historically have had sort of this onus of being health food breads  and people don't like to eat  quote  health food. They like to eat healthy and healthily  but when we think of something as a health food  we think of it as something we eat out of obligation  not out of passion and love for the flavor. And ultimately  the challenge of the baker  the challenge of every culinary student  of every chef  is to deliver flavor. Flavor is king. Flavor rules. I call it the flavor rule. Flavor rules. And    and you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once  but they won't eat it again if they don't like it  right  So  this is the challenge for this bread. We're going to try this at lunch  and I'll explain a bit more about it  but it's made not only with two types of pre doughs    this attempt  again  at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before that is not leavened. It's just dough that is wet. It's hydrated dough we call  the soaker     that helps to start enzyme activity. And enzymes are the secret  kind of  ingredient in dough that brings out flavor. It starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch. That's what enzymes are doing. And so  if we can release some of those  they become accessible to us in our palate. They become accessible to the yeast as food. They become accessible to the oven for caramelization to give us a beautiful crust. The other pre dough that we make is fermented    our pre ferment. And it's made    it can be a sourdough starter  or what we call a  biga  or any other kind of pre fermented dough with a little yeast in it  and that starts to develop flavor also. And on day two  we put those two pieces together. That's the epoxy. And we're hoping that  sort of  the enzyme piece of dough becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough  and when we put them together and add the final ingredients  we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain. That's the challenge. Okay  so  now  what we    in the journey of wheat  let's go back and look at these    stages. I'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them. Okay  we're going to start with the first stage. And this is what every student has to begin with. Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is  mise en place   which is just a French way of saying   get organized.  Everything in its place. First stage. So in baking we call it scaling    weighing out the ingredients. Stage two is mixing. We take the ingredients and we mix them. We have to develop the gluten. There's no gluten in flour. There's only the potential for gluten. Here's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy because we've got glutenin and gliadin  neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread. But when they get hydrated and they bond to each other  they create a stronger molecule  a stronger protein we call gluten. And so we  in the mixing process  have to develop the gluten  we have to activate the leaven or the yeast  and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly. Then we get into fermentation  the third stage  which is really where the flavor develops. The yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars  creating carbon dioxide and alcohol    essentially it's burping and sweating  which is what bread is. It's yeast burps and sweat. And somehow  this is transformed    the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed    and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food  and we're going to explore that in a minute. But then  quickly through the next few stages. We  after it's fermented and it's developed  started to develop flavor and character  we divide it into smaller units. And then we take those units and we shape them. We give them a little pre shape  usually a round or a little torpedo shape  sometimes. That's called  rounding.  And there's a short rest period. It can be for a few seconds. It can be for    or    minutes. We call that resting or benching. Then we go into final shaping   panning     which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan. This takes a second  but it's a distinctive stage. It can be in a basket. It can be in a loaf pan  but we pan it. And then  stage nine. The fermentation which started at stage three is continuing through all these other stages. Again  developing more flavor. The final fermentation takes place in stage nine. We call it  proofing.  Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive. And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape  and it goes into the oven    stage   . Three transformations take place in the oven. The sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust. They give us that beautiful brown crust. Only the crust can caramelize. It's the only place that gets hot enough. Inside  the proteins    this gluten    coagulates. When it gets to about     degrees  the proteins all line up  and they create structure  the gluten structure    what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread. And the starches  when they reach about     degrees  gelatinize. And gelatinization is yet another oven transformation. Coagulation  caramelization and gelatinization    when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that's around them  they    they kind of swell  and then they burst. And they burst  and they spill their guts into the bread. So basically now we're eating yeast sweats    sweat  burps and starch guts. Again  transformed in stage    in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage    as bread. And stage     we call it cooling    because we never really eat the bread right away. There's a little carry over baking. The proteins have to set up  strengthen and firm up. And then we have stage     which the textbooks call  packaging   but my students call  eating.  And so  we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat  and in a few minutes we will try this  and see if we have succeeded in fulfilling this baker's mission of pulling out flavor. But I want to go back now and revisit these steps  and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation  because I really believe that all things can be understood    and this is not my own idea. This goes back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients    that all things can be understood on four levels  the literal  the metaphoric or poetic level  the political or ethical level. And ultimately  the mystical or sometimes called the  anagogical  level. It's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal. In fact  Dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels unless you first understand the literal level  so that's why we're talking literally about bread. But let's kind of look at these stages again from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level    all in my quest for answering the question   What is it about bread that's so special   And fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor. Because what happens is  bread begins as wheat or any other grain. But what's wheat  Wheat is a grass that grows in the field. And  like all grasses  at a certain point it puts out seeds. And we harvest those seeds  and those are the wheat kernels. Now  in order to harvest it    I mean  what's harvesting  It's just a euphemism for killing  right  I mean  that's what's harvest    we say we harvest the pig  you know  Yes  we slaughter  you know. Yes  that's life. We harvest the wheat  and in harvesting it  we kill it. Now  wheat is alive  and as we harvest it  it gives up its seeds. Now  at least with seeds we have the potential for future life. We can plant those in the ground. And we save some of those for the next generation. But most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour. And at that point  the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity. It's not only been killed  but it's been denied any potential for creating future life. So we turn it into flour. So as I said  I think bread is a transformational food. The first transformation    and  by the way  the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else. O.K.  Radical  not subtle. Not like hot water made cold  or cold water turned hot  but water boiled off and becoming steam. That's a transformation  two different things. Well  in this case  the first transformation is alive to dead. I'd call that radical. So  we've got now this flour. And what do we do  We add some water. In stage one  we weigh it. In stage two  we add water and salt to it  mix it together  and we create something that we call  clay.  It's like clay. And we infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call  leaven.  In this case  it's yeast  but yeast is leaven. What does leaven mean  Leaven comes from the root word that means enliven    to vivify  to bring to life. By the way  what's the Hebrew word for clay  Adam. You see  the baker  in this moment  has become  in a sense  sort of  the God of his dough  you know  and his dough  well  while it's not an intelligent life form  is now alive. And we know it's alive because in stage three  it grows. Growth is the proof of life. And while it's growing  all these literal transformations are taking place. Enzymes are breaking forth sugars. Yeast is eating sugar and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol. Bacteria is in there  eating the same sugars  turning them into acids. In other words  personality and character's being developed in this dough under the watchful gaze of the baker. And the baker's choices all along the way determine the outcome of the product. A subtle change in temperature    a subtle change in time    it's all about a balancing act between time  temperature and ingredients. That's the art of baking. So all these things are determined by the baker  and the bread goes through some stages  and characters develop. And then we divide it  and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units  and each of those units are given shape by the baker. And as they're shaped  they're raised again  all along proving that they're alive  and developing character. And at stage     we take it to the oven. It's still dough. Nobody eats bread dough    a few people do  I think  but not too many. I've met some dough eaters  but    it's not the staff of life  right  Bread is the staff of life. But dough is what we're working with  and we take that dough to the oven  and it goes into the oven. As soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of     degrees  it passes what we call the  thermal death point.  Students love that TDP. They think it's the name of a video game. But it's the thermal death point    all life ceases there. The yeast  whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough  to enliven it  to vivify it  in order to complete its mission  which is also to turn this dough into bread  has to give up its life. So you see the symbolism at work  It's starting to come forth a little bit  you know. It's starting to make sense to me    what goes in is dough  what comes out is bread    or it goes in alive  comes out dead. Third transformation. First transformation  alive to dead. Second transformation  dead brought back to life. Third transformation  alive to dead    but dough to bread. Or another analogy would be  a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly. And it's what comes out of the oven that is what we call the staff of life. This is the product that everyone in the world eats  that is so difficult to give up. It's so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life. It's used as a symbol for transformation. And so  as we get to stage    and we partake of that  again completing the life cycle  you know  we have a chance to essentially ingest that    it nurtures us  and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this. So this is what I've learned from bread. This is what bread has taught me in my journey. And what we're going to attempt to do with this bread here  again  is to use  in addition to everything we talked about  this bread we're going to call  spent grain bread  because  as you know  bread making is very similar to beer making. Beer is basically liquid bread  or bread is solid beer. And    they    they're invented around the same time. I think beer came first. And the Egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep in the hot  Egyptian sun  and it turned into bread. But we've got this bread  and what I did here is to try to  again  evoke even more flavor from this grain  was we've added into it the spent grain from beer making. And if you make this bread  you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer. I like dark spent grain. Today we're using a light spent grain that's actually from  like  some kind of a lager of some sort    a light lager or an ale    that is wheat and barley that's been toasted. In other words  the beer maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains by using sprouting and malting and roasting. We're going to take some of that  and put it into the bread. So now we not only have a high fiber bread  but now fiber on top of fiber. And so this is  again  hopefully not only a healthy bread  but a bread that you will enjoy. So  if I  kind of  break this bread  maybe we can share this now a little bit here. We'll start a little piece here  and I'm going to take a little piece here    I think I'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch. I'll leave you with what I call the baker's blessing. May your crust be crisp  and your bread always rise. Thank you. I'm going to talk about a very fundamental change that is going on in the very fabric of the modern economy. And to talk about that  I'm going to go back to the beginning  because in the beginning were commodities. Commodities are things that you grow in the ground  raise on the ground or pull out of the ground  basically  animal  mineral  vegetable. And then you extract them out of the ground  and sell them on the open marketplace. Commodities were the basis of the agrarian economy that lasted for millennia. But then along came the industrial revolution  and then goods became the predominant economic offering  where we used commodities as a raw material to be able to make or manufacture goods. So  we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy. Well  what then happened over the last    or    years  is that goods have become commoditized. Commoditized  where they're treated like a commodity  where people don't care who makes them. They just care about three things and three things only  price  price and price. Now  there's an antidote to commoditization  and that is customization. My first book was called  Mass Customization     it came up a couple of times yesterday    and how I discovered this progression of economic value was realizing that customizing a good automatically turned it into a service  because it was done just for a particular person  because it wasn't inventoried  it was delivered on demand to that individual person. So  we moved from an industrial economy to a service based economy. But over the past    or    years  what's happened is that services are being commoditized as well. Long distance telephone service sold on price  price  price  fast food restaurants with all their value pricing  and even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods  but services as well. What that means is that it's time to move to a new level of economic value. Time to go beyond the goods and the services  and use  in that same heuristic  what happens when you customize a service  What happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person    that's exactly what they need at this moment in time  Then you can't help but make them go  wow   you can't help but turn it into a memorable event    you can't help but turn it into an experience. So we're shifting to an experience economy  where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering. Now most places that I talk to  when I talk about experience  I talk about Disney    the world's premier experience stager. I talk about theme restaurants  and experiential retail  and boutique hotels  and Las Vegas    the experience capital of the world. But here  when you think about experiences  think about Thomas Dolby and his group  playing music. Think about meaningful places. Think about drinking wine  about a journey to the Clock of the Long Now. Those are all experiences. Think about TED itself. The experience capital in the world of conferences. All of these are experiences. Now  over the last several years I spent a lot of time in Europe  and particularly in the Netherlands  and whenever I talk about the experience economy there  I'm always greeted at the end with one particular question  almost invariably. And the question isn't really so much a question as an accusation. And the Dutch  when they usually put it  it always starts with the same two words. You know the words I mean  You Americans. They say  you Americans. You like your fantasy environments  your fake  your Disneyland experiences. They say  we Dutch  we like real  natural  authentic experiences. So much has that happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response  which is  I point out that first of all  you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience. Why  Because the experience happens inside of us. It's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us. So  as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings  then every experience we have is authentic. Now  there may be more or less natural or artificial stimuli for the experience  but even that is a matter of degree  not kind. And there's no such thing as a     percent natural experience. Even if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods  there is a company that manufactured the car that delivered you to the edge of the woods  there's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have to protect yourself from the ground of the woods. There's a company that provides a cell phone service you have in case you get lost in the woods. Right  All of those are man made  artificiality brought into the woods by you  and by the very nature of being there. And then I always finish off by talking about    the thing that amazes me the most about this question  particularly coming from the Dutch  is that the Netherlands is every bit as manufactured as Disneyland. And the Dutch  they always go ... and they realize  I'm right  There isn't a square meter of ground in the entire country that hasn't been reclaimed from the sea  or otherwise moved  modified and manicured to look as if it had always been there. It's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows. But nonetheless  not just the Dutch  but everyone has this desire for the authentic. And authenticity is therefore becoming the new consumer sensibility    the buying criteria by which consumers are choosing who are they going to buy from  and what they're going to buy. Becoming the basis of the economy. In fact  you can look at how each of these economies developed  that each one has their own business imperative  matched with a consumer sensibility. We're the agrarian economy  and we're supplying commodities. It's about supply and availability. Getting the commodities to market. With the industrial economy  it is about controlling costs    getting the costs down as low as possible so we can offer them to the masses. With the service economy  it is about improving quality. That has    the whole quality movement has risen with the service economy over the past    or    years. And now  with the experience economy  it's about rendering authenticity. Rendering authenticity    and the keyword is  rendering.  Right  Rendering  because you have to get your consumers    as business people    to percieve your offerings as authentic. Because there is a basic paradox  no one can have an inauthentic experience  but no business can supply one. Because all businesses are man made objects  all business is involved with money  all business is a matter of using machinery  and all those things make something inauthentic. So  how do you render authenticity  is the question. Are you rendering authenticity  When you think about that  let me go back to what Lionel Trilling  in his seminal book on authenticity   Sincerity and Authenticity     came out in         points to as the seminal point at which authenticity entered the lexicon  if you will. And that is  to no surprise  in Shakespeare  and in his play  Hamlet. And there is one part in this play  Hamlet  where the most fake of all the characters in Hamlet  Polonius  says something profoundly real. At the end of a laundry list of advice he's giving to his son  Laertes  he says this  And this above all  to thine own self be true. And it doth follow  as night the day  that thou canst not then be false to any man. And those three verses are the core of authenticity. There are two dimensions to authenticity  one  being true to yourself  which is very self directed. Two  is other directed  being what you say you are to others. And I don't know about you  but whenever I encounter two dimensions  I immediately go  ahh  two by two  All right  Anybody else like that  no  Well  if you think about that  you do  in fact  get a two by two. Where  on one dimension it's a matter of being true to yourself. As businesses  are the economic offerings you are providing    are they true to themselves  And the other dimension is  are they what they say they are to others  If not  you have   is not true to itself   and  is not what it says it is   yielding a two by two matrix. And of course  if you are both true to yourself  and are what you say you are  then you're real real  The opposite  of course  is    fake fake. All right  now  there is value for fake. There will always be companies around to supply the fake  because there will always be desire for the fake. Fact is  there's a general rule  if you don't like it  it's fake  if you do like it  it's faux. Now  the other two sides of the coin are  being a real fake    is what it says it is  but is not true to itself  or being a fake real  is true to itself  but not what it says it is. You can think about those two    you know  both of these better than being fake fake    not quite as good as being real real. You can contrast them by thinking about Universal City Walk versus Disney World  or Disneyland. Universal City Walk is a real fake    in fact  we got this very term from Ada Louise Huxtable's book   The Unreal America.  A wonderful book  where she talks about Universal City Walk as    you know  she decries the fake  but she says  at least that's a real fake  right  because you can see behind the facade  right  It is what it says it is  It's Universal Studio  it's in the city of Los Angeles  you're going to walk a lot. Right  You don't tend to walk a lot in Los Angeles  well  here's a place where you are going to walk a lot  outside in this city. But is it really true to itself  Right  Is it really in the city  Is it    you can see behind all of it  and see what is going on in the facades of it. So she calls it a real fake. Disney World  on the other hand  is a fake real  or a fake reality. Right  It's not what it says it is. It's not really the magic kingdom. But it is    oh  I'm sorry  I didn't mean to       sorry. We won't talk about Santa Claus then. But Disney World is wonderfully true to itself. Right  Just wonderfully true to itself. When you are there you are just immersed in this wonderful environment. So  it's a fake real. Now the easiest way to fall down in this  and not be real real  right  the easiest way not to be true to yourself is not to understand your heritage  and thereby repudiate that heritage. Right  the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business. Knowing where your heritage is  what you have done in the past. And what you have done in the past limits what you can do  what you can get away with  essentially  in the future. So  you have to understand that past. Think about Disney again. Disney     or    years ago  right  the Disney    the company that is probably best known for family values out there  Disney bought the ABC network. The ABC network  affectionately known in the trade as the T A network  right    that's not too much jargon  is it  Right  the T A network. Then it bought Miramax  known for its NC    fare  and all of a sudden  families everywhere couldn't really trust what they were getting from Disney. It was no longer true to its heritage  no longer true to Walt Disney. That's one of the reasons why they're having such trouble today  and why Roy Disney is out to get Michael Eisner. Because it is no longer true to itself. So  understand what    your past limits what you can do in the future. When it comes to being what you say you are  the easiest mistake that companies make is that they advertise things that they are not. That's when you're perceived as fake  as a phony company    advertizing things that you're not. Think about any hotel  any airline  any hospital. Right  if you could check into the ads  you'd have a great experience. But unfortunately  you have to experience the actual hotel  airline and hospital  and then you have that disconnect. Then you have that perception that you are phony. So  the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are  is to provide places for people to experience who you are. For people to experience who you are. Right  it's not advertising does it. That's why you have companies like Starbucks  right  that doesn't advertise at all. They said  you want to know who we are  you have to come experience us. And think about the economic value they have provided by that experience. Right  Coffee  at its core  is what  Right  It's beans  right  It's coffee beans. You know how much coffee is worth  when treated as a commodity as a bean  Two or three cents per cup    that's what coffee is worth. But grind it  roast it  package it  put it on a grocery store shelf  and now it'll cost five         cents  when you treat it as a good. Take that same good  and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer  in a corner diner  in a bodega  a kiosk somewhere  you get    cents  maybe a buck per cup of coffee. But surround the brewing of that coffee with the ambiance of a Starbucks  with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there  and now  because of that authentic experience  you can charge two  three  four  five dollars for a cup of coffee. So  authenticity is becoming the new consumer sensibility. Let me summarize it  for the business people in the audience  with three rules  three basic rules. One  don't say you're authentic unless you really are authentic. Two  it's easier to be authentic if you don't say you're authentic. And three  if you say you're authentic  you better be authentic. And then for the consumers  for everyone else in the audience  let me simply summarize it by saying  increasingly  what we    what will make us happy  is spending our time and our money satisfying the desire for authenticity. Thank you. My work is play. And I play when I design. I even looked it up in the dictionary  to make sure that I actually do that  and the definition of play  number one  was engaging in a childlike activity or endeavor  and number two was gambling. And I realize I do both when I'm designing. I'm both a kid and I'm gambling all the time. And I think that if you're not  there's probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you're in  if you're a designer. But the serious part is what threw me  and I couldn't quite get a handle on it until I remembered an essay. And it's an essay I read    years ago. It was written by Russell Baker  who used to write an  Observer  column in the New York Times. He's a wonderful humorist. And I'm going to read you this essay  or an excerpt from it because it really hit home for me. Here is a letter of friendly advice. Be serious  it says. What it means  of course  is  be solemn. Being solemn is easy. Being serious is hard. Children almost always begin by being serious  which is what makes them so entertaining when compared with adults as a class. Adults  on the whole  are solemn. In politics  the rare candidate who is serious  like Adlai Stevenson  is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn  like Eisenhower. That's because it is hard for most people to recognize seriousness  which is rare  but more comfortable to endorse solemnity  which is commonplace. Jogging  which is commonplace  and widely accepted as good for you  is solemn. Poker is serious. Washington  D.C. is solemn. New York is serious. Going to educational conferences to tell you anything about the future is solemn. Taking a long walk by yourself  during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing Tiffany's  is serious. Now  when I apply Russell Baker's definition of solemnity or seriousness to design  it doesn't necessarily make any particular point about quality. Solemn design is often important and very effective design. Solemn design is also socially correct  and is accepted by appropriate audiences. It's what right thinking designers and all the clients are striving for. Serious design  serious play  is something else. For one thing  it often happens spontaneously  intuitively  accidentally or incidentally. It can be achieved out of innocence  or arrogance  or out of selfishness  sometimes out of carelessness. But mostly  it's achieved through all those kind of crazy parts of human behavior that don't really make any sense. Serious design is imperfect. It's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being the first of its kind. Serious design is also    often    quite unsuccessful from the solemn point of view. That's because the art of serious play is about invention  change  rebellion    not perfection. Perfection happens during solemn play. Now  I always saw design careers like surreal staircases. If you look at the staircase  you'll see that in your   s the risers are very high and the steps are very short  and you make huge discoveries. You sort of leap up very quickly in your youth. That's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn  and so that anything you do is a learning experience and you're just jumping right up there. As you get older  the risers get shallower and the steps get wider  and you start moving along at a slower pace because you're making fewer discoveries. And as you get older and more decrepit  you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing  long staircase  leading you into oblivion. I find it's actually getting really hard to be serious. I'm hired to be solemn  but I find more and more that I'm solemn when I don't have to be. And in my    years of working experience  I think I was really serious four times. And I'm going to show them to you now  because they came out of very specific conditions. It's great to be a kid. Now  when I was in my early   s  I worked in the record business  designing record covers for CBS Records  and I had no idea what a great job I had. I thought everybody had a job like that. And what    the way I looked at design and the way I looked at the world was  what was going on around me and the things that came at the time I walked into design were the enemy. I really  really  really hated the typeface Helvetica. I thought the typeface Helvetica was the cleanest  most boring  most fascistic  really repressive typeface  and I hated everything that was designed in Helvetica. And when I was in my college days  this was the sort of design that was fashionable and popular. This is actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak  but I just hated it  because it was designed with Helvetica  and I made parodies about it. I just thought it was  you know  completely boring. So    so  my goal in life was to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica. And to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica was actually kind of hard because you had to find it. And there weren't a lot of books about the history of design in the early   s. There weren't    there wasn't a plethora of design publishing. You actually had to go to antique stores. You had to go to Europe. You had to go places and find the stuff. And what I responded to was  you know  Art Nouveau  or deco  or Victorian typography  or things that were just completely not Helvetica. And I taught myself design this way  and this was sort of my early years  and I used these things in really goofy ways on record covers and in my design. I wasn't educated. I just sort of put these things together. I mixed up Victorian designs with pop  and I mixed up Art Nouveau with something else. And I made these very lush  very elaborate record covers  not because I was being a post modernist or a historicist    because I didn't know what those things were. I just hated Helvetica. And that kind of passion drove me into very serious play  a kind of play I could never do now because I'm too well educated. And there's something wonderful about that form of youth  where you can let yourself grow and play  and be really a brat  and then accomplish things. By the end of the '  s  actually  the stuff became known. I mean  these covers appeared all over the world  and they started winning awards  and people knew them. And I was suddenly a post modernist  and I began a career as    in my own business. And first I was praised for it  then criticized for it  but the fact of the matter was  I had become solemn. I didn't do what I think was a piece of serious work again for about    years. I spent most of the '  s being quite solemn  turning out these sorts of designs that I was expected to do because that's who I was  and I was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn to hackneyed to dead  and getting rediscovered all over again. So  here was the second condition for which I think I accomplished some serious play. There's a Paul Newman movie that I love called  The Verdict.  I don't know how many of you have seen it  but it's a beaut. And in the movie  he plays a down and out lawyer who's become an ambulance chaser. And he's taken on    he's given  actually    a malpractice suit to handle that's sort of an easy deal  and in the midst of trying to connect the deal  he starts to empathize and identify with his client  and he regains his morality and purpose  and he goes on to win the case. And in the depth of despair  in the midst of the movie  when it looks like he can't pull this thing off  and he needs this case  he needs to win this case so badly. There's a shot of Paul Newman alone  in his office  saying   This is the case. There are no other cases. This is the case. There are no other cases.  And in that moment of desire and focus  he can win. And that is a wonderful position to be in to create some serious play. And I had that moment in      when I met a theater director named George Wolfe  who was going to have me design an identity for the New York Shakespeare Festival  then known  and then became the Public Theater. And I began getting immersed in this project in a way I never was before. This is what theater advertising looked like at that time. This is what was in the newspapers and in the New York Times. So  this is sort of a comment on the time. And the Public Theater actually had much better advertising than this. They had no logo and no identity  but they had these very iconic posters painted by Paul Davis. And George Wolf had taken over from another director and he wanted to change the theater  and he wanted to make it urban and loud and a place that was inclusive. So  drawing on my love of typography  I immersed myself into this project. And what was different about it was the totality of it  was that I really became the voice  the visual voice  of a place in a way I had never done before  where every aspect    the smallest ad  the ticket  whatever it was    was designed by me. There was no format. There was no in house department that these things were pushed to. I literally for three years made everything    every scrap of paper  everything online  that this theater did. And it was the only job  even though I was doing other jobs. I lived and breathed it in a way I haven't with a client since. It enabled me to really express myself and grow. And I think that you know when you're going to be given this position  and it's rare  but when you get it and you have this opportunity  it's the moment of serious play. I did these things  and I still do them. I still work for the Public Theater. I'm on their board  and I still am involved with it. The high point of the Public Theater  I think  was in       two years after I designed it  which was the  Bring in 'da Noise  Bring in 'da Funk  campaign that was all over New York. But something happened to it  and what happened to it was  it became very popular. And that is a kiss of death for something serious because it makes it solemn. And what happened was that New York City  to a degree  ate my identity because people began to copy it. Here's an ad in the New York Times somebody did for a play called  Mind Games.  Then  Chicago  came out  used similar graphics  and the Public Theater's identity was just totally eaten and taken away  which meant I had to change it. So  I changed it so that every season was different  and I continued to do these posters  but they never had the seriousness of the first identity because they were too individual  and they didn't have that heft of everything being the same thing. Now    and I think since the Public Theater  I must have done more than a dozen cultural identities for major institutions  and I don't think I ever    I ever grasped that seriousness again    I do them for very big  important institutions in New York City. The institutions are solemn  and so is the design. They're better crafted than the Public Theater was  and they spend more money on them  but I think that that moment comes and goes. The best way to accomplish serious design    which I think we all have the opportunity to do    is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job. That doesn't happen very often  but it happened to me in the year       when for some reason or another  a whole pile of different architects started to ask me to design the insides of theaters with them  where I would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings. I'd never done this kind of work before. I didn't know how to read an architectural plan  I didn't know what they were talking about  and I really couldn't handle the fact that a job    a single job    could go on for four years because I was used to immediacy in graphic design  and that kind of attention to detail was really bad for somebody like me  with ADD. So  it was a rough    it was a rough go  but I fell in love with this process of actually integrating graphics into architecture because I didn't know what I was doing. I said   Why can't the signage be on the floor   New Yorkers look at their feet. And then I found that actors and actresses actually take their cues from the floor  so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems began to make sense. They integrated with the building in really peculiar ways. They ran around corners  they went up sides of buildings  and they melded into the architecture. This is Symphony Space on   th Street and Broadway  and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and backlit with fiber optics. And the architect  Jim Polshek  essentially gave me a canvas to play typography out on. And it was serious play. This is the children's museum in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  made out of completely inexpensive materials. Extruded typography that's backlit with neon. Things I never did before  built before. I just thought they'd be kind of fun to do. Donors' walls made out of Lucite. And then  inexpensive signage. I think my favorite of these was this little job in Newark  New Jersey. It's a performing arts school. This is the building that    they had no money  and they had to recast it  and they said  if we give you         dollars  what can you do with it  And I did a little Photoshop job on it  and I said  Well  I think we can paint it. And we did. And it was play. And there's the building. Everything was painted    typography over the whole damn thing  including the air conditioning ducts. I hired guys who paint flats fixed on the sides of garages to do the painting on the building  and they loved it. They got into it    they took the job incredibly seriously. They used to climb up on the building and call me and tell me that they had to correct my typography    that my spacing was wrong  and they moved it  and they did wonderful things with it. They were pretty serious  too. It was quite wonderful. By the time I did Bloomberg's headquarters my work had begun to become accepted. People wanted it in big  expensive places. And that began to make it solemn. Bloomberg was all about numbers  and we did big numbers through the space and the numbers were projected on a spectacular LED that my partner  Lisa Strausfeld  programmed. But it became the end of the seriousness of the play  and it started to  once again  become solemn. This is a current project in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  where I got to be goofy. I was invited to design a logo for this neighborhood  called the North Side  and I thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo. I think that's rather creepy  actually. Why would a neighborhood have a logo  A neighborhood has a thing    it's got a landmark  it's got a place  it's got a restaurant. It doesn't have a logo. I mean  what would that be  So I had to actually give a presentation to a city council and neighborhood constituents  and I went to Pittsburgh and I said   You know  really what you have here are all these underpasses that separate the neighborhood from the center of town. Why don't you celebrate them  and make the underpasses landmarks   So I began doing this crazy presentation of these installations    potential installations    on these underpass bridges  and stood up in front of the city council    and was a little bit scared  I have to admit. But I was so utterly unqualified for this project  and so utterly ridiculous  and ignored the brief so desperately that I think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness  just completely because it was so goofy to begin with. And this is the bridge they're actually painting up and preparing as we speak. It will change every six months  and it will become an art installation in the North Side of Pittsburgh  and it will probably become a landmark in the area. John Hockenberry told you a bit about my travail with Citibank  that is now a    year relationship  and I still work with them. And I actually am amused by them and like them  and think that as a very  very  very  very  very big corporation they actually keep their graphics very nice. I drew the logo for Citibank on a napkin in the first meeting. That was the play part of the job. And then I spent a year going to long  tedious  boring meetings  trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the point of tears. I thought I was going to go crazy at the end of this year. We made idiotic presentations showing how the Citi logo made sense  and how it was really derived from an umbrella  and we made animations of these things  and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. And it was worth it  because they bought this thing  and it played out on such a grand scale  and it's so internationally recognizable  but for me it was actually a very  very depressing year. As a matter of fact  they actually never bought onto the logo until Fallon put it on its very good  Live Richly  campaign  and then everybody accepted it all over the world. So during this time I needed some kind of counterbalance for this crazy  crazy existence of going to these long  idiotic meetings. And I was up in my country house  and for some reason  I began painting these very big  very involved  laborious  complicated maps of the entire world  and listing every place on the planet  and putting them in  and misspelling them  and putting things in the wrong spot  and completely controlling the information  and going totally and completely nuts with it. They would take me about six months initially  but then I started getting faster at it. Here's the United States. Every single city of the United States is on here. And it hung for about eight months at the Cooper Hewitt  and people walked up to it  and they would point to a part of the map and they'd say   Oh  I've been here.  And  of course  they couldn't have been because it's in the wrong spot. But what I liked about it was  I was controlling my own idiotic information  and I was creating my own palette of information  and I was totally and completely at play. One of my favorites was this painting I did of Florida after the      election that has the election results rolling around in the water. I keep that for evidence. Somebody was up at my house and saw the paintings and recommended them to a gallery  and I had a first show about two and a half years ago  and I showed these paintings that I'm showing you now. And then a funny thing happened    they sold. And they sold quickly  and became rather popular. We started making prints from them. This is Manhattan  one from the series. This is a print from the United States which we did in red  white and blue. We began doing these big silkscreen prints  and they started selling  too. So  the gallery wanted me to have another show in two years  which meant that I really had to paint these paintings much faster than I had ever done them. And I    they started to become more political  and I picked areas that sort of were in the news or that I had some feeling about  and I began doing these things. And then this funny thing happened. I found that I was no longer at play. I was actually in this solemn landscape of fulfilling an expectation for a show  which is not where I started with these things. So  while they became successful  I know how to make them  so I'm not a neophyte  and they're no longer serious    they have become solemn. And that's a terrifying factor    when you start something and it turns that way    because it means that all that's left for you is to go back and to find out what the next thing is that you can push  that you can invent  that you can be ignorant about  that you can be arrogant about  that you can fail with  and that you can be a fool with. Because in the end  that's how you grow  and that's all that matters. So  I'm plugging along here    and I'm just going to have to blow up the staircase. Thank you very much. I had requested slides  kind of adamantly  up till the    pretty much  last few days  but was denied access to a slide projector. I actually find them a lot more emotional       and personal  and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work  unlike PowerPoint and some other programs. Now  I agree that you have to    yeah  there are certain concessions and  you know  if you use a slide projector  you're not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side  or up or down  but maybe that's an O.K. trade off  to trade that off for a focus. It's a thought. Just a thought. And there's something nice about slides getting stuck. And the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up  which we won't see tonight. So. With that  let's get the first slide up here. This  as many of you have probably guessed  is a recently emptied beer can in Portugal. This    I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time  and I thought    you know  fly all night  I looked up  and I thought  wow  how clean. You come into this major airport  and they simply have a B. I mean  how nice is that  Everything's gotten simpler in design  and here's this mega airport  and God  I just    I took a picture. I thought  God  that is the coolest thing I've ever seen at an airport. Till a couple months later  I went back to the same airport    same plane  I think    and looked up  and it said C. It was only then that I realized it was simply a gate that I was coming into. I'm a big believer in the emotion of design  and the message that's sent before somebody begins to read  before they get the rest of the information  what is the emotional response they get to the product  to the story  to the painting    whatever it is. That area of design interests me the most  and I think this for me is a real clear  very simplified version of what I'm talking about. These are a couple of garage doors painted identical  situated next to each other. So  here's the first door. You know  you get the message. You know  it's pretty clear. Take a look at the second door and see if there's any different message. O.K.  which one would you park in front of  Same color  same message  same words. The only thing that's different is the expression that the individual door owner here put into the piece    and  again  which is the psycho killer here  Yet it doesn't say that  it doesn't need to say that. I would probably park in front of the other one. I'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so. It's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive. But I was in Milan and saw this street sign  and was very happy to see that apparently this idea of minimalism has even been translated by the graffiti artist. And this graffiti artist has come along  made this sign a little bit better  and then moved on. He didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do. This is for a book by  Metropolis.  I took some photos  and this is a billboard in Florida  and either they hadn't paid their rent  or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign  and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down  so they just teared out sections of it. And I would argue that it's possibly more effective than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention  getting you to look over that way. And hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things    Stuckey's. This is from my second book. The first book is called   The End of Print   and it was done along with a film  working with William Burroughs. And  The End of Print  is now in its fifth printing. When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it  he said no  he said he didn't believe it was the end of print. And I said  well  that's fine  I just would love to have your input on this film and this book  and he finally agreed to it. And at the end of the film  he says in this great voice that I can't mimic but I'll kind of try  but not really  he says   I remember attending an exhibition called  'Photography  The End of Painting.'  And then he says   And  of course  it wasn't at all.  So  apparently when photography was perfected  there were people going around saying  that's it  you've just ruined painting. People are just going to take pictures now. And of course  that wasn't the case. So  this is from   nd Sight   a book I did on intuition. I think it's not the only ingredient in design  but possibly the most important. It's something everybody has. It's not a matter of teaching it  in fact  most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can't quantify it  it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design  but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter. So it tends to get discounted. This is a quote from Albert Einstein  who says   The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery. There comes a leap in consciousness    call it intuition or what you will    and the solution just comes to you  and you don't know from where or why.  So  it's kind of like when somebody says  Who did that song  And the more you try to think about it  the further the answer gets from you  and the minute you stop thinking about it  your intuition gives you that answer  in a sense. I like this for a couple of reasons. If you've had any design courses  they would teach you you can't read this. I think you eventually can and  more importantly  I think it's true.  Don't mistake legibility for communication.  Just because something's legible doesn't means it communicates. More importantly  it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing. So  what is the message sent before somebody actually gets into the material  And I think that's sometimes an overlooked area. This is working with Marshall McLuhan. I stayed and worked with his wife and son  Eric  and we came up with close to     quotes from Marshall that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times  predicting so much of what has happened in the advertising  television  media world. And so this book is called  Probes.  It's another word for quotes. And it's    a lot of them are never    have never been published before  and basically  I've interpreted the different quotes. So  this was the contents page originally. When I got done it was     pages  and then the publisher  Gingko Press  ended up cutting it down considerably  it's just under     pages now. But I decided I liked this contents page    I liked the way it looks    so I kept it. It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever  but it's a nice spread  I think  in there. So  a couple spreads from the book  here McLuhan says   The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature  they are Nature.   The invention of printing did away with anonymity  fostering ideas of literary fame and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property   which had never been done before printing.  When new technologies impose themselves on societies long habituated to older technologies  anxieties of all kinds result.   While people are engaged in creating a totally different world  they always form vivid images of the preceding world.  I hate this stuff. It's hard to read.  People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe  and no possible occupation except information gathering.  That was it. That's all he saw as the options. And not too far off. So  this is a project for Nine Inch Nails. And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden  and it was done right after     . And I had recently discovered a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house I had bought in LA that the real estate person hadn't pointed out. There was some bomb shelter built  apparently in the '  s Cuban missile crisis. And I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by  and he goes   It's something to do with the sewage system.  I was  O.K.  that's fine. I finally went down there  and it was this old rusted circular thing  and two beds  and very kind of creepy and weird. And also  surprisingly  it was done in kind of a cheap metal  and it had completely rusted through  and water everywhere  and spiders. And I thought  you know  what were they thinking  You'd think maybe cement  possibly  or something. But anyway  I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD  and I've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape  and it's ready. I think I'm ready. So. This is an experiment  really  for a client  Quicksilver  where we were taking what was a six shot sequence and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web. So  this is a six shot sequence. I've taken one shot  I cropped it a few different ways. And then the tiny line of copy says  If you want to see this entire sequence    how this whole ride was    go to the website. And my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site to get this entire picture. Got no way of tracking it  so I could be totally wrong. I don't have the site. It's just the piece itself. This is a group in New York called the Coalition for a Smoke free Environment    asked me to do these posters. They were wild posted around New York City. You can't really    well  you can't see it at all    but the second line is really the more kind of payoff  in a sense. It says   If the cigarette companies can lie  then so can we.  But       but I did. These were literally wild posted all over New York one night  and there were definitely some heads turning  you know  people smoking and   Huh   And it was purposely done to look fairly serious. It wasn't some  you know  weird grunge type or something  it looked like they might be real. Anyway. Poster for Atlantic Center for the Arts  a school in Florida. This amazes me. This is a product I just found out. I was in the Caribbean at Christmas  and I'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell    not that they will sell    that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin. This was either an old product with new packaging  or a brand new package  and I just thought  Yikes  How's that still happening  I do a lot of workshops all over the world  really  and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors. I felt this was one of the more successful solutions. The students actually cut them up and put them up around bars and restaurants that night  and I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom ... I did some work for Microsoft a few years back. It was a worldwide branding campaign. And it was interesting to me    my background is in sociology  I had no design training  and sometimes people say  well  that explains it    but it was a very interesting experiment because there's no product that I had to sell  it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve. They thought some people didn't like them. I found out that's very true  working on this campaign worldwide. And our goal was to try to humanize them a bit  and what I did was add type and people to the ad  which the previous campaign had not had  and nobody remembered them  and nobody referenced them. And we were trying to say that  hey  some of these guys that work there are actually OK  some of them actually have friends and family  and they're not all awful people. And the umbrella campaign was  Thank God it's Monday.  So  we tried to take this    what was perceived as a negative  their over competitiveness  their  you know  long working hours    and turn it into a positive and not run from it. You know  Thank God it's Monday    I get to go back to that little cubicle  those fake gray walls  and hear everybody else's conversations f or    hours and then go home. But anyway  this is one of the ads I was most pleased with  because they were all elaborately art directed  and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer. It says   Wonder Around.  And then it's a piece of the software. And this is how the ad ran around the world. In Germany  they made one small change without checking with me    nor did they have to  because it was done through agencies    but see if you can tell the difference. This is how the ad ran throughout the world  Germany made one slight change in the ad. Now  there's kind of two issues here. If you're going to put a kid in the ad  pick one that looks alive. I just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week  you know. He's just really hoping that boots up and  you know ... And then as the agency explained to me  they said   Look  we don't have little green people in our country  why would we put little green people in our ads  for instance   So  I understand their logic. I totally disagree with it  I think it's a very small minded approach  the world is certainly much more global  and I certainly think the people of Germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer  though we'll never know. This is some work from Ray Gun. And the point of this magazine was to read the articles  listen to the music  and try to interpret it. There's no grid  there's no system  there's nothing set up in advance. This is an opener for Brian Eno  and it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music. This is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school. There's a lot of great writing in  Ray Gun.  And I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books. Article on Bryan Ferry    just really boring article    so I set the whole article in Dingbat. You could    you could highlight it  you could make it Helvetica or something  it is the actual article. I suppose you could eventually decode it  but it's really not very well written  it really wouldn't be worthwhile. Having done a lot of magazines  I'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories  and I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle     . And I was basically pretty disappointed to see that they had chosen to show the photo we'd already seen a million times  which was basically the moment of impact. And People magazine  I thought  got probably the best shot. It's kind of horsey type  but the texture    the second plane not quite hitting  there was something more enticing  if that's the right    it's not the right word    but in this cover than Time or Newsweek. But when I got into this magazine  there's something kind of disturbing  and this continued. On the left we see people dying  we see people running for their lives. And on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast. The coveted right hand page was not given up to the whole issue. Look at the image of this lady    who knows what she's going through     and the copy says   He knows just how to give me goosebumps.  Yeah  he jumps out of buildings. It's    unfortunately  this one works  kind of  as a spread. And this continued through the entire magazine. It did not let up. This says   One clean fits all.  . There were a lot of orphans made this day  and here's a dead body being brought out. It just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more appropriate. And this one I think is possibly the worst  two ladies  both facing the same way  both wearing jeans. One    who knows what she's going through  the other one is worried about model behavior and milk. And    I gave a talk in New York a couple months after this  and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that    they actually emailed me    and they said that they appreciated the talk  and when they got back to their car  they found a note on their car that made them think maybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event    it had been a few months. This was what they found on their car. There's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car  but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back. This is my desktop. Somebody told me today there was this thing called folders  but I don't know what they are. These are my notes for the talk    there might be a correlation here. We are wrapping up. This I saw on the plane  flying in  for hot new products. I'm not sure this is an improvement  or a good idea  because  like  if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer  you can now get a plate in the keyboard  so there's no more faking it    that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway. Now there's a plate  and it would be really  really convenient to get a piece of pizza  then type a little bit  then ... I'm just not sure this is improvement. If you ever doubt the power of graphic design  this is a very generic sign that literally says   Vote for Hitler.  It says nothing else. And this to me is an extreme case of the power of emotion  of graphic design  even though  in fact  was a very generic poster at the time. What's next  What's next is going to be people. As we get more technically driven  the importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before. You have to utilize who you are in your work. Nobody else can do that  nobody else can pull from your background  from your parents  your upbringing  your whole life experience. If you allow that to happen  it's really the only way you can do some unique work  and you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well. This is    I like found art  hand lettering's coming back in a big way  and I thought this was a great example of both. This lady's advertising for her lost pit bull. It's friendly    she's underlined friendly    that's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can't spell. But more importantly  she's willing to give you    bucks to go find this lost pit bull. And I'm thinking  yeah  right  I'll go look for a lost pit bill for    bucks. I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles  and you get charged by this thing and you go  oh  please be Hercles  please be the friendly one. I'm sure she never found the dog  because I took the sign. But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back. And the theme was courage  and they asked me to talk about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer. And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father  who was a test pilot  and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot  they told you that there was a    to    percent chance of death on the job. That's pretty high for most occupations. But  you know  the government would make a plane  they'd say  go see if that one flies  would you  Some of them did  some of them didn't. And I started thinking about some of these decisions I have to make between  like  serif versus san serif. And for the most part  they're not real life threatening. Why not experiment  Why not have some fun  Why not put some of yourself into the work  And when I was teaching  I used to always ask the students  What's the definition of a good job  And as teachers  after you get all the answers  you like to give them the correct answer. And the best one I've heard    I'm sure some of you have heard this    the definition of a good job is  If you could afford to    if money wasn't an issue    would you be doing that same work  And if you would  you've got a great job. And if you wouldn't  what the heck are you doing  You're going to be dead a really long time. Thank you very much. The future that we will create can be a future that we'll be proud of. I think about this every day  it's quite literally my job. I'm co founder and senior columnist at Worldchanging.com. Alex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late       and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever expanding variety of solutions that are out there  right now and on the near horizon. In a little over two years  we've written up about       items    replicable models  technological tools  emerging ideas    all providing a path to a future that's more sustainable  more equitable and more desirable. Our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional. There are tons of places to go  online and off  if what you want to find is the latest bit of news about just how quickly our hell bound handbasket is moving. We want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it. We focus primarily on the planet's environment  but we also address issues of global development  international conflict  responsible use of emerging technologies  even the rise of the so called Second Superpower and much  much more. The scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad  but that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met and the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so. A quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface  but to give you a sense of what we cover  tools for rapid disaster relief  such as this inflatable concrete shelter  innovative uses of bioscience  such as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines  ultra high efficiency designs for homes and offices  distributed power generation using solar power  wind power  ocean power  other clean energy sources  ultra  ultra high efficiency vehicles of the future  ultra high efficiency vehicles you can get right now  and better urban design  so you don't need to drive as much in the first place  bio mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings  distributed computing projects that will help us model the future of the climate. Also  a number of the topics that we've been talking about this week at TED are things that we've addressed in the past on Worldchanging  cradle to cradle design  MIT's Fab Labs  the consequences of extreme longevity  the One Laptop per Child project  even Gapminder. As a born in the mid     s Gen X er  hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday  I'm naturally inclined to pessimism. But working at Worldchanging has convinced me  much to my own surprise  that successful responses to the world's problems are nonetheless possible. Moreover  I've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success. As Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner has observed   Pessimism is a luxury of good times ... In difficult times  pessimism is a self fulfilling  self inflicted death sentence.  The truth is  we can build a better world  and we can do so right now. We have the tools  we saw a hint of that a moment ago  and we're coming up with new ones all the time. We have the knowledge  and our understanding of the planet improves every day. Most importantly  we have the motive  we have a world that needs fixing  and nobody's going to do it for us. Many of the solutions that I and my colleagues seek out and write up every day have some important aspects in common  transparency  collaboration  a willingness to experiment  and an appreciation of science    or  more appropriately  science  The majority of models  tools and ideas on Worldchanging encompass combinations of these characteristics  so I want to give you a few concrete examples of how these principles combine in world changing ways. We can see world changing values in the emergence of tools to make the invisible visible    that is  to make apparent the conditions of the world around us that would otherwise be largely imperceptible. We know that people often change their behavior when they can see and understand the impact of their actions. As a small example  many of us have experienced the change in driving behavior that comes from having a real time display of mileage showing precisely how one's driving habits affect the vehicle's efficiency. The last few years have all seen the rise of innovations in how we measure and display aspects of the world that can be too big  or too intangible  or too slippery to grasp easily. Simple technologies  like wall mounted devices that display how much power your household is using  and what kind of results you'll get if you turn off a few lights    these can actually have a direct positive impact on your energy footprint. Community tools  like text messaging  that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding  can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion. Data rich displays like maps of campaign contributions  or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps  allow us to better understand the context and the flow of processes that affect us all. We can see world changing values in research projects that seek to meet the world's medical needs through open access to data and collaborative action. Now  some people emphasize the risks of knowledge enabled dangers  but I'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge enabled solutions are far more important. For example  open access journals  like the Public Library of Science  make cutting edge scientific research free to all    everyone in the world. And actually  a growing number of science publishers are adopting this model. Last year  hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers around the world worked together to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible for some of the developing world's worst diseases  African sleeping sickness  leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. That genome data can now be found on open access genetic data banks around the world  and it's an enormous boon to researchers trying to come up with treatments. But my favorite example has to be the global response to the SARS epidemic in             which relied on worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus. The U.S. National Research Council in its follow up report on the outbreak specifically cited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason why the treatment for SARS could be developed so quickly. And we can see world changing values in something as humble as a cell phone. I can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this room who do not use a mobile phone    and where is Aubrey  because I know he doesn't  For many of us  cell phones have really become almost an extension of ourselves  and we're really now beginning to see the social changes that mobile phones can bring about. You may already know some of the big picture aspects  globally  more camera phones were sold last year than any other kind of camera  and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens  and over the network    and sometimes enter history books. In the developing world  mobile phones have become economic drivers. A study last year showed a direct correlation between the growth of mobile phone use and subsequent GDP increases across Africa. In Kenya  mobile phone minutes have actually become an alternative currency. The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either  from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government  to the Blairwatch Project in the UK  keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press. And it's just going to get more wild. Pervasive  always on networks  high quality sound and video  even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket  will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate. It's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone may be among the world's most important technologies. And in this rapidly evolving context  it's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes something far more than a medium for social interaction. I've long admired the Witness project  and Peter Gabriel told us more details about it on Wednesday  in his profoundly moving presentation. And I'm just incredibly happy to see the news that Witness is going to be opening up a Web portal to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones to send in their recordings over the Internet  rather than just hand carrying the videotape. Not only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue for documenting abuses  it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation. Now  imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists. Imagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what's happening to the planet  putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds  from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures. It would highlight the changes that are underway  but would more importantly give voice to the people who are willing to work to see a new world  a better world  come about. It would give everyday citizens a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet. It would be  in essence  an  Earth Witness  project. Now  just to be clear  in this talk I'm using the name  Earth Witness  as part of the scenario  simply as a shorthand  for what this imaginary project could aspire to  not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization. It could just as easily be called   Environmental Transparency Project    Smart Mobs for Natural Security     but Earth Witness is a lot easier to say. Now  many of the people who participate in Earth Witness would focus on ecological problems  human caused or otherwise  especially environmental crimes and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions. That's understandable and important. We need better documentation of what's happening to the planet if we're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage. But the Earth Witness project wouldn't need to be limited to problems. In the best Worldchanging tradition  it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas  successful projects and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility. Earth Witness would show us two worlds  the world we're leaving behind  and the world we're building for generations to come. And what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is we could do it today. The key components are already widely available. Camera phones  of course  would be fundamental to the project. And for a lot of us  they're as close as we have yet to always on  widely available information tools. We may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us wherever we go  but very few of us forget our phones. You could even imagine a version of this scenario in which people actually build their own phones. Over the course of last year  open source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable  Linux based mobile phones  and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project. At the other end of the network  there'd be a server for people to send photos and messages to  accessible over the Web  combining a photo sharing service  social networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system. Now  you Web  .  folks in the audience know what I'm talking about  but for those of you for whom that last sentence was in a crazy moon language  I mean simply this  the online part of the Earth Witness project would be created by the users  working together and working openly. That's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle of what's now happening to our planet  but we could do more. An Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet picked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone. Now  you don't see these devices as add ons for phones yet  but students and engineers around the world have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons    that being a project that's actually underway right now at U.C. Irvine  using bird mounted sensors as a way of measuring smog forming pollution. It's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing on a phone carried by a person. Now  the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new  phone makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath  or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure. Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical  more seriously  makes a mobile phone add on that can process blood tests in the field  uploading the data  displaying the results. Even the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act  designing a prototype phone that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs. Now  there's an enormous variety of tiny  inexpensive sensors on the market  and you can easily imagine someone putting together a phone that could measure temperature  CO  or methane levels  the presence of some biotoxins    potentially  in a few years  maybe even H N  avian flu virus. You could see that some kind of system like this would actually be a really good fit with Larry Brilliant's InSTEDD project. Now  all of this data could be tagged with geographic information and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis. And that's worth noting in particular. The impact of open access online maps over the last year or two has been simply phenomenal. Developers around the world have come up with an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps  from bus routes and crime statistics to the global progress of avian flu. Earth Witness would take this further  linking what you see with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world. It's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished if something like this ever existed. We'd have a far better    far better knowledge of what's happening on our planet environmentally than could be gathered with satellites and a handful of government sensor nets alone. It would be a collaborative  bottom up approach to environmental awareness and protection  able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way    and if you need greater sensor density  just have more people show up. And most important  you can't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth. This is a system that could put the next generation at the front lines of gathering environmental data. And as we work to figure out ways to mitigate the worst effects of climate disruption  every little bit of information matters. A system like Earth Witness would be a tool for all of us to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and  ultimately  the improvement of the planet itself. Now  as I suggested at the outset  there are thousands upon thousands of good ideas out there  so why have I spent the bulk of my time telling you about something that doesn't exist  Because this is what tomorrow could look like  bottom up  technology enabled global collaboration to handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced. We can save the planet  but we can't do it alone    we need each other. Nobody's going to fix the world for us  but working together  making use of technological innovations and human communities alike  we might just be able to fix it ourselves. We have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models  powerful tools  and innovative ideas that can make a meaningful difference in our planet's future. We don't need to wait for a magic bullet to save us all  we already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used. There's a staggering array of wonders out there  across diverse disciplines  all telling us the same thing  success can be ours if we're willing to try. And as we say at Worldchanging  another world isn't just possible  another world is here. We just need to open our eyes. Thank you very much. What's happening in genomics  and how this revolution is about to change everything we know about the world  life  ourselves  and how we think about them. If you saw       A Space Odyssey  and you heard the boom  boom  boom  boom  and you saw the monolith  you know  that was Arthur C. Clarke's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species. In this case  it was picking up bones and creating a tool  using it as a tool  which meant that apes just  sort of  running around and eating and doing each other figured out they can make things if they used a tool. And that moved us to the next level. And  you know  we in the last    years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology  and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools. And we've seen many seminal moments. We've seen the creation of small computers in the '  s and early '  s  and who would have thought back then that every single person would not have just one computer but probably     in your home  and in not just your P.C. but in every device    in your washing machine  your cell phone. You're walking around  your car has    microprocessors. Then we go along and create the Internet and connect the world together  we flatten the world. We've seen so much change  and we've given ourselves these tools now    these high powered tools    that are allowing us to turn the lens inward into something that is common to all of us  and that is a genome. How's your genome today  Have you thought about it lately  Heard about it  at least  You probably hear about genomes these days. I thought I'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is. It's  sort of  like if you ask people  Well  what is a megabyte or megabit  And what is broadband  People never want to say  I really don't understand. So  I will tell you right off of the bat. You've heard of DNA  you probably studied a little bit in biology. A genome is really a description for  all of the DNA that is in a living organism. And one thing that is common to all of life is DNA. It doesn't matter whether you're a yeast  it doesn't matter whether you're a mouse  doesn't matter whether you're a fly  we all have DNA. The DNA is organized in words  call them  genes and chromosomes. And when Watson and Crick in the '  s first decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule    very long  complicated molecule    we then started on this journey to understand that inside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics  our traits  what we inherit  what diseases we may get. We've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule  that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever  since the beginning of us  of us as creatures. There is a historical archive. Living in your genome is the history of our species  and you as an individual human being  where you're from  going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years  and that's now starting to be understood. But also  the genome is really the instruction manual. It is the program. It is the code of life. It is what makes you function  it is what makes every organism function. DNA is a very elegant molecule. It's long and it's complicated. Really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters  A  T  C  G  they represent the name of a chemical. And with these four letters  you can create a language  a language that can describe anything  and very complicated things. You know  they are generally put together in pairs  creating a word or what we call base pairs. And you would  you know  when you think about it  four letters  or the representation of four things  makes us work. And that may not sound very intuitive  but let me flip over to something else you know about  and that's computers. Look at this screen here and  you know  you see pictures and you see words  but really all there are are ones and zeros. The language of technology is binary  you've probably heard that at some point in time. Everything that happens in digital is converted  or a representation  of a one and a zero. So  when you're listening to iTunes and your favorite music  that's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly. When you're seeing these pictures  it's all ones and zeros  and when you're talking on your telephone  your cell phone  and it's going over the network  your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whizzed around. And look at all the complex things and wonderful things we've been able to create with just a one and a zero. Well  now you ramp that up to four  and you have a lot of complexity  a lot of ways to describe mechanisms. So  let's talk about what that means. So  if you look at a human genome  they consist of  .  billion of these base pairs. That's a lot. And they mix up in all different fashions  and that makes you a human being. If you convert that to binary  just to give you a little bit of sizing  we're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office. It's not really all that much data. I will also tell you we're at least as buggy. This here is a bug in my genome that I have struggled with for a long  long time. When you get sick  it is a bug in your genome. In fact  many  many diseases we have struggled with for a long time  like cancer  we haven't been able to cure because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level. We are starting to understand that. So  up to this point we tried to fix it by using what I call shit against the wall pharmacology  which means  well  let's just throw chemicals at it  and maybe it's going to make it work. But if you really understand why does a cell go from normal cell to cancer  What is the code  What are the exact instructions that are making it do that  then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out. So  for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine  here's a few factoids for you. We actually have about        genes that do things. We have about a hundred          others that don't appear to function every day  but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species going back tens of thousands of years. You might also be interested in knowing that a mouse has about the same amount of genes. They recently sequenced Pinot Noir  and it also has about        genes  so the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity or the evolutionary order of any particular species. Now  look around  just look next to your neighbor  look forward  look backward. We all look pretty different. A lot of very handsome and pretty people here  skinny  chubby  different races  cultures. We are all   .   genetically equal. It is one one hundredth of one percent of genetic material that makes the difference between any one of us. That's a tiny amount of material  but the way that ultimately expresses itself is what makes changes in humans and in all species. So  we are now able to read genomes. The first human genome took    years  three billion dollars. It was done by Dr. Craig Venter. And then James Watson's    one of the co founders of DNA    genome was done for two million dollars  and in just two months. And if you think about the computer industry and how we've gone from big computers to little ones and how they get more powerful and faster all the time  the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now  we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes for about       dollars in about an hour or a half hour  you will see that happen in the next five years. And what that means is  you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card. It will be here. And when you buy medicine  you won't be buying a drug that's used for everybody. You will give your genome to the pharmacist  and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were    you won't have side effects. All those side effects  you know  oily residue and  you know  whatever they say in those commercials  forget about that. They're going to make all that stuff go away. What does a genome look like  Well  there it is. It is a long  long series of these base pairs. If you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this  but what scientists are doing now is they're understanding what these do and what they mean. Because what Nature is doing is double clicking all the time. In other words  the first couple of sentences here  assuming this is a grape plant  make a root  make a branch  create a blossom. In a human being  down in here it could be  make blood cells  start cancer. For me it may be  every calorie you consume  you conserve  because I come from a very cold climate. For my wife  eat three times as much and you never put on any weight. It's all hidden in this code  and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace. So  what can we do with genomes now that we can read them  now that we're starting to have the book of life  Well  there's many things. Some are exciting. Some people will find very scary. I will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me  but that's okay. So  you know  we now can learn the history of organisms. You can do a very simple test  scrape your cheek  send it off. You can find out where your relatives come from  you can do your genealogy going back thousands of years. We can understand functionality. This is really important. We can understand  for example  why we create plaque in our arteries  what creates the starchiness inside of a grain  why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide. We can also look at  at a grander scale  what creates problems  what creates disease  and how we may be able to fix them. Because we can understand this  we can fix them  make better organisms. Most importantly  what we're learning is that Nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox. The toolbox exists. An architect far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox  and we now have the ability to use it. We are now not just reading genomes  we are writing them. This company  Synthetic Genomics  I'm involved with  created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug  a very primitive creature called Mycoplasma genitalium. If you have a UTI  you've probably    or ever had a UTI    you've come in contact with this little bug. Very simple    only has about     genes    but we were able to completely synthesize that genome. Now  you have the genome and you say to yourself  So  if I plug this synthetic genome    if I pull the old one out and plug it in    does it just boot up and live  Well  guess what. It does. Not only does it do that  if you took the genome    that synthetic genome    and you plugged it into a different critter  like yeast  you now turn that yeast into Mycoplasma. It's  sort of  like booting up a PC with a Mac O.S. software. Well  actually  you could do it the other way. So  you know  by being able to write a genome and plug it into an organism  the software  if you will  changes the hardware. And this is extremely profound. So  last year the French and Italians announced they got together and they went ahead and they sequenced Pinot Noir. The genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism  and they identified  once again  about        genes. They have discovered pathways that create flavors  although it's very important to understand that those compounds that it's cranking out have to match a receptor in our genome  in our tongue  for us to understand and interpret those flavors. They've also discovered that there's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well. They've identified areas of vulnerability to disease. They now are understanding  and the work is going on  exactly how this plant works  and we have the capability to know  to read that entire code and understand how it ticks. So  then what do you do  Knowing that we can read it  knowing that we can write it  change it  maybe write its genome from scratch. So  what do you do  Well  one thing you could do is what some people might call Franken Noir. We can build a better vine. By the way  just so you know  you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms  there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere that is not genetically modified. They're not grown from seeds  they're grafted into root stock  they would not exist in nature on their own. So  don't worry about  don't stress about that stuff. We've been doing this forever. So  we could  you know  focus on disease resistance  we can go for higher yields without necessarily having dramatic farming techniques to do it  or costs. We could conceivably expand the climate window  we could make Pinot Noir grow maybe in Long Island  God forbid. We could produce better flavors and aromas. You want a little more raspberry  a little more chocolate here or there  All of these things could conceivably be done  and I will tell you I'd pretty much bet that it will be done. But there's an ecosystem here. In other words  we're not  sort of  unique little organisms running around  we are part of a big ecosystem. In fact    I'm sorry to inform you    that inside of your digestive tract is about    pounds of microbes which you're circulating through your body quite a bit. Our ocean's teaming with microbes  in fact  when Craig Venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean  in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet by discovering all new microbes in the first    feet of water. We now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate and regulating CO  and oxygen than plants do  which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere. We find microbial life in every part of the planet  in ice  in coal  in rocks  in volcanic vents  it's an amazing thing. But we've also discovered  when it comes to plants  in plants  as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes  it is the ecosystem around them  it is the microbes that live in their root systems  that have just as much impact on the character of those plants as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves. If you take a closer look at a root system  you will find there are many  many  many diverse microbial colonies. This is not big news to viticulturists  they have been  you know  concerned with water and fertilization. And  again  this is  sort of  my notion of shit against the wall pharmacology  you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in. You don't necessarily know with granularity exactly what organisms are providing what flavors and what characteristics. We can start to figure that out. We all talk about terroir  we worship terroir  we say  Wow  is my terroir great  It's so special. I've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe. Well  you know  we really  we argue and debate about it    we say it's climate  it's soil  it's this. Well  guess what  We can figure out what the heck terroir is. It's in there  waiting to be sequenced. There are thousands of microbes there. They're easy to sequence  unlike a human  they  you know  have a thousand  two thousand genes  we can figure out what they are. All we have to do is go around and sample  dig into the ground  find those bugs  sequence them  correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like    that's just a big database    and then fertilize. And then we understand what is terroir. So  some people will say  Oh  my God  are we playing God  Are we now  if we engineer organisms  are we playing God  And  you know  people would always ask James Watson    he's not always the most politically correct guy ... ... and they would say   Are  you know  are you playing God   And he had the best answer I ever heard to this question   Well  somebody has to.  I consider myself a very spiritual person  and without  you know  the organized religion part  and I will tell you  I don't believe there's anything unnatural. I don't believe that chemicals are unnatural. I told you I'm going to make some of you puke. It's very simple  we don't invent molecules  compounds. They're here. They're in the universe. We reorganize things  we change them around  but we don't make anything unnatural. Now  we can create bad impacts    we can poison ourselves  we can poison the Earth    but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made. So  what's happening today is  Nature is presenting us with a toolbox  and we find that this toolbox is very extensive. There are microbes out there that actually make gasoline  believe it or not. There are microbes  you know    go back to yeast. These are chemical factories  the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by Nature  and we now can use those. There also is a set of rules. Nature will not allow you to    we could engineer a grape plant  but guess what. We can't make the grape plant produce babies. Nature has put a set of rules out there. We can work within the rules  we can't break the rules  we're just learning what the rules are. I just ask the question  if you could cure all disease    if you could make disease go away  because we understand how it actually works  if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious  healthy plants that grow in very hard to grow environments  if we could create clean and plentiful energy    we  right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics  have single celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline. So  carbon dioxide    the stuff we want to get rid of    not sugar  not anything. Carbon dioxide  a little bit of sunlight  you end up with a lipid that is highly refined. We could solve our energy problems  we can reduce CO    we could clean up our oceans  we could make better wine. If we could  would we  Well  you know  I think the answer is very simple  working with Nature  working with this tool set that we now understand  is the next step in humankind's evolution. And all I can tell you is  stay healthy for    years. If you can stay healthy for    years  you'll see      maybe    . Thank you. You know  I am so bad at tech that my daughter    who is now       when she was five  was overheard by me to say to a friend of hers  If it doesn't bleed when you cut it  my daddy doesn't understand it. So  the assignment I've been given may be an insuperable obstacle for me  but I'm certainly going to try. What have I heard during these last four days  This is my third visit to TED. One was to TEDMED  and one  as you've heard  was a regular TED two years ago. I've heard what I consider an extraordinary thing that I've only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs  and what that is is an interweaving and an interlarding  an intermixing  of a sense of social responsibility in so many of the talks    global responsibility  in fact  appealing to enlightened self interest  but it goes far beyond enlightened self interest. One of the most impressive things about what some  perhaps     of the speakers have been talking about is the realization  as you listen to them carefully  that they're not saying  Well  this is what we should do  this is what I would like you to do. It's  This is what I have done because I'm excited by it  because it's a wonderful thing  and it's done something for me and  of course  it's accomplished a great deal. It's the old concept  the real Greek concept  of philanthropy in its original sense  phil anthropy  the love of humankind. And the only explanation I can have for some of what you've been hearing in the last four days is that it arises  in fact  out of a form of love. And this gives me enormous hope. And hope  of course  is the topic that I'm supposed to be speaking about  which I'd completely forgotten about until I arrived. And when I did  I thought  well  I'd better look this word up in the dictionary. So  Sarah and I    my wife    walked over to the public library  which is four blocks away  on Pacific Street  and we got the OED  and we looked in there  and there are    definitions of hope  none of which really hits you between the eyes as being the appropriate one. And  of course  that makes sense  because hope is an abstract phenomenon  it's an abstract idea  it's not a concrete word. Well  it reminds me a little bit of surgery. If there's one operation for a disease  you know it works. If there are    operations  you know that none of them work. And that's the way it is with definitions of words. If you have appendicitis  they take your appendix out  and you're cured. If you've got reflux oesophagitis  there are    procedures  and Joe Schmo does it one way and Will Blow does it another way  and none of them work  and that's the way it is with this word  hope. They all come down to the idea of an expectation of something good that is due to happen. And you know what I found out  The Indo European root of the word hope is a stem  K E U    we would spell it K E U  it's pronounced koy    and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from. But what it means in the original Indo European is a change in direction  going in a different way. And I find that very interesting and very provocative  because what you've been hearing in the last couple of days is the sense of going in different directions  directions that are specific and unique to problems. There are different paradigms. You've heard that word several times in the last four days  and everyone's familiar with Kuhnian paradigms. So  when we think of hope now  we have to think of looking in other directions than we have been looking. There's another    not definition  but description  of hope that has always appealed to me  and it was one by V clav Havel in his perfectly spectacular book  Breaking the Peace   in which he says that hope does not consist of the expectation that things will come out exactly right  but the expectation that they will make sense regardless of how they come out. I can't tell you how reassured I was by the very last sentence in that glorious presentation by Dean Kamen a few days ago. I wasn't sure I heard it right  so I found him in one of the inter sessions. He was talking to a very large man  but I didn't care. I interrupted  and I said   Did you say this   He said   I think so.  So  here's what it is  I'll repeat it.  The world will not be saved by the Internet.  It's wonderful. Do you know what the world will be saved by  I'll tell you. It'll be saved by the human spirit. And by the human spirit  I don't mean anything divine  I don't mean anything supernatural    certainly not coming from this skeptic. What I mean is this ability that each of us has to be something greater than herself or himself  to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of. On an elemental level  we have all felt that spirituality at the time of childbirth. Some of you have felt it in laboratories  some of you have felt it at the workbench. We feel it at concerts. I've felt it in the operating room  at the bedside. It is an elevation of us beyond ourselves. And I think that it's going to be  in time  the elements of the human spirit that we've been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days. And if there's anything that has permeated this room  it is precisely that. I'm intrigued by a concept that was brought to life in the early part of the   th century    actually  in the second decade of the   th century    by a    year old poet whose name was Percy Shelley. Now  we all think that Shelley obviously is the great romantic poet that he was  many of us tend to forget that he wrote some perfectly wonderful essays  too  and the most well remembered essay is one called  A Defence of Poetry.  Now  it's about five  six  seven  eight pages long  and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page  but somewhere on the second page he begins talking about the notion that he calls  moral imagination.  And here's what he says  roughly translated  A man    generic man    a man  to be greatly good  must imagine clearly. He must see himself and the world through the eyes of another  and of many others. See himself and the world    not just the world  but see himself. What is it that is expected of us by the billions of people who live in what Laurie Garrett the other day so appropriately called despair and disparity  What is it that they have every right to ask of us  What is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves  out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit  Well  you know precisely what it is. There's a great deal of argument about whether we  as the great nation that we are  should be the policeman of the world  the world's constabulary  but there should be virtually no argument about whether we should be the world's healer. There has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days. So  if we are to be the world's healer  every disadvantaged person in this world    including in the United States    becomes our patient. Every disadvantaged nation  and perhaps our own nation  becomes our patient. So  it's fun to think about the etymology of the word  patient.  It comes initially from the Latin patior  to endure  or to suffer. So  you go back to the old Indo European root again  and what do you find  The Indo European stem is pronounced payen    we would spell it P A E N    and  lo and behold  mirabile dictu  it is the same root as the word compassion comes from  P A E N. So  the lesson is very clear. The lesson is that our patient    the world  and the disadvantaged of the world    that patient deserves our compassion. But beyond our compassion  and far greater than compassion  is our moral imagination and our identification with each individual who lives in that world  not to think of them as a huge forest  but as individual trees. Of course  in this day and age  the trick is not to let each tree be obscured by that Bush in Washington that can get    can get in the way. So  here we are. We are  should be  morally committed to being the healer of the world. And we have had examples over and over and over again    you've just heard one in the last    minutes    of people who have not only had that commitment  but had the charisma  the brilliance    and I think in this room it's easy to use the word brilliant  my God    the brilliance to succeed at least at the beginning of their quest  and who no doubt will continue to succeed  as long as more and more of us enlist ourselves in their cause. Now  if we're talking about medicine  and we're talking about healing  I'd like to quote someone who hasn't been quoted. It seems to me everybody in the world's been quoted here  Pogo's been quoted  Shakespeare's been quoted backwards  forwards  inside out. I would like to quote one of my own household gods. I suspect he never really said this  because we don't know what Hippocrates really said  but we do know for sure that one of the great Greek physicians said the following  and it has been recorded in one of the books attributed to Hippocrates  and the book is called  Precepts.  And I'll read you what it is. Remember  I have been talking about  essentially philanthropy  the love of humankind  the individual humankind and the individual humankind that can bring that kind of love translated into action  translated  in some cases  into enlightened self interest. And here he is        years ago   Where there is love of humankind  there is love of healing.  We have seen that here today with the sense  with the sensitivity    and in the last three days  and with the power of the indomitable human spirit. Thank you very much. I became an inventor by accident. I was out of the air force in     . No  no  that's not true  I went in in       came out in       was working at the University of Washington  and I came up with an idea  from reading a magazine article  for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm. Now  that was before cassette tapes  C.D.s  DVDs    any of the cool stuff we've got now. And it was an arm that  instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record  went straight  a radial  linear tracking tone arm. And it was the hardest invention I ever made  but it got me started  and I got really lucky after that. And without giving you too much of a tirade  I want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today  my   th invention. No  that's not true either. Golly  I'm just totally losing it. My   th patent  about the   th invention. I call this hypersonic sound. I'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes  but I want to make an analogy before I do to this. I usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say  That's really cool  but what's it good for  And I say  What is the light bulb good for  Sound  light  I'm going to draw the analogy. When Edison invented the light bulb  pretty much looked like this. Hasn't changed that much. Light came out of it in every direction. Before the light bulb was invented  people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it  focus it a little bit  put lenses in front of it  focus it a little bit better. Ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers that were totally focused. Now  think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb  but you couldn't focus light  if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to. That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are. You turn on the loudspeaker  and after almost    years of having those gadgets  the sound just kind of goes where it wants. Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone  it's pretty much every direction. A little bit of differential  but not much. If the light bulb was the way the speaker is  and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it  we wouldn't have that  or movies in general  or computers  or T.V. sets  or C.D.s  or DVDs    and just go down the list of what the importance is of being able to focus light. Now  after almost    years of having sound  I thought it was about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to. I have a couple of units. That guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car    small version  over your head    so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car. What if I could aim sound the way I aim light  I got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard. Now  you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you. Maybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room. The sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool  Because I have some limited time  I'll cut it off for a second  and tell you about how it works and what it's good for. Course  like light  it's great to be able to put sound to highlight a clothing rack  or the cornflakes  or the toothpaste  or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby. Sony's got an idea    Sony's our biggest customers right now. They tried this back in the '  s and were too smart  and so they gave up. But they want to use it    seriously. There's a mix an inventor has to have. You have to be kind of smart  and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid  because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today. Too many other smart people out there. So. I just happened to get my education in a little different way. I'm not at all against education. I think it's wonderful  I think sometimes people  when they get educated  lose it  they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than. And we're living in a great time right now  because almost everything's being explored anew. I have this little slogan that I use a lot  which is  virtually nothing    and I mean this honestly    has been invented yet. We're just starting. We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics. And this is  I hope  a little piece of it. Sony's got this vision back    to get myself on track    that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket  you're going to watch a new T.V. channel. They know that when you watch T.V. at home  because there are so many choices you can change channels  miss their commercials. A hundred and fifty one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket. Now  they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed  because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message every    minutes  and reaches out  turns off the sound. And  you know  if the sound isn't there  the sale typically isn't made. For instance  like  when you're on an airplane  they show the movie  you get to watch it for free  when you want to hear the sound  you pay. And so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket    initially it'll be Safeways. It is Safeways  they're trying this in three parts of the country right now    you'll be watching TV. And hopefully they'll be sensitive that they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet. But what's great about it  from the tests that have been done  is  if you don't want to hear it  you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it. So  we create silence as much as we create sound. ATMs that talk to you  nobody else hears it. Sit in bed  two in the morning  watch TV  your spouse  or someone  is next to you  asleep  doesn't hear it  doesn't wake up. We're also working on noise canceling things like snoring  noise from automobiles. I have been really lucky with this technology  all of a sudden as it is ready  the world is ready to accept it. They have literally beat a path to our door. We've been selling it since about last September  October  and it's been immensely gratifying. If you're interested in what it costs    I'm not selling them today    but this unit  with the electronics and everything  if you buy one  is around a thousand bucks. We expect by this time next year  it'll be hundreds  a few hundred bucks  to buy it. It's not any more pricey than regular electronics. Now  when I played it for you  you didn't hear the thunderous bass. This unit that I played goes from about     hertz to above the range of hearing. It's actually emitting ultrasound    low level ultrasound    that's about         vibrations per second. And the sound that you're hearing  unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face  is made out in front of it  in the air. The air is not linear  as we've always been taught. You turn up the volume just a little bit    I'm talking about a little over    decibels    and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate. Here's why  the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow. It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure. Now  imagine  if you will  without getting too technical  I'm making a little sine wave here in the air. Well  if I turn up the amplitude too much  I'm having an effect on the pressure  which means during the making of that sine wave  the speed at which it is propagating is shifting. All of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear. Linearity means higher quality sound. Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite  it's     percent based on non linearity. An effect happens in the air  it's a corrupting effect of the sound    the ultrasound in this case    that's emitted  but it's so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect. Now  the question is  where's the sound made  Instead of being made on the face of the cone  it's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air  and so when I aim it towards you  what you hear is made right next to your ears. I said we can shorten the column  we can spread it out to cover the couch. I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker  the other ear hears the other. That's true binaural sound. When you listen to stereo on your home system  your both ears hear both speakers. Turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear. So  the stage is more restricted    the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you. Because the sound is made in the air along this column  it does not follow the inverse square law  which says it drops off about two thirds every time you double the distance   dB every time you go from one meter  for instance  to two meters. That means you go to a rock concert or a symphony  and the guy in the front row gets the same level as the guy in the back row  now  all of a sudden. Isn't that terrific  So  we've been  as I say  very successful  very lucky  in having companies catch the vision of this  from cars    car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids  and a separate system in the back    oh  no  the kids aren't driving today. I was seeing if you were listening. Actually  I haven't had breakfast yet. A stereo system in the front for mom and dad  and maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids  and the parents don't want to be bothered with that  or their rap music or whatever. So  again  this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on. It also works for transmitting and communicating data. It also works five times better underwater. We've got the military    have just deployed some of these into Iraq  where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside. Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse. I'm serious. And they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance  and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift from     yards away when they play this thing. And so  another way of hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't. We make a version with this which puts out     decibels. Pain is    . So it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people  and there can be a public beach just off to the side  and they don't even know it's turned on. We sell those to the military presently for about        dollars  and they're buying them as fast as we can make them. We put it on a turret with a camera  so that when they shoot at you  you're over there  and it's there. I have a bunch of other inventions. I invented a plasma antenna  to shift gears. Looked up at the ceiling of my office one day    I was working on a ground penetrating radar project    and my physicist CEO came in and said   We have a real problem. We're using very short wavelengths. We've got a problem with the antenna ringing. When you run very short wavelengths  like a tuning fork the antenna resonates  and there's more energy coming out of the antenna than there is the backscatter from the ground that we're trying to analyze  taking too much processing.  I says   Why don't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it  Turn it on  turn it off. That's a fluorescent tube refined.  I just sold that for a million and a half dollars  cash. I took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified  when the patent issued  and told the people back there about it  and they laughed  and then I took them back a demo and they bought. Any of you ever wore a Jabber headphone    the little cell headphones  That's my invention. I sold that for seven million dollars. Big mistake  it just sold for    million dollars two years ago. I actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer in my attic at my house  and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design I drew way back when. So  I've been really lucky as an inventor. I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet. And my dad died before he realized anybody in the family would maybe  hopefully  make something out of themselves. You've been a great audience. I know I've jumped all over the place. I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group. Let me give you  in the last minute  one more quick demo of this guy  for those of you that haven't heard it. Can never tell if it's on. If you haven't heard it  raise your hand. Getting it over there  Get the cameraman. Yeah  there you go. I've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head  that's really cool. Thank you once again. Appreciate it very much. So  I want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood. I love the science fiction movies. Here it is   This Island Earth.  And leave it to Hollywood to get it just right. Two and a half years in the making. I mean  even the creationists give us        but Hollywood goes to the chase. And in this movie  we see what we think is out there  flying saucers and aliens. Every world has an alien  and every alien world has a flying saucer  and they move about with great speed. Aliens. Well  Don Brownlee  my friend  and I finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the TV and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night  and tried to write a counter argument to it  and put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable  for a planet to be an Earth  to have a place where you could probably get not just life  but complexity  which requires a huge amount of evolution  and therefore constancy of conditions. So  in      we wrote  Rare Earth.  In       we then asked  let's not think about where Earths are in space  but how long has Earth been Earth  If you go back two billion years  you're not on an Earth like planet any more. What we call an Earth like planet is actually a very short interval of time. Well   Rare Earth  actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public. Right after  I got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention  and with all great earnestness walked in. David Brin was going to debate me on this  and as I walked in  the crowd of a hundred started booing lustily. I had a girl who came up who said   My dad says you're the devil.  You cannot take people's aliens away from them and expect to be anybody's friends. Well  the second part of that  soon after    and I was talking to Paul Allen  I saw him in the audience  and I handed him a copy of  Rare Earth.  And Jill Tarter was there  and she turned to me  and she looked at me just like that girl in  The Exorcist.  It was   It burns  It burns   Because SETI doesn't want to hear this. SETI wants there to be stuff out there. I really applaud the SETI efforts  but we have not heard anything yet. And I really do think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't. Now  I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that  even if SETI does hear something  can we figure out what they said  Because this was a slide that was passed between the two major intelligences on Earth    a Mac to a PC    and it can't even get the letters right       so how are we going to talk to the aliens  And if they're    light years away  and we call them up  and you blah  blah  blah  blah  blah  and then    years later it comes back and they say  Please repeat  I mean  there we are. Our planet is a good planet because it can keep water. Mars is a bad planet  but it's still good enough for us to go there and to live on its surface if we're protected. But Venus is a very bad    the worst    planet. Even though it's Earth like  and even though early in its history it may very well have harbored Earth like life  it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse    that's an     degrees  Fahrenheit  surface    because of rampant carbon dioxide. Well  we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what's going to happen to our particular planet. We are right now in the beautiful Oreo of existence    of at least life on Planet Earth    following the first horrible microbial age. In the Cambrian explosion  life emerged from the swamps  complexity arose  and from what we can tell  we're halfway through. We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now  till we hit the second microbial age. And that will happen  paradoxically    everything you hear about global warming    when we hit CO  down to    parts per million  we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis  and there go animals. So  after that we probably have seven billion years. The Sun increases in its intensity  in its brightness  and finally  at about    billion years after it first started  the Earth is consumed by a large Sun  and this is what's left. So  a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age  and we are in its golden summer age right now. But there's two fates to everything  isn't there  Now  a lot of you are going to die of old age  but some of you  horribly enough  are going to die in an accident. And that's the fate of a planet  too. Earth  if we're lucky enough    if it doesn't get hit by a Hale Bopp  or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years    we'll find under your feet. But what about accidental death  Well  paleontologists for the last     years have been charting death. It's strange    extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about until Baron Cuvier in France found this first mastodon. He couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet  and he said  Aha  It's extinct. And very soon after  the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been since complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record. In that complex record of fossils  there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly  and the father mother geologists called these  mass extinctions.  All along it was thought to be either an act of God or perhaps long  slow climate change  and that really changed in       in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio  where Walter Alvarez  trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks  which held creatures of the Cretaceous period  and the pink rocks above  which held Tertiary fossils. How long did it take to go from one system to the next  And what they found was something unexpected. They found in this gap  in between  a very thin clay layer  and that clay layer    this very thin red layer here    is filled with iridium. And not just iridium  it's filled with glassy spherules  and it's filled with quartz grains that have been subjected to enormous pressure  shock quartz. Now  in this slide the white is chalk  and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean. The chalk itself's composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor  so that    percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff  and then you have that millimeter thick red layer  and then you have black rock. And the black rock is the sediment on the sea bottom in the absence of plankton. And that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe  because that's what this was  of course. This is the famous K T. A    kilometer body hit the planet. The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet  and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs  the death of these beautiful ammonites  Leconteiceras here  and Celaeceras over here  and so much else. I mean  it must be true  because we've had two Hollywood blockbusters since that time  and this paradigm  from      to about       totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes. Prior to that  uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm  the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past  there are present day processes that will explain it. But we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact  so this is a type of neo catastrophism  and it took about    years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips  yes  we were hit  and yes  the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction. Well  there are five major mass extinctions over the last     million years  called the Big Five. They range from     million years ago to the last  the K T  number four  but the biggest of all was the P  or the Permian extinction  sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions. And every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large body impact. But is this true  The most recent  the Permian  was thought to have been an impact because of this beautiful structure on the right. This is a Buckminsterfullerene  a carbon   . Because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes of my late beloved '  s  they're called  buckyballs.  This evidence was used to suggest that at the end of the Permian      million years ago  a comet hit us. And when the comet hits  the pressure produces the buckyballs  and it captures bits of the comet. Helium    very rare on the surface of the Earth  very common in space. But is this true  In       working on the K T extinction for    years  I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year in the great Karoo desert. I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa into the new South Africa as I went year by year. And I worked on this Permian extinction  camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time. And the fossils are extraordinary. You know  you're gazing upon your very distant ancestors. These are mammal like reptiles. They are culturally invisible. We do not make movies about these. This is a Gorgonopsian  or a Gorgon. That's an    inch long skull of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet  sprawled like a lizard  probably had a head like a lion. This is the top carnivore  the T Rex of its time. But there's lots of stuff. This is my poor son  Patrick. This is called paleontological child abuse. Hold still  you're the scale. There was big stuff back then. Fifty five species of mammal like reptiles. The age of mammals had well and truly started     million years ago ... ... and then a catastrophe happened. And what happens next is the age of dinosaurs. It was all a mistake  it should have never happened. But it did. Now  luckily  this Thrinaxodon  the size of a robin egg here  this is a skull I've discovered just before taking this picture    there's a pen for scale  it's really tiny    this is in the Lower Triassic  after the mass extinction has finished. You can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front. If that does not survive  I'm not the thing giving this talk. Something else is  because if that doesn't survive  we are not here  there are no mammals. It's that close  one species ekes through. Well  can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't  Here's sort of the end of that    years of work. The ranges of stuff    the red line is the mass extinction. But we've got survivors and things that get through  and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold bloods. Warm blooded animals take a huge hit at this time. The survivors that do get through produce this world of crocodile like creatures. There's no dinosaurs yet  just this slow  saurian  scaly  nasty  swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes. And there they would hide for     million years  until liberated by that K T asteroid. So  if not impact  what  And the what  I think  is that we returned  over and over again  to the Pre Cambrian world  that first microbial age  and the microbes are still out there. They hate we animals. They really want their world back. And they've tried over and over and over again. This suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti Gaian. This whole Gaia idea  that life makes the world better for itself    anybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Gaia theory  No. So  I really suspect there's an alternative  and that life does actually try to do itself in    not consciously  but just because it does. And here's the weapon  it seems  that it did so over the last     million years. There are microbes which  through their metabolism  produce hydrogen sulfide  and they do so in large amounts. Hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans. As small as     parts per million will kill you. You only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places    some lakes    and get down  and you'll find that the water itself turns purple. It turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide  and we can detect their presence today    we can see them    but we can also detect their presence in the past. And the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand new field. I am almost extinct    I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils. But the new wave of paleontologists    my graduate students    collect biomarkers. They take the sediment itself  they extract the oil from it  and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups. It's because lipids are so tough  they can get preserved in sediment and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary  and be extracted and tell us who was there. And we know who was there. At the end of the Permian  at many of these mass extinction boundaries  this is what we find  isorenieratene. It's very specific. It can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen  and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide    enough  for instance  to come out of solution. This led Lee Kump  and others from Penn State and my group  to propose what I call the Kump Hypothesis  many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen  by high CO . And the worst effect of global warming  it turns out  hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans. Well  what's the source of this  In this particular case  the source over and over has been flood basalts. This is a view of the Earth now  if we extract a lot of it. And each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb  actually  the effects are even worse. This is when deep Earth material comes to the surface  spreads out over the surface of the planet. Well  it's not the lava that kills anything  it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it. This isn't Volvos  this is volcanoes. But carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide. So  these are new data Rob Berner and I    from Yale    put together  and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record    and we can do this from a variety of means    and put all the red lines here  when these    what I call greenhouse mass extinctions    took place. And there's two things that are really evident here to me  is that these extinctions take place when CO  is going up. But the second thing that's not shown on here  the Earth has never had any ice on it when we've had       parts per million CO . We are at     and climbing. We should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most  but my friend David Battisti in Seattle says he thinks a     years. So  there goes the ice caps  and there comes     feet of sea level rise. I live in a view house now  I'm going to have waterfront. All right  what's the consequence  The oceans probably turn purple. And we think this is the reason that complexity took so long to take place on planet Earth. We had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period. They stop complex life from existing. We know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet. And I throw this slide in    this is me  actually  two months ago    and I throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal  chambered nautilus. It's been on this planet since the animals first started        million years. This is a tracking experiment  and any of you scuba divers  if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever  this is off the Great Barrier Reef. And as we speak now  these nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us. But the thing about this is that every once in a while we divers can run into trouble  so I'm going to do a little thought experiment here. This is a Great White Shark that ate some of my traps. We pulled it up  up it comes. So  it's out there with me at night. So  I'm swimming along  and it takes off my leg. I'm    miles from shore  what's going to happen to me  Well now  I die. Five years from now  this is what I hope happens to me  I'm taken back to the boat  I'm given a gas mask     parts per million hydrogen sulfide. I'm then thrown in an ice pond  I'm cooled    degrees lower and I could be taken to a critical care hospital. And the reason I could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events  and our bodies have adapted. And we can now use this as what I think will be a major medical breakthrough. This is Mark Roth. He was funded by DARPA. Tried to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries. He bleeds out pigs. He puts in    parts per million hydrogen sulfide    the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions    and he turns a mammal into a reptile.  I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to H S.  I got this email from him two years ago  he said   I think I've got an answer to some of your questions.  So  he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours  sometimes six hours  and these are brand new data he sent me on the way over here. On the top  now  that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through    the dotted line  the temperatures. So  the temperature starts at    centigrade  and down it goes  down it goes. Six hours later  up goes the temperature. Now  the same mouse is given    parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph  and look what happens to its temperature. Its temperature drops. It goes down to    degrees centigrade from     and comes out of this perfectly fine. Here is a way we can get people to critical care. Here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care. Now  you're all thinking  yeah  what about the brain tissue  And so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen. You're in an accident. You've got two choices  you're going to die  or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and  say     percent of you is saved  mentally. What are you going to do  Do we all have to have a little button saying  Let me die  This is coming towards us  and I think this is going to be a revolution. We're going to save lives  but there's going to be a cost to it. The new view of mass extinctions is  yes  we were hit  and  yes  we have to think about the long term  because we will get hit again. But there's a far worse danger confronting us. We can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world. Give us a few millennia    and we humans should last those few millennia    will it happen again  If we continue  it'll happen again. How many of us flew here  How many of us have gone through our entire Kyoto quota just for flying this year  How many of you have exceeded it  Yeah  I've certainly exceeded it. We have a huge problem facing us as a species. We have to beat this. I want to be able to go back to this reef. Thank you. Chris Anderson  I've just got one question for you  Peter. Am I understanding you right  that what you're saying here is that we have in our own bodies a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change  Peter Ward  Yeah  every single cell in us can produce minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises. This is what Roth has found out. So  what we're looking at now  does it leave a signal  Does it leave a signal in bone or in plant  And we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past. CA  It's simultaneously an incredible medical technique  but also a terrifying ... PW  Blessing and curse. Sheryl Shade  Hi  Aimee. Aimee Mullins  Hi. SS  Aimee and I thought we'd just talk a little bit  and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete. AM  Well  for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio    it might have given it away    I'm a double amputee  and I was born without fibulas in both legs. I was amputated at age one  and I've been running like hell ever since  all over the place. SS  Well  why don't you tell them how you got to Georgetown    why don't we start there  Why don't we start there  AM  I'm a senior in Georgetown in the Foreign Service program. I won a full academic scholarship out of high school. They pick three students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs  and so I won a full ride to Georgetown and I've been there for four years. Love it. SS  When Aimee got there  she decided that she's  kind of  curious about track and field  so she decided to call someone and start asking about it. So  why don't you tell that story  AM  Yeah. Well  I guess I've always been involved in sports. I played softball for five years growing up. I skied competitively throughout high school  and I got a little restless in college because I wasn't doing anything for about a year or two sports wise. And I'd never competed on a disabled level  you know    I'd always competed against other able bodied athletes. That's all I'd ever known. In fact  I'd never even met another amputee until I was   . And I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners  and I figured   Oh  I don't know about this  but before I judge it  let me go see what it's all about.  So  I booked myself a flight to Boston in '       years old and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race. I'd never done it before. I went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet to see how far I could run  and about    meters was enough for me  panting and heaving. And I had these legs that were made of a wood and plastic compound  attached with Velcro straps    big  thick  five ply wool socks on    you know  not the most comfortable things  but all I'd ever known. And I'm up there in Boston against people wearing legs made of all things    carbon graphite and  you know  shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things    and they're all looking at me like  OK  we know who's not going to win this race. And  I mean  I went up there expecting    I don't know what I was expecting    but  you know  when I saw a man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump  hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet  two inches ... Dan O'Brien jumped  '    in '   in Atlanta  I mean  if it just gives you a comparison of    these are truly accomplished athletes  without qualifying that word  athlete.  And so I decided to give this a shot  heart pounding  I ran my first race and I beat the national record holder by three hundredths of a second  and became the new national record holder on my first try out. And  you know  people said   Aimee  you know  you've got speed    you've got natural speed    but you don't have any skill or finesse going down that track. You were all over the place. We all saw how hard you were working.  And so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown. And I thank god I didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world. He's coached five Olympians  and the man's office is lined from floor to ceiling with All America certificates of all these athletes he's coached. He's just a rather intimidating figure. And I called him up and said   Listen  I ran one race and I won ...   I want to see if I can  you know    I need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices  see what drills you do and whatever.  That's all I wanted    just two practices.  Can I just sit in and see what you do   And he said   Well  we should meet first  before we decide anything.  You know  he's thinking   What am I getting myself into   So  I met the man  walked in his office  and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached. And we got to talking  and it turned out to be a great partnership because he'd never coached a disabled athlete  so therefore he had no preconceived notions of what I was or wasn't capable of  and I'd never been coached before. So this was like   Here we go    let's start on this trip.  So he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break  his free time  and I would come up to the track and train with him. So that's how I met Frank. That was fall of '  . But then  by the time that winter was rolling around  he said   You know  you're good enough. You can run on our women's track team here.  And I said   No  come on.  And he said   No  no  really. You can. You can run with our women's track team.  In the spring of       with my goal of making the U.S. Paralympic team that May coming up full speed  I joined the women's track team. And no disabled person had ever done that    run at a collegiate level. So I don't know  it started to become an interesting mix. SS  Well  on your way to the Olympics  a couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown. Why don't you just tell them  AM  Yes  well  you know  I'd won everything as far as the disabled meets    everything I competed in    and  you know  training in Georgetown and knowing that I was going to have to get used to seeing the backs of all these women's shirts    you know  I'm running against the next Flo Jo    and they're all looking at me like   Hmm  what's  you know  what's going on here   And putting on my Georgetown uniform and going out there and knowing that  you know  in order to become better    and I'm already the best in the country    you know  you have to train with people who are inherently better than you. And I went out there and made it to the Big East  which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season. It was really  really hot. And it's the first    I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio  and I didn't realize at that time that the amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock    it actually acted like a lubricant and I'd be  kind of  pistoning in the socket. And at about    meters of my     meters sprint  in all my glory  I came out of my leg. Like  I almost came out of it  in front of  like        people. And I  I mean  was just mortified    because I was signed up for the      you know  which went off in a half hour. I went to my coach   Please  don't make me do this.  I can't do this in front of all those people. My legs will come off. And if it came off at    there's no way I'm going     meters. And he just sat there like this. My pleas fell on deaf ears  thank god. Because you know  the man is from Brooklyn  he's a big man. He says   Aimee  so what if your leg falls off  You pick it up  you put the damn thing back on  and finish the goddamn race   And I did. So  he kept me in line. He kept me on the right track. SS  So  then Aimee makes it to the      Paralympics  and she's all excited. Her family's coming down    it's a big deal. It's now two years that you've been running  AM  No  a year. SS  A year. And why don't you tell them what happened right before you go run your race  AM  Okay  well  Atlanta. The Paralympics  just for a little bit of clarification  are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities    amputees  persons with cerebral palsy  and wheelchair athletes    as opposed to the Special Olympics  which deals with people with mental disabilities. So  here we are  a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta  and I'm just blown away by the fact that just a year ago  I got out on a gravel track and couldn't run    meters. And so  here I am    never lost. I set new records at the U.S. Nationals    the Olympic trials    that May  and was sure that I was coming home with the gold. I was also the only  what they call  bilateral BK     below the knee. I was the only woman who would be doing the long jump. I had just done the long jump  and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says   How do you do that  You know  we're supposed to have a planar foot  so we can't get off on the springboard.  I said   Well  I just did it. No one told me that.  So  it's funny    I'm three inches within the world record    and kept on from that point  you know  so I'm signed up in the long jump    signed up  No  I made it for the long jump and the     meter. And I'm sure of it  you know  I made the front page of my hometown paper that I delivered for six years  you know  It was  like  this is my time for shine. And we're at the trainee warm up track  which is a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium. These legs that I was on  which I'll take out right now    I was the first person in the world on these legs. I was the guinea pig.  I'm telling you  this was  like    talk about a tourist attraction. Everyone was taking pictures     What is this girl running on   And I'm always looking around  like  where is my competition  It's my first international meet. I tried to get it out of anybody I could  you know   Who am I running against here    Oh  Aimee  we'll have to get back to you on that one.  I wanted to find out times.  Don't worry  you're doing great.  This is    minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium  and they post the heat sheets. And I go over and look. And my fastest time  which was the world record  was   .  . Then I'm looking  the next lane  lane two  is   . . Lane three is   . . Lane four is   . . I said   What's going on   And they shove us all into the shuttle bus  and all the women there are missing a hand. So  I'm just  like    they're all looking at me like 'which one of these is not like the other ' you know  I'm sitting there  like   Oh  my god. Oh  my god.  You know  I'd never lost anything  like  whether it would be the scholarship or  you know  I'd won five golds when I skied. In everything  I came in first. And Georgetown    that was great. I was losing  but it was the best training because this was Atlanta. Here we are  like  cr me de la cr me  and there is no doubt about it  that I'm going to lose big. And  you know  I'm just thinking   Oh  my god  my whole family got in a van and drove down here from Pennsylvania.  And  you know  I was the only female U.S. sprinter. So they call us out and  you know     Ladies  you have one minute.  And I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd  like  the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see. And I'm like   I know  Look  This isn't right.  And I'm thinking that's my last card to play here  if I'm not going to beat these girls  I'm going to mess their heads a little  you know  I mean  it was definitely the  Rocky IV  sensation of me versus Germany  and everyone else    Estonia and Poland    was in this heat. And the gun went off  and all I remember was finishing last and fighting back tears of frustration and incredible    incredible    this feeling of just being overwhelmed. And I had to think   Why did I do this   If I had won everything    but it was like  what was the point  All this training    I had transformed my life. I became a collegiate athlete  you know. I became an Olympic athlete. And it made me really think about how the achievement was getting there. I mean  the fact that I set my sights  just a year and three months before  on becoming an Olympic athlete and saying   Here's my life going in this direction    and I want to take it here for a while  and just seeing how far I could push it.  And the fact that I asked for help    how many people jumped on board  How many people gave of their time and their expertise  and their patience  to deal with me  And that was this collective glory    that there was  you know     people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta. So  I apply this sort of philosophy now to everything I do  sitting back and realizing the progression  how far you've come at this day to this goal  you know. It's important to focus on a goal  I think  but also recognize the progression on the way there and how you've grown as a person. That's the achievement  I think. That's the real achievement. SS  Why don't you show them your legs  AM  Oh  sure. SS  You know  show us more than one set of legs. AM  Well  these are my pretty legs. No  these are my cosmetic legs  actually  and they're absolutely beautiful. You've got to come up and see them. There are hair follicles on them  and I can paint my toenails. And  seriously  like  I can wear heels. Like  you guys don't understand what that's like to be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want. SS  You got to pick your height  AM  I got to pick my height  exactly. Patrick Ewing  who played for Georgetown in the '  s  comes back every summer. And I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he'd come in with foot injuries. I'm like   Get it off  Don't worry about it  you know. You can be eight feet tall. Just take them off.  He didn't find it as humorous as I did  anyway. OK  now  these are my sprinting legs  made of carbon graphite  like I said  and I've got to make sure I've got the right socket. No  I've got so many legs in here. These are    do you want to hold that actually  That's another leg I have for  like  tennis and softball. It has a shock absorber in it so it  like   Shhhh   makes this neat sound when you jump around on it. All right. And then this is the silicon sheath I roll over  to keep it on. Which  when I sweat  you know  I'm pistoning out of it. SS  Are you a different height  AM  In these  SS  In these. AM  I don't know. I don't think so. I may be a little taller. I actually can put both of them on. SS  She can't really stand on these legs. She has to be moving  so ... AM  Yeah  I definitely have to be moving  and balance is a little bit of an art in them. But without having the silicon sock  I'm just going to try slip in it. And so  I run on these  and have shocked half the world on these. These are supposed to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run. If you ever watch a sprinter  the ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track. So when I stand in these legs  my hamstring and my glutes are contracted  as they would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet. AM  It's a company in San Diego called Flex Foot. And I was a guinea pig  as I hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out. But actually these  like I said  are still the actual prototype. I need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at  they were everywhere. You know  it's like a big    it's come full circle. Moderator  Aimee and the designer of them will be at TEDMED    and we'll talk about the design of them. AM  Yes  we'll do that. SS  Yes  there you go. AM  So  these are the sprint legs  and I can put my other... SS  Can you tell about who designed your other legs  AM  Yes. These I got in a place called Bournemouth  England  about two hours south of London  and I'm the only person in the United States with these  which is a crime because they are so beautiful. And I don't even mean  like  because of the toes and everything. For me  while I'm such a serious athlete on the track  I want to be feminine off the track  and I think it's so important not to be limited in any capacity  whether it's  you know  your mobility or even fashion. I mean  I love the fact that I can go in anywhere and pick out what I want    the shoes I want  the skirts I want    and I'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people. They're also silicon. This is a really basic  basic prosthetic limb under here. It's like a Barbie foot under this. It is. It's just stuck in this position  so I have to wear a two inch heel. And  I mean  it's really    let me take this off so you can see it. I don't know how good you can see it  but  like  it really is. There're veins on the feet  and then my heel is pink  and my Achilles' tendon    that moves a little bit. And it's really an amazing store. I got them a year and two weeks ago. And this is just a silicon piece of skin. I mean  what happened was  two years ago this man in Belgium was saying   God  if I can go to Madame Tussauds' wax museum and see Jerry Hall replicated down to the color of her eyes  looking so real as if she breathed  why can't they build a limb for someone that looks like a leg  or an arm  or a hand   I mean  they make ears for burn victims. They do amazing stuff with silicon. SS  Two weeks ago  Aimee was up for the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs. And she came into town and she rushed around and she said   I have to buy some new shoes   We're an hour before the ESPYs  and she thought she'd gotten a two inch heel but she'd actually bought a three inch heel. AM  And this poses a problem for me  because it means I'm walking like that all night long. SS  For    minutes. Luckily  the hotel was terrific. They got someone to come in and saw off the shoes. AM  I said to the receptionist    I mean  I am just harried  and Sheryl's at my side    I said   Look  do you have anybody here who could help me  Because I have this problem ...   You know  at first they were just going to write me off  like   If you don't like your shoes  sorry. It's too late.   No  no  no  no. I've got these special feet that need a two inch heel. I have a three inch heel. I need a little bit off.  They didn't even want to go there. They didn't even want to touch that one. They just did it. No  these legs are great. I'm actually going back in a couple of weeks to get some improvements. I want to get legs like these made for flat feet so I can wear sneakers  because I can't with these ones. So... Moderator  That's it. SS  That's Aimee Mullins. How can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us  and aid medicine  How can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology into a simple  hand held  single diagnostic assay  I want to turn everything we know right now about detecting viruses and the spectrum of viruses that are out there into  let's say  a small chip. When we started thinking about this project    how we would make a single diagnostic assay to screen for all pathogens simultaneously    well  there's some problems with this idea. First of all  viruses are pretty complex  but they're also evolving very fast. This is a picornavirus. Picornaviruses    these are things that include the common cold and polio  things like this. You're looking at the outside shell of the virus  and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evolving very  very fast  and the blue parts are not evolving very fast. When people think about making pan viral detection reagents  usually it's the fast evolving problem that's an issue  because how can we detect things if they're always changing  But evolution is a balance  where you have fast change  you also have ultra conservation    things that almost never change. And so we looked into this a little more carefully  and I'm going to show you data now. This is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop. I took a bunch of these small picornaviruses  like the common cold  like polio and so on  and I just broke them down into small segments. And so took this first example  which is called coxsackievirus  and just break it into small windows. And I'm coloring these small windows blue if another virus shares an identical sequence in its genome to that virus. These sequences right up here    which don't even code for protein  by the way    are almost absolutely identical across all of these  so I could use this sequence as a marker to detect a wide spectrum of viruses  without having to make something individual. Now  over here there's great diversity  that's where things are evolving fast. Down here you can see slower evolution  less diversity. Now  by the time we get out here to  let's say  acute bee paralysis virus    probably a bad one to have if you're a bee     this virus shares almost no similarity to coxsackievirus  but I can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved among these viruses on the right hand of the screen are in identical regions right up here. And so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra conservation through evolution    how these viruses evolved    by just choosing DNA elements or RNA elements in these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents. OK  so that's what we did  but how are we going to do that  Well  for a long time  since I was in graduate school  I've been messing around making DNA chips    that is  printing DNA on glass. And that's what you see here  These little salt spots are just DNA tacked onto glass  and so I can put thousands of these on our glass chip and use them as a detection reagent. We took our chip over to Hewlett Packard and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots  and this is what you see  you can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here. So  what we're doing is just printing DNA on glass    little flat things    and these are going to be markers for pathogens. OK  I make little robots in lab to make these chips  and I'm really big on disseminating technology. If you've got enough money to buy just a Camry  you can build one of these too  and so we put a deep how to guide on the Web  totally free  with basically order off the shelf parts. You can build a DNA array machine in your garage. Here's the section on the all important emergency stop switch. Every important machine's got to have a big red button. But really  it's pretty robust. You can actually be making DNA chips in your garage and decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly. It's a lot of fun. And so what we did    and this is a really cool project    we just started by making a respiratory virus chip. I talked about that    you know  that situation where you go into the clinic and you don't get diagnosed  Well  we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses on one chip  and we threw in herpes virus for good measure    I mean  why not  The first thing you do as a scientist is  you make sure stuff works. And so what we did is  we take tissue culture cells and infect them with various viruses  and we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid  the genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells    mostly viral stuff    and stick it on the array to see where it sticks. Now  if the DNA sequences match  they'll stick together  and so we can look at spots. And if spots light up  we know there's a certain virus in there. That's what one of these chips really looks like  and these red spots are  in fact  signals coming from the virus. And each spot represents a different family of virus or species of virus. And so  that's a hard way to look at things  so I'm just going to encode things as a little barcode  grouped by family  so you can see the results in a very intuitive way. What we did is  we took tissue culture cells and infected them with adenovirus  and you can see this little yellow barcode next to adenovirus. And  likewise  we infected them with parainfluenza      that's a paramyxovirus    and you see a little barcode here. And then we did respiratory syncytial virus. That's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere    it's like boogeremia  basically. You can see that this barcode is the same family  but it's distinct from parainfluenza    which gives you a very bad cold. And so we're getting unique signatures  a fingerprint for each virus. Polio and rhino  they're in the same family  very close to each other. Rhino's the common cold  and you all know what polio is  and you can see that these signatures are distinct. And Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpes virus gives a nice signature down here. And so it is not any one stripe or something that tells me I have a virus of a particular type here  it's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing. All right  I can see a rhinovirus    and here's the blow up of the rhinovirus's little barcode    but what about different rhinoviruses  How do I know which rhinovirus I have  There're     known variants of the common cold  and there're only     because people got bored collecting them  there are just new ones every year. And so  here are four different rhinoviruses  and you can see  even with your eye  without any fancy computer pattern matching recognition software algorithms  that you can distinguish each one of these barcodes from each other. Now  this is kind of a cheap shot  because I know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is  and I in fact designed the chip expressly to be able to tell them apart  but what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer  We don't know what the sequence is  just pull them out of the field. So  here are four rhinoviruses we never knew anything about    no one's ever sequenced them    and you can also see that you get unique and distinguishable patterns. You can imagine building up some library  whether real or virtual  of fingerprints of essentially every virus. But that's  again  shooting fish in a barrel  you know  right  You have tissue culture cells. There are a ton of viruses. What about real people  You can't control real people  as you probably know. You have no idea what someone's going to cough into a cup  and it's probably really complex  right  It could have lots of bacteria  it could have more than one virus  and it certainly has host genetic material. So how do we deal with this  And how do we do the positive control here  Well  it's pretty simple. That's me  getting a nasal lavage. And the idea is  let's experimentally inoculate people with virus. This is all IRB approved  by the way  they got paid. And basically we experimentally inoculate people with the common cold virus. Or  even better  let's just take people right out of the emergency room    undefined  community acquired respiratory tract infections. You have no idea what walks in through the door. So  let's start off with the positive control first  where we know the person was healthy. They got a shot of virus up the nose  let's see what happens. Day zero  nothing happening. They're healthy  they're clean    it's amazing. Actually  we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses even when you're walking around healthy. It's pretty clean. If you're healthy  you're pretty healthy. Day two  we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern  and it's very similar to what we get in the lab doing our tissue culture experiment. So that's great  but again  cheap shot  right  We put a ton of virus up this guy's nose. So       I mean  we wanted it to work. He really had a cold. So  how about the people who walk in off the street  Here are two individuals represented by their anonymous ID codes. They both have rhinoviruses  we've never seen this pattern in lab. We sequenced part of their viruses  they're new rhinoviruses no one's actually even seen. Remember  our evolutionary conserved sequences we're using on this array allow us to detect even novel or uncharacterized viruses  because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution. Here's another guy. You can play the diagnosis game yourself here. These different blocks represent the different viruses in this paramyxovirus family  so you can kind of go down the blocks and see where the signal is. Well  doesn't have canine distemper  that's probably good. But by the time you get to block nine  you see that respiratory syncytial virus. Maybe they have kids. And then you can see  also  the family member that's related  RSVB is showing up here. So  that's great. Here's another individual  sampled on two separate days    repeat visits to the clinic. This individual has parainfluenza    and you can see that there's a little stripe over here for Sendai virus  that's mouse parainfluenza. The genetic relationships are very close there. That's a lot of fun. So  we built out the chip. We made a chip that has every known virus ever discovered on it. Why not  Every plant virus  every insect virus  every marine virus. Everything that we could get out of GenBank    that is  the national repository of sequences. Now we're using this chip. And what are we using it for  Well  first of all  when you have a big chip like this  you need a little bit more informatics  so we designed the system to do automatic diagnosis. And the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns  because we're never going to get samples of every virus    it would be virtually impossible. But we can get virtual patterns  and compare them to our observed result    which is a very complex mixture    and come up with some sort of score of how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something. And this is what this looks like. If  for example  you used a cell culture that's chronically infected with papilloma  you get a little computer readout here  and our algorithm says it's probably papilloma type   . And that is  in fact  what these particular cell cultures are chronically infected with. So let's do something a little bit harder. We put the beeper in the clinic. When somebody shows up  and the hospital doesn't know what to do because they can't diagnose it  they call us. That's the idea  and we're setting this up in the Bay Area. And so  this case report happened three weeks ago. We have a    year old healthy woman  no travel history   unclear   doesn't smoke  doesn't drink.    day history of fevers  night sweats  bloody sputum    she's coughing up blood    muscle pain. She went to the clinic  and they gave her antibiotics and then sent her home. She came back after ten days of fever  right  Still has the fever  and she's hypoxic    she doesn't have much oxygen in her lungs. They did a CT scan. A normal lung is all sort of dark and black here. All this white stuff    it's not good. This sort of tree and bud formation indicates there's inflammation  there's likely to be infection. OK. So  the patient was treated then with a third generation cephalosporin antibiotic and doxycycline  and on day three  it didn't help  she had progressed to acute failure. They had to intubate her  so they put a tube down her throat and they began to mechanically ventilate her. She could no longer breathe for herself. What to do next  Don't know. Switch antibiotics  so they switched to another antibiotic  Tamiflu. It's not clear why they thought she had the flu  but they switched to Tamiflu. And on day six  they basically threw in the towel. You do an open lung biopsy when you've got no other options. There's an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this procedure  and so basically    and what do they learn from it  You're looking at her open lung biopsy. And I'm no pathologist  but you can't tell much from this. All you can tell is  there's a lot of swelling  bronchiolitis. It was  unrevealing   that's the pathologist's report. And so  what did they test her for  They have their own tests  of course  and so they tested her for over    different assays  for every sort of bacteria and fungus and viral assay you can buy off the shelf  SARS  metapneumovirus  HIV  RSV    all these. Everything came back negative  over         dollars worth of tests. I mean  they went to the max for this woman. And basically on hospital day eight  that's when they called us. They gave us endotracheal aspirate    you know  a little fluid from the throat  from this tube that they got down there    and they gave us this. We put it on the chip  what do we see  Well  we saw parainfluenza  . Well  what the hell's parainfluenza    No one tests for parainfluenza  . No one cares about it. In fact  it's not even really sequenced that much. There's just a little bit of it sequenced. There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it. No one would even consider it  because no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure. And why is that  Just lore. There's no data    no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease. Clearly  we have a case of a healthy person that's going down. OK  that's one case report. I'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes that's unpublished    it's going to come out tomorrow    and it's an interesting case of how you might use this chip to find something new and open a new door. Prostate cancer. I don't need to give you many statistics about prostate cancer. Most of you already know it  third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. Lots of risk factors  but there is a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer. For maybe about    percent of prostate cancer  there are folks that are predisposed to it. And the first gene that was mapped in association studies for this  early onset prostate cancer  was this gene called RNASEL. What is that  It's an antiviral defense enzyme. So  we're sitting around and thinking   Why would men who have the mutation    a defect in an antiviral defense system    get prostate cancer  It doesn't make sense    unless  maybe  there's a virus   So  we put tumors     and now we have over     tumors    on our array. And we know who's got defects in RNASEL and who doesn't. And I'm showing you the signal from the chip here  and I'm showing you for the block of retroviral oligos. And what I'm telling you here from the signal  is that men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme  and have a tumor  often have       percent of the time    a signature which reveals a new retrovirus. OK  that's pretty wild. What is it  So  we clone the whole virus. First of all  I'll tell you that a little automated prediction told us it was very similar to a mouse virus. But that doesn't tell us too much  so we actually clone the whole thing. And the viral genome I'm showing you right here  It's a classic gamma retrovirus  but it's totally new  no one's ever seen it before. Its closest relative is  in fact  from mice  and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus  because it's infecting a species other than mice. And this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it's related to other viruses. We've done it for many patients now  and we can say that they're all independent infections. They all have the same virus  but they're different enough that there's reason to believe that they've been independently acquired. Is it really in the tissue  And I'll end up with this  yes. We take slices of these biopsies of tumor tissue and use material to actually locate the virus  and we find cells here with viral particles in them. These guys really do have this virus. Does this virus cause prostate cancer  Nothing I'm saying here implies causality. I don't know. Is it a link to oncogenesis  I don't know. Is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses  Could be. And it might have nothing to do with cancer. But now it's a door. We have a strong association between the presence of this virus and a genetic mutation that's been linked to cancer. That's where we're at. So  it opens up more questions than it answers  I'm afraid  but that's what  you know  science is really good at. This was all done by folks in the lab    I cannot take credit for most of this. This is a collaboration between myself and Don. This is the guy who started the project in my lab  and this is the guy who's been doing prostate stuff. Thank you very much.  Applause  Natalie MacMaster  I'm going to just quickly start out with a little bit of music here.  Applause  Thank you   Applause  I took my shoes off to dance  but maybe I'll get at that later. Anyways  I... where to start  Well  I'm really excited to talk a bit about my own upbringing in music and family and all of that  but I'm even more excited for you people to hear about Donnell's amazing family and maybe even a little bit about how we met  and all that sort of thing  but for those of you that may not be familiar with my upbringing  I'm from Cape Breton Island  Nova Scotia  eastern Canada  which is a very  very musical island  and its origins come from Scotland with the music and all the traditions  the dancing  the language  which unfortunately is dying out in Cape Breton. The traditional language is Gaelic  but a lot of the music came from the Gaelic language  and the dancing and the singing and everything  and my bloodline is Scottish through and through  but my mother and father are two very  very musical people. My mom taught me to dance when I was five  and my dad taught me to play fiddle when I was nine. My uncle is a very well known Cape Breton fiddler. His name's Buddy MacMaster  and just a wonderful guy  and we have a great tradition at home called square dancing  and we had parties  great parties at our house and the neighbors' houses  and you talk about kitchen c ilidhs. Well  c ilidh first of all is Gaelic for party  but kitchen party in Cape Breton is very common  and basically somebody drops into the house  and no matter what house you go to in Cape Breton  there's a fiddle there  guaranteed  and I'd say  well there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere in the world  so ten chances to one  the fellow who walked in the door could play it  so you'd have someone come into the house  you'd invite them to play a tune  and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance  and somebody would sing  and all that sort of thing  so it was a wonderful  wonderful way to grow up  and that is where my beginnings in music come from  my surroundings  my family  just my bloodline in itself  and  oh  I've done lots of things with my music. I've recorded lots of CDs. I was nominated for a Grammy and I've won some awards and stuff like that  so that's awesome  but the best part was meeting my husband  and I've actually known Donnell for probably    years now  and I'm going to get into a little bit of  I guess  how music brought us together  but I'm going to introduce you right now to my new husband as of October    Donnell Leahy.  Applause  Donnell Leahy  Thank you. I'm kind of new to the TED experience and I'm glad to be here  but I'm just trying to put it all together  trying to figure all you people out  and I've been here for a short while  and I'm starting to understand a little bit better. So I asked Natalie  what do I do  And she said  just talk about yourself. It's kind of boring  but I'll just tell you a little bit about my family. I'm one of    brothers and sisters from Lakefield  Ontario  an hour and a half northeast of Toronto  and we grew up on a farm. Mom and Dad raised beef cattle  and I'm the oldest boy. There are four girls a little bit older than me. We grew up without a television. People find that strange  but I think it was a great blessing for us. We had a television for a few years  but of course we wasted so much time and the work wasn't getting done  so out went the television. We grew up playing  Mom's from Cape Breton  coincidentally. Mom and Natalie's mother knew each other. We grew up playing  and used to dance together  right  yeah. we played by ear and I think that's important for us because we were not really exposed to a lot of different styles of music. We learned to play the instruments  but we kind of had to come from within or go from within  because we didn't watch television  we didn't listen to a lot of radio. We went to church and to school sometimes  and farmed and played music  so we were able  I think  at a very critical age to develop our own style  our own self  and my mother plays  my father plays  and the style that came from the Ottawa Valley in Ontario  we call it French Canadian style but it originated in logging camps. Years ago  hundreds of men would go up for the winter to the camps in Northern Ontario and in Quebec  and they were all different cultures  and the Irish  the French  Scottish  German  they'd all meet  and of course at night  they'd play cards and step dance and play fiddles  and over the course of many years  the Ottawa Valley fiddling kind of evolved and the Ottawa Valley step dancing evolved  so that's  I kind of started out with that style and I quickly started doing my own thing  and then I met Natalie  and I was exposed to the great Cape Breton fiddling. That's how we met.  Laughter  You tell them.  Laughter  NM  You want to or no   Laughter  Well I guess I have to now. Well  it's just so interesting that Donnell's upbringing was very similar to mine  and I actually saw Donnell play when I was about    years old  and he and his family came to Inverness  which is about    minutes from where I lived  and I was just blown away  like  it was just amazing  and you'll find out why pretty soon here  but I couldn't believe the fiddling and Mom was there with me  and she was saying   Donnell's mother came up on stage and danced with her children  and Mom was saying   That's Julie MacDonnell  I used to dance with her when we were kids. Little did I think our children would be playing instruments  you know  playing music  yeah.  Twelve years  er     years later little did she think her kids would be getting married  but anyway  so  then I got a phone call about  I dunno  seven years later. I was     first or second year of college  and it was Donnell  and he said  Hi  you probably don't know me but my name is Donnell Leahy.  And I said   I know you. I have a tape of yours at home.  And he said   Well  I'm in Truro   which is where I was  and he asked me out for supper. That's it.  Laughter  Then   Will I keep going   Laughs  Then we dated for two years  broke up for     got back together and got married.  Laughter   Applause  DL  So anyway  we're running out of time  so I'll just get to it. I'm going to play a piece of music for you. It's actually a Scottish piece I've chosen. I starts out with a slow air. Airs were played in Europe at burials  as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site  the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player. I'll quickly play a short part of the air  and then I'm going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you're not warmed up  so  if I mess it up  pretend you like it anyway. It's called The Banks. NM  Well  we're gonna play one together now.  Applause  We're laughing  like  because our styles are totally different  as you can hear. And so  you know  Donnell and I are actually in the process of writing new pieces of music together that we can play  but we don't have any of those ready. We just started yesterday.  Laughter  So we're gonna play something together anyway. DL  With one minute. NM  With one minute. DL  You start. NM  No  you have to start  because you've got to do your thing. NM  I'm not tuned. Hold on. NM  I feel like I'm in the duck or the bird pose right now.  Laughter  Announcer  Great news  they're running late downstairs. We've got another    minutes. NM  Okay. Sure. All right  okay. Let's get her going.  Applause  DL  What do you want to play  NM  Well  um... NM  Uh  sure. DL  How fast  NM  Not too fast. DL  We're going to play a tune and Natalie's going to accompany me on the piano. The Cape Breton piano playing is just awesome. It's very rhythmic and  you'll see it. My mom plays piano  and she learned to play before they had a piano at home in Cape Breton. Before Mom's family had a piano in Cape Breton  she learned to play the rhythms on a piece of board  and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter's evenings and Mom would be banging on this board  so when they bought a piano  they bought it in Toronto and had it taken by train and brought in on a horse  a horse and sleigh to the house. It became the only piano in the region  and Mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived  she could play it because she had learned all these rhythms. Anyway  we found the piano last year and were able to bring it back home. We purchased it. It had gone through  like  five or six families  and it was just a big thing for us  and we found actually an old picture of somebody and their family years ago. Anyway  I'm blabbering on here. NM  No  I want you to tell them about Leahy. DL  What about Leahy   Laughter  NM  Just tell them what  DL  She wants me to talk about  We have a band named Leahy. There's    siblings. We  um  What will I tell them   Laughter  We opened  NM  No surgeries. DL  No surgeries  oh yeah. We had a great opportunity. We opened for Shania Twain for two years on her international tour. It was a big thing for us  and now all my sisters are off having babies and the boys are all getting married  so we're staying close to home for  I guess  another couple of weeks. What can I say  I don't know what to say  Natalie. We  uh...  Laughter  NM  Is this what marriage is about  I like it.  Applause  DL  Oh yeah  okay  in my family we had seven girls  four boys  we had two fiddles and one piano  and of course we were all fighting to play on the instruments  so dad and mom set a rule that you couldn't kick anyone off the instrument. You had to wait until they were finished  so of course  what we would do is we'd get on the piano and you wouldn't even get off to eat  because you wouldn't want to give it up to your brother or sister  and they'd wait and wait and wait  and it'd be midnight and you'd be still sitting there on the piano  but it was their way to get us to practice. Will we play a tune  NM  It worked. DL  It worked. Sorry  I hate to carry on... So this is our last number  and we'll feature Nat on piano. Okay  play in  how about A
