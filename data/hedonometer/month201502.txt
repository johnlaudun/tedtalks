So recently  we heard a lot about how social media helps empower protest  and that's true  but after more than a decade of studying and participating in multiple social movements  I've come to realize that the way technology empowers social movements can also paradoxically help weaken them. This is not inevitable  but overcoming it requires diving deep into what makes success possible over the long term. And the lessons apply in multiple domains. Now  take Turkey's Gezi Park protests  July       which I went back to study in the field. Twitter was key to its organizing. It was everywhere in the park    well  along with a lot of tear gas. It wasn't all high tech. But the people in Turkey had already gotten used to the power of Twitter because of an unfortunate incident about a year before when military jets had bombed and killed    Kurdish smugglers near the border region  and Turkish media completely censored this news. Editors sat in their newsrooms and waited for the government to tell them what to do. One frustrated journalist could not take this anymore. He purchased his own plane ticket  and went to the village where this had occurred. And he was confronted by this scene  a line of coffins coming down a hill  relatives wailing. He later he told me how overwhelmed he felt  and didn't know what to do  so he took out his phone  like any one of us might  and snapped that picture and tweeted it out. And voila  that picture went viral and broke the censorship and forced mass media to cover it. So when  a year later  Turkey's Gezi protests happened  it started as a protest about a park being razed  but became an anti authoritarian protest. It wasn't surprising that media also censored it  but it got a little ridiculous at times. When things were so intense  when CNN International was broadcasting live from Istanbul  CNN Turkey instead was broadcasting a documentary on penguins. Now  I love penguin documentaries  but that wasn't the news of the day. An angry viewer put his two screens together and snapped that picture  and that one too went viral  and since then  people call Turkish media the penguin media.  Laughter  But this time  people knew what to do. They just took out their phones and looked for actual news. Better  they knew to go to the park and take pictures and participate and share it more on social media. Digital connectivity was used for everything from food to donations. Everything was organized partially with the help of these new technologies. And using Internet to mobilize and publicize protests actually goes back a long way. Remember the Zapatistas  the peasant uprising in the southern Chiapas region of Mexico led by the masked  pipe smoking  charismatic Subcomandante Marcos  That was probably the first movement that got global attention thanks to the Internet. Or consider Seattle '    when a multinational grassroots effort brought global attention to what was then an obscure organization  the World Trade Organization  by also utilizing these digital technologies to help them organize. And more recently  movement after movement has shaken country after country  the Arab uprisings from Bahrain to Tunisia to Egypt and more  indignados in Spain  Italy  Greece  the Gezi Park protests  Taiwan  Euromaidan in Ukraine  Hong Kong. And think of more recent initiatives  like the  BringBackOurGirls hashtags. Nowadays  a network of tweets can unleash a global awareness campaign. A Facebook page can become the hub of a massive mobilization. Amazing. But think of the moments I just mentioned. The achievements they were able to have  their outcomes  are not really proportional to the size and energy they inspired. The hopes they rightfully raised are not really matched by what they were able to have as a result in the end. And this raises a question  As digital technology makes things easier for movements  why haven't successful outcomes become more likely as well  In embracing digital platforms for activism and politics  are we overlooking some of the benefits of doing things the hard way  Now  I believe so. I believe that the rule of thumb is  Easier to mobilize does not always mean easier to achieve gains. Now  to be clear  technology does empower in multiple ways. It's very powerful. In Turkey  I watched four young college students organize a countrywide citizen journalism network called    Journos that became the central hub for uncensored news in the country. In Egypt  I saw another four young people use digital connectivity to organize the supplies and logistics for    field hospitals  very large operations  during massive clashes near Tahrir Square in     . And I asked the founder of this effort  called Tahrir Supplies  how long it took him to go from when he had the idea to when he got started.  Five minutes   he said. Five minutes. And he had no training or background in logistics. Or think of the Occupy movement which rocked the world in     . It started with a single email from a magazine  Adbusters  to        subscribers in its list. About two months after that first email  there were in the United States     ongoing occupations and protests. Less than one month after the first physical occupation in Zuccotti Park  a global protest was held in about    countries      cities. It was one of the largest global protests ever organized. Now  compare that to what the Civil Rights Movement had to do in      Alabama to protest the racially segregated bus system  which they wanted to boycott. They'd been preparing for many years and decided it was time to swing into action after Rosa Parks was arrested. But how do you get the word out    tomorrow we're going to start the boycott    when you don't have Facebook  texting  Twitter  none of that  So they had to mimeograph        leaflets by sneaking into a university duplicating room and working all night  secretly. They then used the    African American organizations that criss crossed the city to distribute those leaflets by hand. And the logistical tasks were daunting  because these were poor people. They had to get to work  boycott or no  so a massive carpool was organized  again by meeting. No texting  no Twitter  no Facebook. They had to meet almost all the time to keep this carpool going. Today  it would be so much easier. We could create a database  available rides and what rides you need  have the database coordinate  and use texting. We wouldn't have to meet all that much. But again  consider this  the Civil Rights Movement in the United States navigated a minefield of political dangers  faced repression and overcame  won major policy concessions  navigated and innovated through risks. In contrast  three years after Occupy sparked that global conversation about inequality  the policies that fueled it are still in place. Europe was also rocked by anti austerity protests  but the continent didn't shift its direction. In embracing these technologies  are we overlooking some of the benefits of slow and sustained  To understand this  I went back to Turkey about a year after the Gezi protests and I interviewed a range of people  from activists to politicians  from both the ruling party and the opposition party and movements. I found that the Gezi protesters were despairing. They were frustrated  and they had achieved much less than what they had hoped for. This echoed what I'd been hearing around the world from many other protesters that I'm in touch with. And I've come to realize that part of the problem is that today's protests have become a bit like climbing Mt. Everest with the help of    Sherpas  and the Internet is our Sherpa. What we're doing is taking the fast routes and not replacing the benefits of the slower work. Because  you see  the kind of work that went into organizing all those daunting  tedious logistical tasks did not just take care of those tasks  they also created the kind of organization that could think together collectively and make hard decisions together  create consensus and innovate  and maybe even more crucially  keep going together through differences. So when you see this March on Washington in       when you look at that picture  where this is the march where Martin Luther King gave his famous  I have a dream  speech        you don't just see a march and you don't just hear a powerful speech  you also see the painstaking  long term work that can put on that march. And if you're in power  you realize you have to take the capacity signaled by that march  not just the march  but the capacity signaled by that march  seriously. In contrast  when you look at Occupy's global marches that were organized in two weeks  you see a lot of discontent  but you don't necessarily see teeth that can bite over the long term. And crucially  the Civil Rights Movement innovated tactically from boycotts to lunch counter sit ins to pickets to marches to freedom rides. Today's movements scale up very quickly without the organizational base that can see them through the challenges. They feel a little like startups that got very big without knowing what to do next  and they rarely manage to shift tactically because they don't have the depth of capacity to weather such transitions. Now  I want to be clear  The magic is not in the mimeograph. It's in that capacity to work together  think together collectively  which can only be built over time with a lot of work. To understand all this  I interviewed a top official from the ruling party in Turkey  and I ask him   How do you do it   They too use digital technology extensively  so that's not it. So what's the secret  Well  he told me. He said the key is he never took sugar with his tea. I said  what has that got to do with anything  Well  he said  his party starts getting ready for the next election the day after the last one  and he spends all day every day meeting with voters in their homes  in their wedding parties  circumcision ceremonies  and then he meets with his colleagues to compare notes. With that many meetings every day  with tea offered at every one of them  which he could not refuse  because that would be rude  he could not take even one cube of sugar per cup of tea  because that would be many kilos of sugar  he can't even calculate how many kilos  and at that point I realized why he was speaking so fast. We had met in the afternoon  and he was already way over caffeinated. But his party won two major elections within a year of the Gezi protests with comfortable margins. To be sure  governments have different resources to bring to the table. It's not the same game  but the differences are instructive. And like all such stories  this is not a story just of technology. It's what technology allows us to do converging with what we want to do. Today's social movements want to operate informally. They do not want institutional leadership. They want to stay out of politics because they fear corruption and cooptation. They have a point. Modern representative democracies are being strangled in many countries by powerful interests. But operating this way makes it hard for them to sustain over the long term and exert leverage over the system  which leads to frustrated protesters dropping out  and even more corrupt politics. And politics and democracy without an effective challenge hobbles  because the causes that have inspired the modern recent movements are crucial. Climate change is barreling towards us. Inequality is stifling human growth and potential and economies. Authoritarianism is choking many countries. We need movements to be more effective. Now  some people have argued that the problem is today's movements are not formed of people who take as many risks as before  and that is not true. From Gezi to Tahrir to elsewhere  I've seen people put their lives and livelihoods on the line. It's also not true  as Malcolm Gladwell claimed  that today's protesters form weaker virtual ties. No  they come to these protests  just like before  with their friends  existing networks  and sometimes they do make new friends for life. I still see the friends that I made in those Zapatista convened global protests more than a decade ago  and the bonds between strangers are not worthless. When I got tear gassed in Gezi  people I didn't know helped me and one another instead of running away. In Tahrir  I saw people  protesters  working really hard to keep each other safe and protected. And digital awareness raising is great  because changing minds is the bedrock of changing politics. But movements today have to move beyond participation at great scale very fast and figure out how to think together collectively  develop strong policy proposals  create consensus  figure out the political steps and relate them to leverage  because all these good intentions and bravery and sacrifice by itself are not going to be enough. And there are many efforts. In New Zealand  a group of young people are developing a platform called Loomio for participatory decision making at scale. In Turkey     Journos are holding hack a thons so that they support communities as well as citizen journalism. In Argentina  an open source platform called DemocracyOS is bringing participation to parliaments and political parties. These are all great  and we need more  but the answer won't just be better online decision making  because to update democracy  we are going to need to innovate at every level  from the organizational to the political to the social. Because to succeed over the long term  sometimes you do need tea without sugar along with your Twitter. Thank you. When I was invited to give this talk  a couple of months ago  we discussed a number  of titles with the organizers  and a lot of different items were  kicked around and were discussed. But nobody suggested this one  and the reason for that was two months ago  Ebola was escalating exponentially and spreading over wider geographic areas than we had ever seen  and the world was terrified   concerned and alarmed by this disease  in a way we've not  seen in recent history. But today  I can stand here  and I can talk to you about beating Ebola because of people  whom you've never heard of  people like Peter Clement  a Liberian  doctor who's working in Lofa County  a place that many of you have  never heard of  probably  in Liberia. The reason that Lofa County  is so important is because about five months ago  when the epidemic was  just starting to escalate  Lofa County was right at the center   the epicenter of this epidemic. At that time  MSF and the treatment center there  they were seeing dozens of patients  every single day  and these patients  these communities were becoming more and more terrified as time went by  with this disease  and what it was doing to their families  to their communities   to their children  to their relatives. And so Peter Clement was charged with  driving that    hour long rough road from Monrovia  the capital  up to Lofa County  to try and help bring control to the escalating epidemic there. And what Peter found when he arrived was the terror that I just mentioned to you. So he sat down with the local chiefs   and he listened. And what he heard was heartbreaking. He heard about the devastation  and the desperation of people affected by this disease. He heard the heartbreaking stories about not just the damage that Ebola did to people  but what it did to families  and what it did to communities. And he listened to the local chiefs there and what they told him    They said   When our children are sick   when our children are dying  we can't hold them at a time when  we want to be closest to them. When our relatives die  we can't take care of them as our tradition demands. We are not allowed to wash  the bodies to bury them the way our communities and  our rituals demand. And for this reason  they were deeply disturbed  deeply alarmed and the entire epidemic  was unraveling in front of them. People were turning on the healthcare  workers who had come  the heroes who had come to try  and help save the community  to help work with the community  and they were unable to access them. And what happened then was  Peter explained to the leaders. The leaders listened.  They turned the tables. And Peter explained what Ebola was. He explained what the disease was. He explained what it did to their communities. And he explained that Ebola threatened  everything that made us human. Ebola means you can't hold your children the way you would in this situation. You can't bury your dead  the way that you would. You have to trust these people  in these space suits to do that for you. And ladies and gentlemen  what  happened then was rather extraordinary  The community and the health workers   Peter  they sat down together and they put together a new plan  for controlling Ebola in Lofa County. And the reason that this is such  an important story  ladies and gentlemen  is because today  this county  which is  right at the center of this epidemic you've been watching   you've been seeing in the newspapers  you've been seeing on  the television screens  today Lofa County is nearly eight weeks without seeing a single case of Ebola. Now  this doesn't mean that  the job is done  obviously. There's still a huge risk that there will be additional cases there. But what it does teach us  is that Ebola can be beaten. That's the key thing. Even on this scale  even with the rapid kind of growth that we saw in this environment here  we now know Ebola can be beaten. When communities come together  with health care workers  work together  that's when this disease can be stopped. But how did Ebola end up in Lofa County in the first place  Well  for that  we have to go back     months  to the start of this epidemic. And as many of you know   this virus went undetected  it evaded detection for three  or four months when it began. That's because this is not  a disease of West Africa  it's a disease of Central Africa   half a continent away. People hadn't seen the disease before  health workers hadn't seen  the disease before. They didn't know what  they were dealing with  and to make it  even more complicated  the virus itself was causing a symptom  a type of a presentation that wasn't classical of the disease. So people didn't even recognize  the disease  people who knew Ebola. For that reason it evaded detection  for some time  But contrary to public belief  sometimes these days  once the virus was detected   there was a rapid surge in of support. MSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment  center  as many of you know  in the area. The World Health Organization and the partners that it works with deployed eventually hundreds of people  over the next two months to be able to help track the virus. The problem  ladies and gentlemen  is by then  this virus  well known now as Ebola   had spread too far. It had already outstripped what was  one of the largest responses that had been mounted so far to an Ebola outbreak. By the middle of the year  not just Guinea but now Sierra Leone and Liberia were also infected. As the virus was spreading geographically  the numbers were increasing and at this time  not only were  hundreds of people infected and dying of the disease  but as importantly  the front line responders  the people who had gone to try and help  the health care workers  the other  responders were also sick and dying by the dozens. The presidents of these countries  recognized the emergencies. They met right around that time   they agreed on common action and they put together an emergency  joint operation center in Conakry to try and work together to finish this disease and get it stopped  to implement the strategies we talked about. But what happened then was something  we had never seen before with Ebola. What happened then was the virus   or someone sick with the virus  boarded an airplane   flew to another country  and for the first time  we saw in another distant country the virus pop up again. This time it was in Nigeria  in the teeming metropolis of Lagos     million people. Now the virus was in that environment. And as you can anticipate   there was international alarm  international concern on a scale that  we hadn't seen in recent years caused by a disease like this. The World Health Organization immediately  called together an expert panel  looked at the situation   declared an international emergency. And in doing so  the expectation would be that there would be a huge outpouring of international assistance to help these countries which were in so much trouble and concern at that time. But what we saw was  something very different. There was some great response. A number of countries came to assist    many  many NGOs and others  as you know  but at the same time  the opposite  happened in many places. Alarm escalated  and very soon  these countries found themselves not receiving the support they needed  but increasingly isolated. What we saw was commercial airlines  stopped  flying into these countries and people who hadn't even been exposed to the virus were no longer allowed to travel. This caused not only problems  obviously   for the countries themselves  but also for the response. Those organizations that were  trying to bring people in  to try and help them respond to the outbreak  they could not get  people on airplanes  they could not get them into the  countries to be able to respond. In that situation  ladies and gentleman  a virus like Ebola takes advantage. And what we saw then was something  also we hadn't seen before. Not only did this virus  continue in the places where they'd already become infected  but then it started to escalate and we saw the case numbers that you see here  something we'd never seen before on such a scale  an exponential increase of Ebola cases not just in these countries or the areas  already infected in these countries but also spreading further and  deeper into these countries. Ladies and gentleman  this was one of the most concerning international emergencies in public health we've ever seen. And what happened in these countries then  many of you saw  again  on the television  read about in the newspapers  we saw the health system start to collapse under the weight of this epidemic. We saw the schools begin to close   markets no longer started  no longer functioned the way  that they should in these countries. We saw that misinformation and  misperceptions started to spread even faster through the communities  which became even more alarmed about the situation. They started to recoil from those people  that you saw in those space suits  as they call them   who had come to help them. And then the situation deteriorated even further. The countries had to declare a state of emergency. Large populations needed to be quarantined in some areas  and then riots broke out. It was a very  very terrifying situation. Around the world  many people began to ask  can we ever stop Ebola  when it starts to spread like this  And they started to ask  how well  do we really know this virus  The reality is we don't know  Ebola extremely well. It's a relatively modern disease in terms of what we know about it. We've known the disease only for    years  since it first popped up in Central Africa in     . But despite that  we do know many things  We know that this virus probably survives in a type of a bat. We know that it probably enters  a human population when we come in contact with a wild animal that has been infected with the virus  and probably sickened by it. Then we know that the virus spreads from person to person through contaminated body fluids. And as you've all seen  we know the horrific disease that it then causes in humans  where we see this disease cause severe fevers  diarrhea  vomiting  and then unfortunately  in    percent of the cases or often more  death. This is a very dangerous  debilitating  and deadly disease. But despite the fact that we've not known this disease for a particularly long time  and we don't know everything about it  we do know how to stop this disease. There are four things that are critical to stopping Ebola. First and foremost  the communities  have got to understand this disease  they've got to understand  how it spreads and how to stop it. And then we've got to be able to have  systems that can find every single case  every contact of those cases  and begin to track the transmission chains so that you can stop transmission. We have to have treatment centers  specialized Ebola treatment centers  where the workers can be protected as they try to provide support to the people who are infected  so that they might survive the disease. And then for those who do die  we have to ensure there is a safe  but at the same time dignified  burial process  so that there is no spread  at that time as well. So we do know how to stop Ebola  and these strategies work  ladies and gentlemen. The virus was stopped in Nigeria  by these four strategies and the people implementing  them  obviously. It was stopped in Senegal  where it had spread  and also in the other countries that were affected by this virus   in this outbreak. So there's no question that  these strategies actually work. The big question  ladies and gentlemen  was whether these strategies could work on this scale  in this situation  with so many countries affected with the kind of exponential  growth that you saw. That was the big question that we were  facing just two or three months ago. Today we know the answer to that question. And we know that answer  because of the extraordinary work of an incredible group of NGOs  of governments  of local leaders  of U.N. agencies and many humanitarian  and other organizations that came and joined the fight to try and stop Ebola in West Africa. But what had to be done there  was slightly different. These countries took those strategies  I just showed you  the community engagement  the case finding  contact tracing  etc.  and they turned them on their head. There was so much disease  they approached it differently. What they decided to do was they would  first try and slow down this epidemic by rapidly building as many beds as possible in specialized treatment centers so that they could prevent the disease from spreading from those were infected. They would rapidly build out many  many burial teams so that they could safely deal with the dead  and with that  they would try  and slow this outbreak to see if it could actually then  be controlled using the classic approach of case finding and contact tracing. And when I went to West Africa about three months ago  when I was there what I saw was extraordinary. I saw presidents opening emergency operation centers themselves against Ebola so that they could personally coordinate  and oversee and champion this surge of international support  to try and stop this disease. We saw militaries from within  those countries and from far beyond coming in to help build  Ebola treatment centers that could be used to isolate  those who were sick. We saw the Red Cross movement working with its partner agencies on the ground there to help train the communities so that they could actually safely bury their dead in a dignified manner themselves. And we saw the U.N. agencies   the World Food Program  build a tremendous air bridge that could get responders to every single corner of these countries rapidly to be able to implement the strategies that we just talked about. What we saw  ladies and gentlemen   which was probably most impressive  was this incredible work by the governments  by the leaders in these countries  with the communities  to try to ensure people  understood this disease  understood the extraordinary things they  would have to do to try and stop Ebola. And as a result  ladies and gentlemen  we saw something that we did not know only two or three months earlier  whether or not it would be possible. What we saw was  what you see now in this graph  when we took stock on December  . What we saw was we could  bend that curve  so to speak  change this exponential growth  and bring some hope back to the ability to control this outbreak. And for this reason  ladies and gentlemen  there's absolutely no question now that we can catch up with this outbreak  in West Africa and we can beat Ebola. The big question  though   that many people are asking  even when they saw this curve  they said   Well  hang on a minute    that's great you can slow it down  but can you actually drive it down to zero   We already answered that question  back at the beginning of this talk  when I spoke about Lofa County in Liberia. We told you the story how Lofa County got to a situation where they have not seen Ebola for eight weeks. But there are similar stories from  the other countries as well. From Gueckedou in Guinea  the first area where the first case was actually diagnosed. We've seen very  very few cases in the last couple of months  and here in Kenema  in Sierra Leone   another area in the epicenter  we have not seen the virus for more than a couple of weeks    way too early to declare  victory  obviously  but evidence  ladies and gentlemen  not only can the response  catch up to the disease  but this disease can be driven to zero. The challenge now  of course   is doing this on the scale needed right across these three countries  and that is a huge challenge. Because when you've been at something for this long  on this scale  two other big threats  come in to join the virus. The first of those is complacency  the risk that as this  disease curve starts to bend  the media look elsewhere   the world looks elsewhere. Complacency always a risk. And the other risk  of course  is when you've been working so hard for so long  and slept so few hours  over the past months  people are tired  people become fatigued  and these new risks  start to creep into the response. Ladies and gentlemen  I can tell you today I've just come back from West Africa. The people of these countries  the leaders of these countries  they are not complacent. They want to drive Ebola to zero  in their countries. And these people  yes  they're tired   but they are not fatigued. They have an energy  they have a courage  they have the strength  to get this finished. What they need  ladies and gentlemen  at this point  is the unwavering support of the  international community  to stand with them  to bolster and bring even more support  at this time  to get the job finished. Because finishing Ebola right now  means turning the tables on this virus  and beginning to hunt it. Remember  this virus  this whole crisis   rather  started with one case  and is going to finish with one case. But it will only finish if those countries have got enough epidemiologists  enough health workers  enough logisticians and enough other people working with them to be able to find every one  of those cases  track their contacts and make sure that this disease  stops once and for all. Ladies and gentleman  Ebola can be beaten. Now we need you to take this story out to tell it to the people who will listen and educate them  on what it means to beat Ebola  and more importantly  we need you to advocate with the people who can help us bring the resources we need to these countries  to beat this disease. There are a lot of people out there  who will survive and will thrive  in part because of what you do  to help us beat Ebola. Thank you. You've heard of your I.Q.  your general intelligence  but what's your Psy Q  How much do you know about what makes you tick  and how good are you at predicting other people's behavior or even your own  And how much of what you think you know about psychology is wrong  Let's find out by counting down the top    myths of psychology. You've probably heard it said that when it comes to their psychology  it's almost as if men are from Mars and women are from Venus. But how different are men and women really  To find out  let's start by looking at something on which men and women really do differ and plotting some psychological gender differences on the same scale. One thing men and women do really differ on is how far they can throw a ball. So if we look at the data for men here  we see what is called a normal distribution curve. A few men can throw a ball really far  and a few men not far at all  but most a kind of average distance. And women share the same distribution as well  but actually there's quite a big difference. In fact  the average man can throw a ball further than about    percent of all women. So now let's look at what some psychological gender differences look like on the same standardized scale. Any psychologist will tell you that men are better at spatial awareness than women    so things like map reading   for example    and it's true  but let's have a look at the size of this difference. It's tiny  the lines are so close together they almost overlap. In fact  the average woman is better than    percent of all men  and of course  if that was    percent  then the two genders would be exactly equal. It's worth bearing in mind that this difference and the next one I'll show you are pretty much the biggest psychological gender differences ever discovered in psychology. So here's the next one. Any psychologist will tell you that women are better with language and grammar than men. So here's performance on the standardized grammar test. There go the women. There go the men. Again  yes  women are better on average  but the lines are so close that    percent of men are better than the average woman  and again  if it was    percent  that would represent complete gender equality. So it's not really a case of Mars and Venus. It's more a case of  if anything  Mars and Snickers  basically the same  but one's maybe  slightly nuttier than the other. I won't say which. Now we've got you warmed up. Let's psychoanalyze you using the famous Rorschach inkblot test. So you can probably see two  I dunno  two bears or two people or something. But what do you think they're doing  Put your hand up if you think they're saying hello. Not many people. Okay. Put your hands up if you think they are high fiving. Okay. What if you think they're fighting  Only a few people there. Okay  so if you think they're saying hello or high fiving  then that means you're a friendly person. If you think they're fighting  you're a bit more of a  nasty  aggressive person. Are you a lover or a fighter  basically. What about this one  This isn't really a voting one  so on  three everyone shout out what you see. One  two  three.  Audience shouting  I heard hamster. Who said hamster  That was very worrying. A guy there said hamster. Well  you should see some kind of two legged animal here  and then the mirror image of them there. If you didn't  then this means that you have difficulty processing complex situations where there's a lot going on. Except  of course  it doesn't mean that at all. Rorschach inkblot tests have basically no validity when it comes to diagnosing people's personality and are not used by modern day psychologists. In fact  one recent study found that when you do try to diagnose people's personalities using Rorschach inkblot tests  schizophrenia was diagnosed in about one sixth of apparently perfectly normal participants. So if you didn't do that well on this  maybe you are not a very visual type of person. So let's do another quick quiz to find out. When making a cake  do you prefer to    so hands up for each one again    do you prefer to use a recipe book with pictures  Yeah  a few people. Have a friend talk you through  Or have a go  making it up as you go along  Quite a few people there. Okay  so if you said A  then this means that you are a visual learner and you learn best when information is presented in a visual style. If you said B  it means you're an auditory learner  that you learn best when information is presented to you in an auditory format. And if you said C  it means that you're a kinesthetic learner  that you learn best when you get stuck in and do things with your hands. Except  of course  as you've probably guessed  that it doesn't  because the whole thing is a complete myth. Learning styles are made up and are  not supported by scientific evidence. So we know this because in tightly controlled experimental studies  when learners are given material to learn either in their preferred style or an opposite style  it makes no difference at all to the amount of information that they retain. And if you think about it for just a second  it's just obvious that this has to be true. It's obvious that the best presentation format depends not on you  but on what you're trying to learn. Could you learn to drive a car  for example  just by listening to someone telling you what to do with no kinesthetic experience  Could you solve simultaneous equations by talking them through in your head and without writing them down  Could you revise  for your architecture exams using interpretive dance if you're a kinesthetic learner  No. What you need to do  is match the material to be learned to the presentation format  not you. I know many of you are A level students that will have recently gotten your GCSE results. And if you didn't quite get what you were hoping for  then you can't really blame your learning style  but one thing that you might want to think about blaming is your genes. So what this is all about is a recent study at University College London found that    percent of the variation between different students and their GCSE results was down to genetic factors. That sounds like a very precise figure  so how can we tell  Well  when we want to unpack the relative contributions of genes and the environment  what we can do is do a twin study. So identical twins share     percent of their environment and     percent of their genes  whereas non identical twins share     percent of their environment  but just like any brother and sister  share only    percent of their genes. So by comparing how similar GCSE results are in identical twins versus non identical twins  and doing some clever math  we can an idea of how much variation and performance is due to the environment and how much is due to genes. And it turns out that it's about    percent due to genes. So this isn't to undermine the hard work that you and your teachers here put in. If you didn't quite get the GCSE results that you were hoping for  then you can always try blaming your parents  or at least their genes. One thing that you shouldn't blame is being a left brained or right brained learner  because again  this is a myth. So the myth here is that the left brain is logical  it's good with equations like this  and the right brain is more creative  so the right brain is better at music. But again  this is a myth because nearly everything that you do involves nearly all parts of your brain talking together  even just the most mundane thing like having a normal conversation. However  perhaps one reason why this myth has survived is that there is a slight grain of truth to it. So a related version of the myth is that left handed people are more creative than right handed people  which kind of makes sense because your brain controls the opposite hands  so left handed people  the right side of the brain is slightly more active than the left hand side of the brain  and the idea is the right hand side is more creative. Now  it isn't true per se that left handed people are more creative than right handed people. What is true that ambidextrous people  or people who use both hands for different tasks  are more creative thinkers than one handed people  because being ambidextrous involves having both sides of the brain talk to each other a lot  which seems to be involved in creating flexible thinking. The myth of the creative left hander arises from the fact that being ambidextrous is more common amongst  left handers than right handers  so a grain of truth in the idea of the creative left hander  but not much. A related myth that you've probably heard of is that we only use    percent of our brains. This is  again  a complete myth. Nearly everything that we do  even the most mundane thing  uses nearly all of our brains. That said  it is of course true that most of us don't use our brainpower quite as well as we could. So what could we do to boost our brainpower  Maybe we could listen to a nice bit of Mozart. Have you heard of the idea of the Mozart effect  So the idea is that listening  to Mozart makes you smarter and improves your  performance on I.Q. tests. Now again  what's interesting about this myth is that although it's basically a myth  there is a grain of truth to it. So the original study found that participants who were played Mozart music for a few minutes did better on a subsequent I.Q. test than participants who simply sat in silence. But a follow up study recruited some people who liked Mozart music and then another group of people who were fans of  the horror stories of Stephen King. And they played the people the music or the stories. The people who preferred Mozart music to the stories got a bigger I.Q. boost from the Mozart than the stories  but the people who preferred the stories to the Mozart music got a bigger I.Q. boost from listening to the Stephen King stories than the Mozart music. So the truth is that listening to something that you enjoy perks you up a bit and gives you a temporary I.Q. boost on a narrow range of tasks. There's no suggestion that listening to Mozart  or indeed Stephen King stories  is going to make you any smarter in the long run. Another version of the Mozart myth is that listening to Mozart can make you not only cleverer but healthier  too. Unfortunately  this doesn't seem to be true of someone who listened to the music of Mozart almost every day  Mozart himself  who suffered from gonorrhea  smallpox  arthritis  and  what most people think eventually killed him in the end  syphilis. This suggests that Mozart should have bit more careful  perhaps  when choosing his sexual partners. But how do we choose a partner  So a myth that I have to say is sometimes spread a bit by sociologists is that our preferences in a romantic  partner are a product of our culture  that they're very culturally specific. But in fact  the data don't back this up. A famous study surveyed people from      different cultures across the globe  from Americans to Zulus  on what they look for in a partner. And in every single culture across the globe  men placed more value on physical attractiveness in a partner than did women  and in every single culture  too  women placed more importance than did men on ambition and high earning power. In every culture  too  men preferred women who were younger than themselves  an average of  I think it was  .   years  and in every culture  too  women preferred men who were older than them  so an average of  .   years  which is why we've got here  Everybody needs a Sugar Daddy.  So moving on from trying to score with a partner to trying to score in basketball or football or whatever your sport is. The myth here is that sportsmen go through hot hand streaks  Americans call them  or purple patches  we sometimes say in England  where they just can't miss  like this guy here. But in fact  what happens is that if you analyze the pattern of hits and misses statistically  it turns out that it's nearly always at random. Your brain creates patterns from the randomness. If you toss a coin  a streak of heads or tails is going  to come out somewhere in the randomness  and because the brain likes to see patterns where there are none  we look at these streaks and attribute meanings to them and say   Yeah he's really on form today   whereas actually you would get the same pattern if you were just getting hits and misses at random. So an exception to this  however  is penalty shootouts. A recent study looking at penalty shootouts in football shows that players who represent countries with a very bad record in penalty shootouts  like  for example  England  tend to be quicker to take their shots than countries with a better record  and presumably as a result  they're more likely to miss. Which raises the question of if there's any way that we could improve people's performance. And one thing you might think about doing is punishing people for their misses and seeing if that improves them. This idea  the effect that punishment can improve performance  is what participants thought they were testing in Milgram's famous learning and punishment experiment that you've probably heard about if you're a psychology student. The story goes that participants were prepared to give what they believed to be fatal electric shocks to a fellow participant when they got a question wrong  just because someone in a white coat told them to. But this story is a myth for three reasons. Firstly and most crucially  the lab coat wasn't white  it was in fact grey. Secondly  the participants were told before the study and reminded any time they raised a concern  that although the shocks were painful  they were not fatal and indeed caused no permanent damage whatsoever. And thirdly  participants didn't give the shocks just because someone in the coat told them to. When they were interviewed after the study  all the participants said that they firmly believed that the learning and punishment study served a worthy scientific purpose which would have enduring gains for science as opposed to the momentary nonfatal discomfort caused to the participants. Okay  so I've been talking for about    minutes now  and you've probably been  sitting there listening to me  analyzing my speech patterns  and body language and trying to work out if you should take any notice of what I'm saying  whether I'm telling the truth or whether I'm lying  but if so you've probably completely failed  because although we all think we can catch a liar from their body language and speech patterns  hundreds of psychological tests over the years have shown that all of us  including police officers and detectives  are basically at chance when it comes to detecting lies from body language and verbal patterns. Interestingly  there is one exception  TV appeals for missing relatives. It's quite easy to predict when the relatives are missing and when the appealers have in fact murdered the relatives themselves. So hoax appealers are more likely to shake their heads  to look away  and to make errors in their speech  whereas genuine appealers are more likely to express hope that the person will return safely and to avoid brutal language. So  for example  they might say  taken from us  rather than  killed.  Speaking of which  it's about time I killed this talk  but before I do  I just want  to give you in    seconds the overarching myth of psychology. So the myth is that psychology is just a collection of interesting theories  all of which say something useful and all of which have something to offer. What I hope to have shown you in the past few minutes is that this isn't true. What we need to do is assess psychological theories by seeing what predictions they make  whether that is that listening to Mozart makes you smarter  that you learn better when information is presented in your preferred learning style or whatever it is  all of these are testable empirical predictions  and the only way we can make progress is to test these predictions against the data in tightly controlled experimental studies. And it's only by doing so that we can hope to discover which of these theories are well supported  and which  like all the ones I've told you about today  are myths. Thank you. Some years ago  I stumbled across a simple design exercise that helps people understand and solve complex problems  and like many of these design exercises  it kind of seems trivial at first  but under deep inspection  it turns out that it reveals unexpected truths about the way that we collaborate and make sense of things. The exercise has three parts and begins with something that we all know how to do  which is how to make toast. It begins with a clean sheet of paper  a felt marker  and without using any words  you begin to draw how to make toast. And most people draw something like this. They draw a loaf of bread   which is sliced  then put into a toaster. The toast is then deposited for some time. It pops up  and then voila  After two minutes  toast and happiness. Now  over the years  I've collected many hundreds of drawings of these toasts  and some of them are very good  because they really illustrate the toast making process quite clearly. And then there are some that are  well  not so good. They really suck  actually  because you don't know what they're trying to say. Under close inspection  some reveal some aspects of toast making while hiding others. So there's some that are all about the toast  and all about the transformation of toast. And there's others that are all about the toaster  and the engineers love to draw the mechanics of this. And then there are others that are about people. It's about visualizing the experience that people have. And then there are others that are about the supply chain of making toast that goes all the way back to the store. It goes through the supply chain networks of teleportation and all the way back to the field and wheat  and one all actually goes all the way back to the Big Bang. So it's crazy stuff. But I think it's obvious that even though these drawings are really wildly different  they share a common quality  and I'm wondering if you can see it. Do you see it  What's common about these  Most drawings have nodes and links. So nodes represent the tangible objects like the toaster and people  and links represent the connections between the nodes. And it's the combination of links and nodes that produces a full systems model  and it makes our private mental models visible about how we think something works. So that's the value of these things. What's interesting about these systems models is how they reveal our various points of view. So for example  Americans make toast with a toaster. That seems obvious. Whereas many Europeans make toast with a frying pan  of course  and many students make toast with a fire. I don't really understand this. A lot of MBA students do this. So you can measure the complexity by counting the number of nodes  and the average illustration has between four and eight nodes. Less than that  the drawing seems trivial  but it's quick to understand  and more than     the drawing produces a feeling of map shock. It's too complex. So the sweet spot is between   and   . So if you want to communicate something visually  have between five and    nodes in your diagram. So though we may not be skilled at drawing  the point is that we intuitively know how to break down complex things into simple things and then  bring them back together again. So this brings us to our second part of  the exercise  which is how to make toast  but now with sticky notes or with cards. So what happens then  Well  with cards  most people tend to draw clear  more detailed  and more logical nodes. You can see the step by step analysis that takes place  and as they build up their model  they move their nodes around  rearranging them like Lego blocks. Now  though this might seem trivial  it's actually really important. This rapid iteration of expressing and then reflecting and analyzing is really the only way in which we get clarity. It's the essence of the design process. And systems theorists do tell us that the ease with which we can change a representation correlates to our willingness to improve the model. So sticky note systems are not only more fluid  they generally produce way more nodes than static drawings. The drawings are much richer. And this brings us to our third part of the exercise  which is to draw how to make toast  but this time in a group. So what happens then  Well  here's what happens. It starts out messy  and then it gets really messy  and then it gets messier  but as people refine the models  the best nodes become more prominent  and with each iteration  the model becomes clearer because people build on top of each other's ideas. What emerges is a unified systems model that integrates the diversity of everyone's individual points of view  so that's a really different outcome from what usually happens  in meetings  isn't it  So these drawings can contain    or more nodes  but participants don't feel map shock because they participate in the building of their models themselves. Now  what's also really interesting  that the groups spontaneously mix and add additional layers of organization to it. To deal with contradictions  for example  they add branching patterns and parallel patterns. Oh  and by the way  if they do it in complete silence  they do it much better and much more quickly. Really interesting    talking gets in the way. So here's some key lessons that can emerge from this. First  drawing helps us understand the situations as systems with nodes and their relationships. Movable cards produce better systems models  because we iterate much more fluidly. And then the group notes produce  the most comprehensive models because we synthesize several points of view. So that's interesting. When people work together under the right circumstances  group models are much better than individual models. So this approach works really great for drawing how to make toast  but what if you wanted to draw something more relevant or pressing  like your organizational vision  or customer experience  or long term sustainability  There's a visual revolution that's taking place as more organizations are addressing their wicked problems by collaboratively drawing them out. And I'm convinced that those who see their world as movable nodes and links really have an edge. And the practice is really pretty simple. You start with a question  you collect the nodes  you refine the nodes  you do it over again  you refine and refine and refine  and the patterns emerge  and the group gets clarity and you answer the question. So this simple act of visualizing and doing over and over again produces some really remarkable outcomes. What's really important to know is that it's the conversations that are the important aspects  not just the models themselves. And these visual frames of reference can grow to several hundreds or even thousands of nodes. So  one example is from an organization called Rodale. Big publishing company. They lost a bunch of money one year  and their executive team for three days visualized their entire practice. And what's interesting is that after visualizing the entire business  systems upon systems  they reclaimed     million dollars of revenue  and they also moved from a D rating  to an A rating from their customers. Why  Because there's alignment from the executive team. So I'm now on a mission to help organizations solve their wicked problems by using collaborative visualization  and on a site that I've produced called drawtoast.com  I've collected a bunch of best practices. and so you can learn how to run a workshop here  you can learn more about the visual language and the structure of links and nodes that you can apply to general problem solving  and download examples of various templates for unpacking the thorny problems that we all face in our organizations. So the seemingly trivial design exercise of drawing toast helps us get clear  engaged and aligned. So next time you're confronted with an interesting challenge  remember what design has to teach us. Make your ideas visible  tangible  and consequential. It's simple  it's fun  it's powerful  and I believe it's an idea worth celebrating. Thank you. I'm an artist and I cut books. This is one of my first book works. It's called  Alternate Route to Knowledge.  I wanted to create a stack of books so that somebody could come into the gallery and think they're just looking at a regular stack of books  but then as they got closer they would see this rough hole carved into it  and wonder what was happening  wonder why  and think about the material of the book. So I'm interested in the texture  but I'm more interested in the text and the images that we find within books. In most of my work  what I do is I seal the edges of a book with a thick varnish so it's creating sort of a skin on the outside of the book so it becomes a solid material  but then the pages inside are still loose  and then I carve into the surface of the book  and I'm not moving or adding anything. I'm just carving around whatever I find interesting. So everything you see within the finished piece is exactly where it was in the book before I began. I think of my work as sort of a remix  in a way  because I'm working with somebody else's material in the same way that a D.J. might be working with somebody else's music. This was a book of Raphael paintings  the Renaissance artist  and by taking his work and remixing it  carving into it  I'm sort of making it into something that's more new and more contemporary. I'm thinking also about breaking out of the box of the traditional book and pushing that linear format  and try to push the structure of the book itself so that the book can become fully sculptural. I'm using clamps and ropes and all sorts of materials  weights  in order to hold things  in place before I varnish so that I can push the form  before I begin  so that something like this can become a piece like this  which is just made from a single dictionary. Or something like this can become a piece like this. Or something like this  which who knows what that's going to be or why that's in my studio  will become a piece like this. So I think one of the reasons people are disturbed by destroying books  people don't want to rip books and nobody really wants to throw away a book  is that we think about books as living things  we think about them as a body  and they're created to relate to our body  as far as scale  but they also have the potential to continue to grow and to continue to become new things. So books really are alive. So I think of the book as a body  and I think of the book as a technology. I think of the book as a tool. And I also think of the book as a machine. I also think of the book as a landscape. This is a full set of encyclopedias that's been connected and sanded together  and as I carve through it  I'm deciding what I want to choose. So with encyclopedias  I could have chosen anything  but I specifically chose images of landscapes. And with the material itself  I'm using sandpaper and sanding the edges so not only the images suggest landscape  but the material itself suggests a landscape as well. So one of the things I do is when I'm carving through the book  I'm thinking about images  but I'm also thinking about text  and I think about them in a very similar way  because what's interesting is that when we're reading text  when we're reading a book  it puts images in our head  so we're sort of filling that piece. We're sort of creating images when we're reading text  and when we're looking at an image  we actually use language in order to understand what we're looking at. So there's sort of a yin yang that happens  sort of a flip flop. So I'm creating a piece that the viewer is completing themselves. And I think of my work as almost an archaeology. I'm excavating and I'm trying to maximize the potential and discover as much as I possibly can and exposing it within my own work. But at the same time  I'm thinking about this idea of erasure  and what's happening now that most of our information is intangible  and this idea of loss  and this idea that not only is the format constantly shifting within computers  but the information itself  now that we don't have a physical backup  has to be constantly updated in order to not lose it. And I have several dictionaries in my own studio  and I do use a computer every day  and if I need to look up a word  I'll go on the computer  because I can go directly and instantly to what I'm looking up. I think that the book was never really the right format for nonlinear information  which is why we're seeing reference books becoming the first to be  endangered or extinct. So I don't think that the book will ever really die. People think that now that we have digital technology  the book is going to die  and we are seeing things shifting and things evolving. I think that the book will evolve  and just like people said painting would die when photography and printmaking became everyday materials  but what it really allowed painting to do was it allowed painting to quit its day job. It allowed painting to not have to have that everyday chore of telling the story  and painting became free and was allowed to tell its own story  and that's when we saw Modernism emerge  and we saw painting go into different branches. And I think that's what's happening with books now  now that most of our technology  most of our information  most of our personal and cultural  records are in digital form  I think it's really allowing the book to become something new. So I think it's a very exciting time for an artist like me  and it's very exciting to see what will happen with the book in the future. Thank you. So infectious diseases  right  Infectious diseases  are still the main cause of human suffering and death  around the world. Every year  millions of people die of diseases such as T.B.  malaria  HIV  around the world  and even in the United States. Every year  thousands of Americans die of seasonal flu. Now of course  humans  we are creative. Right  We have come up with ways to protect ourselves against these diseases. We have drugs and vaccines. And we're conscious    we learn from our experiences and come up with creative solutions. We used to think we're alone in this  but now we know we're not. We're not the only medical doctors. Now we know that there's a lot of animals out there that can do it too. Most famous  perhaps  chimpanzees. Not so much different from us  they can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites. But the last few decades have shown us that other animals can do it too  elephants  porcupines  sheep  goats  you name it. And even more interesting than that is that recent discoveries are telling us that insects and other little animals with smaller brains can use medication too. The problem with infectious diseases  as we all know  is that pathogens continue to evolve  and a lot of the drugs that we have developed are losing their efficacy. And therefore  there is this great need to find new ways to discover drugs that we can use against our diseases. Now  I think that we should look at these animals  and we can learn from them how to treat our own diseases. As a biologist  I have been studying monarch butterflies for the last    years. Now  monarchs are extremely famous for their spectacular migrations from the U.S. and Canada down to Mexico every year  where millions of them come together  but it's not why I started studying them. I study monarchs because they get sick. They get sick like you. They get sick like me. And I think what they do can tell us a lot about drugs that we can develop for humans. Now  the parasites that monarchs get infected with are called ophryocystis elektroscirrha    a mouthful. What they do is they produce spores  millions of spores on the outside of the butterfly that are shown as little specks in between the scales of the butterfly. And this is really detrimental to the monarch. It shortens their lifespan  it reduces their ability to fly  it can even kill them before they're even adults. Very detrimental parasite. As part of my job  I spend a lot of time in the greenhouse growing plants  and the reason for this is that monarchs are extremely picky eaters. They only eat milkweed as larvae. Luckily  there are several species of milkweed that they can use  and all these milkweeds have cardenolides in them. These are chemicals that are toxic. They're toxic to most animals  but not to monarchs. In fact  monarchs can take up the chemicals  put it in their own bodies  and it makes them toxic against their predators  such as birds. And what they do  then  is advertise this toxicity through their beautiful warning colorations with this orange  black and white. So what I did during my job is grow plants in the greenhouse  different ones  different milkweeds. Some were toxic  including the tropical milkweed  with very high concentrations of these cardenolides. And some were not toxic. And then I fed them to monarchs. Some of the monarchs were healthy. They had no disease. But some of the monarchs were sick  and what I found is that some of these milkweeds are medicinal  meaning they reduce the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies  meaning these monarchs can live longer when they are infected when feeding on these medicinal plants. And when I found this  I had this idea  and a lot of people said it was a crazy idea  but I thought   what if monarchs can use this  What if they can use these plants as their own form of medicine  What if they can act as medical doctors  So my team and I started doing experiments. In the first types of experiments  we had caterpillars  and gave them a choice  medicinal milkweed versus non medicinal milkweed. And then we measured how much they ate of each species over their lifetime. And the result  as so often  in science  was boring  Fifty percent of their food was medicinal. Fifty percent was not. These caterpillars didn't do anything for their own welfare. So then we moved on to adult butterflies  and we started asking the question whether it's the mothers that can medicate their offspring. Can the mothers lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future offspring less sick  We have done these experiments now over several years  and always get the same results. What we do is we put a monarch in a big cage  a medicinal plant on one side  a non medicinal plant on the other side  and then we measure the number of eggs that the monarchs lay on each plant. And what we find when we do that is always the same. What we find is that the monarchs strongly prefer the medicinal milkweed. In other words  what these females are doing is they're laying    percent of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed. Intriguingly  what they do is they actually transmit the parasites when they're laying the eggs. They cannot prevent this. They can also not medicate themselves. But what these experiments tell us is that these monarchs  these mothers  can lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future offspring less sick. Now  this is a really important discovery  I think  not just because it tells us something cool about nature  but also because it may tell us something more about how we should find drugs. Now  these are animals that are very small and we tend to think of them as very simple. They have tiny little brains  yet they can do this very sophisticated medication. Now  we know that even today  most of our drugs derive from natural products  including plants  and in indigenous cultures  traditional healers often look at animals to find new drugs. In this way  elephants have told us how to treat stomach upset  and porcupines have told people how to treat bloody diarrhea. What I think is important   though  is to move beyond these large brained mammals and give these guys more credit  these simple animals  these insects that we tend to think of as very  very simple with tiny little brains. The discovery that these animals can also use medication opens up completely new avenues  and I think that maybe one day  we will be treating human diseases with drugs that were first discovered by butterflies  and I think that is an amazing opportunity worth pursuing. Thank you so much. On Mondays and Thursdays  I learn how to die. I call them my terminal days. My wife Fernanda doesn't like the term  but a lot of people in my family died of melanoma cancer and my parents and grandparents had it. And I kept thinking  one day I could be sitting in front of a doctor who looks at my exams and says   Ricardo  things don't look very good. You have six months or a year to live.  And you start thinking about what you would do with this time. And you say   I'm going to spend  more time with the kids. I'm going to visit these places  I'm going to go up and down mountains and places and I'm going to do all the things I didn't do when I had the time.  But of course  we all know these are very bittersweet memories  we're going to have. It's very difficult to do. You spend a good part of the time crying  probably. So I said  I'm going to do something else. Every Monday and Thursday  I'm going use my terminal days. And I will do  during those days  whatever it is I was going to do if I had received that piece of news. When you think about    when you think about the opposite of work  we  many times  think it's leisure. And you say  ah  I need  some leisure time  and so forth. But the fact is that  leisure is a very busy thing. You go play golf and tennis  and you meet people  and you're going for lunch  and you're late for the movies. It's a very crowded thing that we do. The opposite of work is idleness. But very few of us know what to do with idleness. When you look at the way that we distribute our lives in general  you realize that in the periods in which we have a lot of money  we have very little time. And then when we finally have time  we have neither the money nor the health. So we started thinking about that as a company for the last    years. This is a complicated company with thousands of employees  hundreds of millions of dollars of business that makes rocket fuel propellent systems  runs       ATMs in Brazil  does income tax preparation for dozens of thousands. So this is not a simple business. We looked at it and we said  let's devolve to these people  let's give these people a company where we take away all the boarding school aspects of  this is when you arrive  this is how you dress  this is how you go to meetings  this is what you say  this is what you don't say  and let's see what's left. So we started this about    years ago  and we started dealing with this very issue. And so we said  look  the retirement  the whole issue of how  we distribute our graph of life. Instead of going mountain climbing when you're     why don't you do it next week  And we'll do it like this  we'll sell you back your Wednesdays for    percent of your salary. So now  if you were going to be  a violinist  which you probably weren't  you go and do this on Wednesday. And what we found    we thought  these are the older people who are going to be really interested in this program. And the average age of the first people who adhered were     of course. And so we started looking  and we said  we have to do things in a different way. So we started saying things like  why do we want to know what time you came to work  what time you left  etc.  Can't we exchange this for a contract for buying something from you  some kind of work  Why are we building these headquarters  Is it not an ego issue that we want to look solid and big and important  But we're dragging you two hours across town because of it  So we started asking questions one by one. We'd say it like this  One  How do we find people  We'd go out and try and recruit people and we'd say  look  when you come to us  we're not going to have two or three interviews and then you're going to be married to us for life. That's not how we do  the rest of our lives. So  come have your interviews. Anyone who's interested in interviewing  you will show up. And then we'll see what happens out of the intuition that rises from that  instead of just filling out the little  items of whether you're the right person. And then  come back. Spend an afternoon  spend a whole day  talk to anybody you want. Make sure we are the bride  you thought we were and not all the bullshit we put into our own ads. Slowly we went to a process  where we'd say things like  we don't want anyone to be a leader in the company if they haven't been  interviewed and approved by their future subordinates. Every six months  everyone gets  evaluated  anonymously  as a leader. And this determines whether they should continue in that leadership position  which is many times situational  as you know. And so if they don't have        percent  of a grade  they don't stay  which is probably the reason why I haven't been CEO for more than    years. And over time  we started asking other questions. We said things like  why can't people set their own salaries  What do they need to know  There's only three things  you need to know  how much people make inside the company  how much people make somewhere else in a similar business and how much we make in general to see whether we can afford it. So let's give people these three pieces of information. So we started having  in the cafeteria  a computer where you could go in  and you could ask what someone spent   how much someone makes  what they make in benefits   what the company makes  what the margins are  and so forth. And this is    years ago. As this information started  coming to people  we said things like  we don't want  to see your expense report  we don't want to know how many  holidays you're taking  we don't want to know where you work. We had  at one point     different offices around town  and we'd say  go to the one  that's closest to your house  to the customer that  you're going to visit today. Don't tell us where you are. And more  even when we had thousands of people        people  we had two people in the H.R. department  and thankfully one of them has retired. And so  the question we were asking was  how can we be taking care of people  People are the only thing we have. We can't have a department that runs after people and looks after people. So as we started finding that this worked  and we'd say  we're looking for    and this is  I think  the main thing I was looking for in the terminal days and in the company  which is  how do you set up for wisdom  We've come from an age of revolution  industrial revolution  an age of information  an age of knowledge  but we're not any closer to the age of wisdom. How we design  how do we organize  for more wisdom  So for example  many times  what's the smartest or the intelligent decision doesn't jive. So we'd say things like  let's agree that you're going to sell    widgets per week. If you sell them by Wednesday   please go to the beach. Don't create a problem for us   for manufacturing  for application  then we have to buy new companies  we have to buy our competitors  we have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many widgets. So go to the beach and start again on Monday. So the process is looking for wisdom. And in the process  of course   we wanted people to know everything  and we wanted to be truly democratic about the way we ran things. So our board had two seats open  with the same voting rights  for the first two people who showed up. And so we had cleaning ladies voting on a board meeting  which had a lot of other very important people in suits and ties. And the fact is that they kept us honest. This process  as we started looking at the people who came to us  we'd say  now wait a second  people come to us and they say  where am I supposed to sit  How am I supposed to work  Where am I going to be in   years' time  And we looked at that and we said  we have to start much earlier. Where do we start  We said  oh  kindergarten  seems like a good place. So we set up a foundation  which now has   for    years  three schools  where we started asking the same questions  how do you redesign school for wisdom  It is one thing to say  we need to recycle the teachers  we need the directors to do more. But the fact is that what we do with education is entirely obsolete. The teacher's role is entirely obsolete. Going from a math class  to biology  to   th century France is very silly. So we started thinking   what could it look like  And we put together people   including people who like education  people like Paulo Freire   and two ministers of education in Brazil and we said  if we were to design a school from scratch  what would it look like  And so we created this school  which is called Lumiar  and Lumiar  one of them is a public school  and Lumiar says the following  Let's divide this role of the teacher into two. One guy  we'll call a tutor. A tutor  in the old sense of the Greek  paideia   Look after the kid. What's happening at home  what's their moment in life  etc.. But please don't teach  because the little you know compared  to Google  we don't want to know. Keep that to yourself. Now  we'll bring in people who have two things  passion and expertise  and it could be their profession or not. And we use the senior citizens  who are    percent of the population with wisdom that nobody wants anymore. So we bring them to school and we say  teach these kids whatever you really believe in. So we have violinists teaching math. We have all kinds of things where we say  don't worry about  the course material anymore. We have approximately    great threads that go from   to   . Things like  how do we measure ourselves as humans  So there's a place for math and physics and all that there. How do we express ourselves  So there's a place for music and literature  etc.  but also for grammar. And then we have things that everyone has forgotten  which are probably the most  important things in life. The very important things in life  we know nothing about. We know nothing about love  we know nothing about death  we know nothing about why we're here. So we need a thread in school that talks about everything we don't know. So that's a big part of what we do. So over the years  we started going into other things. We'd say  why do we have to scold the kids and say  sit down and come here  and do that  and so forth. We said  let's get the kids to do  something we call a circle  which meets once a week. And we'd say  you put the rules together and then you decide what you want to do with it. So can you all hit yourself on the head  Sure  for a week  try. They came up with the very same rules that we had  except they're theirs. And then  they have the power  which means  they can and do suspend and expel kids so that we're not playing school  they really decide. And then  in this same vein  we keep a digital mosaic  because this is not constructivist or Montessori or something. It's something where we keep the Brazilian curriculum with     tiles of a mosaic  which we want to expose these kids to by the time they're   . And follow this all the time and we know how they're doing and we say  you're not interested  in this now  let's wait a year. And the kids are in groups that don't have an age category  so the six year old kid who is ready for that with an    year old  that eliminates all of the gangs and the groups and this stuff that we have  in the schools  in general. And they have a zero  to     percent grading  which they do themselves with an app every couple of hours. Until we know they're    percent of the way we'd like them to be on this issue  so that we can send them out in the world with them knowing enough about it. And so the courses are World Cup Soccer  or building a bicycle. And people will sign up for  a    day course on building a bicycle. Now  try to build a bicycle without  knowing that pi is  .    . You can't. And try  any one of you   using  .     for something. You don't know anymore. So this is lost and that's what  we try to do there  which is looking  for wisdom in that school. And that brings us back to this graph and this distribution of our life. I accumulated a lot of money  when I think about it. When you think and you say  now is the time to give back    well  if you're giving back   you took too much. I keep thinking of Warren Buffet waking up one day and finding out he has    billion dollars more than he thought he had. And he looks and he says  what am I going to do with this  And he says  I'll give it to someone who really needs this. I'll give it to Bill Gates.  Laughter  And my guy  who's my financial advisor in New York  he says  look  you're a silly guy because you would have  .  times  more money today if you had made money with money instead of sharing as you go. But I like sharing as you go better. I taught MBAs at MIT for a time and I ended up  one day  at the Mount Auburn Cemetery. It is a beautiful cemetery in Cambridge. And I was walking around. It was my birthday and I was thinking. And the first time around   I saw these tombstones and these wonderful people  who'd done great things and I thought  what do I want  to be remembered for  And I did another stroll around  and the second time  another question came to me  which did me better  which was  why do I want to be remembered at all  And that  I think   took me different places. When I was     my wife Fernanda and I sat for a whole afternoon  we had a big pit with fire  and I threw everything I had ever  done into that fire. This is a book in    languages  hundreds and hundreds of articles and DVDs  everything there was. And that did two things. One  it freed our five kids from following in our steps  our shadow    They don't know what I do. Which is good. And I'm not going to take them somewhere and say  one day  all of this will be yours. The five kids know nothing  which is good. And the second thing is  I freed myself from this anchor of past achievement or whatever. I'm free to start something new every time and to decide things from scratch in part of those terminal days. And some people would say  oh  so now you have this time  these terminal days  and so you go out and do everything. No  we've been to the beaches  so we've been to Samoa and Maldives and Mozambique  so that's done. I've climbed mountains in the Himalayas. I've gone down    meters to see  hammerhead sharks. I've spent    days on the back of a camel from Chad to Timbuktu. I've gone to the magnetic  North Pole on a dog sled. So  we've been busy. It's what I'd like to call  my empty bucket list. And with this rationale  I look at these days and I think  I'm not retired.  I don't feel retired at all. And so I'm writing a new book. We started three new companies in the last two years. I'm now working on getting this  school system for free out into the world  and I've found  very interestingly enough  that nobody wants it for free. And so I've been trying for    years to get the public system to take over this school rationale  much as the public schools we have  which has instead of    out of      as their rating  as their grades  has    out of    . But for free  nobody wants it. So maybe we'll start charging for it  and then it will go somewhere. But getting this out is one of the things we want to do. And I think what this leaves us as a message for all of you  I think is a little bit like this  We've all learned how to go on Sunday night to email and work from home. But very few of us have learned how to go to the movies on Monday afternoon. And if we're looking for wisdom  we need to learn to do that as well. And so  what we've done all of these years is very simple  is use the little tool  which is ask three whys in a row. Because the first why you always have a good answer for. The second why  it starts getting difficult. By the third why  you don't really know why you're doing what you're doing. What I want to leave you with is the seed and the thought that maybe if you do this  you will come to the question  what for  What am I doing this for  And hopefully  as a result of that  and over time  I hope that with this  and that's what I'm wishing you  you'll have a much wiser future. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  So Ricardo   you're kind of crazy. To many people  this seems crazy. And yet so deeply wise  also. The pieces I'm trying to put together are this  Your ideas are so radical. How  in business  for example  these ideas have been out for a while  probably the percentage of businesses  that have taken some of them is still quite low. Are there any times you've seen  some big company take on one of your ideas  and you've gone   Yes    Ricardo Semler  It happens. It happened about two weeks ago with Richard Branson  with his people saying  oh  I don't want to control your holidays anymore  or Netflix does a little bit of this and that  but I don't think it's very important. I'd like to see it happen maybe a little bit in a bit of a missionary zeal  but that's a very personal one. But the fact is that it takes a leap  of faith about losing control. And almost nobody who is in control is ready to take leaps of faith. It will have to come from kids  and other people who are starting companies  in a different way. CA  So that's the key thing  From your point of view the evidence is there  in the business point of view this works  but people just don't have the courage to     Whoosh  RS  They don't even have the incentive. You're running a company with a    day mandate. It's a quarterly report. If you're not good in    days  you're out. So you say   Here's a great program that  in less than one generation     And the guy says   Get out of here.  So this is the problem. CA  What you're trying to do in education seems to me incredibly profound. Everyone is bothered about their country's education system. No one thinks that we've caught up yet to a world where there's Google and all these  technological options. So you've got actual evidence now that  the kids so far going through your system  there's a dramatic increase  in performance. How do we help you move these ideas forward  RS  I think it's that problem of ideas whose time has come. And I've never been very evangelical about these things. We put it out there. Suddenly  you find people    there's a group in Japan   which scares me very much  which is called the Semlerists  and they have     companies. They've invited me. I've always been scared to go. And there is a group in Holland that has     small  Dutch companies. It's something that will flourish on its own. Part of it will be wrong   and it doesn't matter. This will find its own place. And I'm afraid of the other one  which says  this is so good you've got to do this. Let's set up a system  and put lots of money into it and then people will do it no matter what. CA  So you have asked  extraordinary questions your whole life. It seems to me that's the fuel  that's driven a lot of this. Do you have any other questions for us  for TED  for this group here  RS  I always come back  to variations of the question that my son asked me when he was three. We were sitting in a jacuzzi  and he said   Dad  why do we exist   There is no other question. Nobody has any other question. We have variations of this one question  from three onwards. So when you spend time in a company  in a bureaucracy  in an organization and you're saying  boy    how many people do you know who on their death beds said  boy  I wish I had spent more time at the office  So there's a whole thing  of having the courage now    not in a week  not in two months  not when you find out  you have something    to say  no  what am I doing this for  Stop everything. Let me do something else. And it will be okay  it will be much better than what you're doing  if you're stuck in a process. CA  So that strikes me as a profound and quite beautiful way to end this penultimate day of TED. Ricardo Semler  thank you so much. RS  Thank you so much. What's the fastest growing threat to Americans' health  Cancer  Heart attacks  Diabetes  The answer is actually none of these  it's Alzheimer's disease. Every    seconds  someone in the United States is diagnosed with Alzheimer's. As the number of Alzheimer's patients triples by the year       caring for them  as well as the rest of the aging population  will become an overwhelming societal challenge. My family has experienced firsthand the struggles of caring for an Alzheimer's patient. Growing up in a family with three generations  I've always been very close to my grandfather. When I was four years old  my grandfather and I  were walking in a park in Japan when he suddenly got lost. It was one of the scariest moments I've ever experienced in my life  and it was also the first instance that informed us that my grandfather had Alzheimer's disease. Over the past    years  his condition got worse and worse  and his wandering in particular caused my family a lot of stress. My aunt  his primary caregiver  really struggled to stay awake at night to keep an eye on him  and even then often failed to catch him leaving the bed. I became really concerned about my aunt's well being as well as my grandfather's safety. I searched extensively for a solution that could help my family's problems  but couldn't find one. Then  one night about two years ago  I was looking after my grandfather and I saw him stepping out of the bed. The moment his foot landed on the floor  I thought  why don't I put a pressure sensor on the heel of his foot  Once he stepped onto the floor and out of the bed  the pressure sensor would detect an increase in pressure caused by body weight and then wirelessly send an audible alert to the caregiver's smartphone. That way  my aunt could sleep much better at night without having to worry about my grandfather's wandering. So now I'd like to perform a demonstration of this sock. Could I please have my sock model on the stage  Great. So once the patient steps onto the floor    an alert is sent to the caregiver's smartphone. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you  sock model. So this is a drawing of my preliminary design. My desire to create a sensor based technology perhaps stemmed from my lifelong love for sensors and technology. When I was six years old  an elderly family friend fell down in the bathroom and suffered severe injuries. I became concerned about my own grandparents and decided to invent a smart bathroom system. Motion sensors would be installed inside the tiles of bathroom floors to detect the falls of elderly patients whenever they fell down in the bathroom. Since I was only six years old at the time and I hadn't graduated from kindergarten yet  I didn't have the necessary resources and  tools to translate my idea into reality  but nonetheless  my research experience really implanted in me a firm desire to use sensors to help the elderly people. I really believe that sensors can improve the quality of life of the elderly. When I laid out my plan  I realized that I faced three main challenges  first  creating a sensor  second  designing a circuit  and third  coding a smartphone app. This made me realize that my project was actually much harder to realize than I initially had thought it to be. First  I had to create a wearable sensor that was thin and flexible enough to be worn comfortably on the bottom of the patient's foot. After extensive research and testing of different materials like rubber  which I realized was too thick to be worn snugly on the bottom of the foot  I decided to print a film sensor with electrically conductive pressure sensitive ink particles. Once pressure is applied  the connectivity between the particles increases. Therefore  I could design a circuit that would measure pressure by measuring electrical resistance. Next  I had to design a wearable wireless circuit  but wireless signal transmission consumes lots of power and requires heavy  bulky batteries. Thankfully  I was able to find out about the Bluetooth low energy technology  which consumes very little power and can be driven by a coin sized battery. This prevented the system from dying in the middle of the night. Lastly  I had to code a smartphone app that would essentially transform the care giver's smartphone into a remote monitor. For this  I had to expand upon my knowledge of coding with Java and XCode and I also had to learn about how to code for Bluetooth low energy devices by watching YouTube tutorials and reading various textbooks. Integrating these components  I was able to successfully create two prototypes  one in which the sensor is embedded inside a sock  and another that's a re attachable sensor assembly that can be adhered anywhere that makes contact with the bottom of the patient's foot. I've tested the device on my grandfather for about a year now  and it's had a     percent success rate in detecting the over      known cases of his wandering. Last summer  I was able to beta test my device at several residential care facilities in California  and I'm currently incorporating the feedback to further improve the device  into a marketable product. Testing the device on a number of patients made me realize that I needed to invent solutions for people who didn't want to wear socks to sleep at night. So sensor data  collected on a vast number of patients  can be useful for improving patient care and also leading to a cure for the disease  possibly. For example  I'm currently examining correlations between the frequency of a patient's nightly wandering and his or her daily activities and diet. One thing I'll never forget is when my device first caught my grandfather's wandering out of bed at night. At that moment  I was really struck by the power of technology to change lives for the better. People living happily and healthfully    that's the world that I imagine. Thank you very much. Today I want to talk to you about the mathematics of love. Now  I think that we can all agree that mathematicians are famously excellent at finding love. But it's not just because of our dashing personalities  superior conversational skills and excellent pencil cases. It's also because we've actually done an awful lot of work into the maths of how to find the perfect partner. Now  in my favorite paper on the subject  which is entitled   Why I Don't Have a Girlfriend      Laughter     Peter Backus tries to rate his chances of finding love. Now  Peter's not a very greedy man. Of all of the available women in the U.K.  all Peter's looking for is somebody who lives near him  somebody in the right age range  somebody with a university degree  somebody he's likely to get on well with  somebody who's likely to be attractive  somebody who's likely  to find him attractive. And comes up with an estimate of    women in the whole of the UK. It's not looking very good   is it Peter  Now  just to put that into perspective  that's about     times fewer than the best estimates of how many intelligent extraterrestrial life forms there are. And it also gives Peter a   in         chance of bumping into any one of these special ladies on a given night out. I'd like to think that's why mathematicians don't really bother going on nights out anymore. The thing is that I personally don't subscribe to such a pessimistic view. Because I know  just as well as all of you do  that love doesn't really work like that. Human emotion isn't neatly ordered and rational and easily predictable. But I also know that that doesn't mean that mathematics hasn't got something that it can offer us because  love  as with most of life  is full of patterns and mathematics is  ultimately  all about the study of patterns. Patterns from predicting the weather to the fluctuations in the stock market  to the movement of the planets or the growth of cities. And if we're being honest  none of those things are exactly neatly ordered and easily predictable  either. Because I believe that mathematics is so powerful that it has the potential to offer us a new way of looking at almost anything. Even something as mysterious as love. And so  to try to persuade you of how totally amazing  excellent and relevant mathematics is  I want to give you my top three mathematically verifiable tips for love. Okay  so Top Tip     How to win at online dating. So my favorite online dating  website is OkCupid  not least because it was started by a group of mathematicians. Now  because they're mathematicians  they have been collecting data on everybody who uses their site for almost a decade. And they've been trying  to search for patterns in the way that we talk about ourselves and the way that we  interact with each other on an online dating website. And they've come up with some seriously interesting findings. But my particular favorite is that it turns out that on an online dating website  how attractive you are does not dictate how popular you are  and actually  having people think that you're ugly can work to your advantage. Let me show you how this works. In a thankfully voluntary section of OkCupid  you are allowed to rate how attractive you think people are on a scale between   and  . Now  if we compare this score   the average score  to how many messages a selection of people receive  you can begin to get a sense of how attractiveness links to popularity on an online dating website. This is the graph that the OkCupid guys have come up with. And the important thing to notice is that it's not totally true that the more attractive you are  the more messages you get. But the question arises then of what is it about people up here who are so much more popular than people down here  even though they have the same score of attractiveness  And the reason why is that it's not just  straightforward looks that are important. So let me try to illustrate their findings with an example. So if you take someone like Portia de Rossi  for example  everybody agrees that Portia de Rossi is a very beautiful woman. Nobody thinks that she's ugly  but she's not a supermodel  either. If you compare Portia de Rossi to someone like Sarah Jessica Parker  now  a lot of people   myself included  I should say  think that Sarah Jessica Parker is seriously fabulous and possibly one of the most beautiful creatures to have ever have walked  on the face of the Earth. But some other people   i.e.  most of the Internet  seem to think that she looks  a bit like a horse.  Laughter  Now  I think that if you ask people how attractive they thought Sarah Jessica Parker  or Portia de Rossi were  and you ask them to give  them a score between   and    I reckon that they'd average out to have roughly the same score. But the way that people would vote would be very different. So Portia's scores would all be clustered around the   because everybody agrees  that she's very beautiful  whereas Sarah Jessica Parker completely divides opinion. There'd be a huge spread in her scores. And actually it's this spread that counts. It's this spread that makes you more popular on an online Internet dating website. So what that means then is that if some people think that you're attractive  you're actually better off having some other people think that you're a massive minger. That's much better than everybody just thinking that you're the cute girl next door. Now  I think this begins  makes a bit more sense when you think in terms of the people who are sending these messages. So let's say that you think somebody's attractive  but you suspect that other people won't necessarily be that interested. That means there's less competition for you and it's an extra incentive for you to get in touch. Whereas compare that  to if you think somebody is attractive but you suspect that everybody  is going to think they're attractive. Well  why would you bother  humiliating yourself  let's be honest  Here's where the really interesting part comes. Because when people choose the pictures that they use on an online dating website  they often try to minimize the things that they think some people  will find unattractive. The classic example is people who are  perhaps  a little bit overweight deliberately choosing  a very cropped photo  or bald men  for example  deliberately choosing pictures where they're wearing hats. But actually this is the opposite  of what you should do if you want to be successful. You should really  instead  play up to  whatever it is that makes you different  even if you think that some people will find it unattractive. Because the people who fancy you are just going to fancy you anyway  and the unimportant losers who don't  well  they only play up to your advantage. Okay  Top Tip     How to pick the perfect partner. So let's imagine then that you're a roaring success on the dating scene. But the question arises  of how do you then convert that success into longer term happiness and in particular  how do you decide when is the right time to settle down  Now generally  it's not advisable to just cash in and marry the first person who comes along and shows you any interest at all. But  equally  you don't really  want to leave it too long if you want to maximize your  chance of long term happiness. As my favorite author   Jane Austen  puts it   An unmarried woman of seven and twenty can never hope to feel or inspire affection again.  Thanks a lot  Jane. What do you know about love  So the question is then  how do you know when  is the right time to settle down given all the people  that you can date in your lifetime  Thankfully  there's a rather delicious bit of mathematics that we can use to help us out here  called optimal stopping theory. So let's imagine then  that you start dating when you're    and ideally  you'd like to be married by the time that you're   . And there's a number of people that you could potentially date across your lifetime  and they'll be at varying  levels of goodness. Now the rules are that once  you cash in and get married  you can't look ahead to see what you could have had  and equally  you can't go back and change your mind. In my experience at least  I find that typically people don't much like being recalled years after being passed up  for somebody else  or that's just me. So the math says then that what you should do in the first    percent  of your dating window  you should just reject everybody as serious marriage potential. And then  you should pick the  next person that comes along that is better than everybody  that you've seen before. So here's the example. Now if you do this  it can be mathematically proven  in fact  that this is the best possible way of maximizing your chances  of finding the perfect partner. Now unfortunately  I have to tell you that this method does come with some risks. For instance  imagine if  your perfect partner appeared during your first    percent. Now  unfortunately   you'd have to reject them. Now  if you're following the maths  I'm afraid no one else comes along that's better than anyone you've seen before  so you have to go on  rejecting everyone and die alone. Probably surrounded by cats nibbling at your remains. Okay  another risk is   let's imagine  instead  that the first people that you dated in your first    percent are just incredibly dull  boring  terrible people. Now  that's okay  because  you're in your rejection phase  so thats fine   you can reject them. But then imagine  the next person to come along is just marginally less boring   dull and terrible than everybody that you've seen before. Now  if you are following the maths  I'm afraid you have to marry them and end up in a relationship which is  frankly  suboptimal. Sorry about that. But I do think that there's an opportunity here for Hallmark to cash in on and really cater for this market. A Valentine's Day card like this.  Laughter   My darling husband  you are marginally less terrible than the first    percent of people I dated.  It's actually more romantic than I normally manage. Okay  so this method doesn't give you a     percent success rate  but there's no other possible strategy that can do any better. And actually  in the wild  there are certain types of fish which follow and employ this exact strategy. So they reject every possible  suitor that turns up in the first    percent  of the mating season  and then they pick the next fish that comes along after that window that's  I don't know  bigger and burlier than all of the fish  that they've seen before. I also think that subconsciously  humans  we do sort of do this anyway. We give ourselves a little bit of time to play the field  get a feel for the marketplace  or whatever when we're young. And then we only start looking seriously at potential marriage candidates once we hit our mid to late   s. I think this is conclusive proof  if ever it were needed  that everybody's brains are prewired  to be just a little bit mathematical. Okay  so that was Top Tip   . Now  Top Tip     How to avoid divorce. Okay  so let's imagine then that you picked your perfect partner and you're settling into a lifelong relationship with them. Now  I like to think that everybody would ideally like to avoid divorce  apart from  I don't know   Piers Morgan's wife  maybe  But it's a sad fact of modern life that   in   marriages in the States ends in divorce  with the rest of the world not being far behind. Now  you can be forgiven  perhaps for thinking that the arguments that precede a marital breakup are not an ideal candidate for mathematical investigation. For one thing  it's very hard to know what you should be measuring  or what you should be quantifying. But this didn't stop a psychologist  John Gottman  who did exactly that. Gottman observed hundreds of couples having a conversation and recorded  well   everything you can think of. So he recorded what was said  in the conversation  he recorded their skin conductivity  he recorded their facial expressions  their heart rates  their blood pressure  basically everything apart from whether or not the wife was actually always right  which incidentally she totally is. But what Gottman and his team found was that one of the most important predictors for whether or not a couple is going to get divorced was how positive or negative each  partner was being in the conversation. Now  couples that were very low risk scored a lot more positive points on Gottman's scale than negative. Whereas bad relationships  by which I mean  probably going to get divorced  they found themselves getting  into a spiral of negativity. Now just by using these very simple ideas  Gottman and his group were able to predict whether a given couple was going to get divorced with a    percent accuracy. But it wasn't until he teamed up with a mathematician  James Murray  that they really started to understand what causes these negativity spirals  and how they occur. And the results that they found I think are just incredibly impressively simple and interesting. So these equations  they predict how  the wife or husband is going to respond in their next turn of the conversation  how positive or negative they're going to be. And these equations  they depend on the mood of the person  when they're on their own  the mood of the person when they're with their partner  but most importantly  they depend on how much the husband and wife influence one another. Now  I think it's important  to point out at this stage  that these exact equations  have also been shown to be perfectly able at describing what happens between two countries in an arms race. So that    an arguing couple spiraling into negativity and teetering on the brink of divorce    is actually mathematically equivalent to the beginning of a nuclear war. But the really important term in this equation is the influence that people have on one another  and in particular  something called  the negativity threshold. Now  the negativity threshold  you can think of as how annoying the husband can be before the wife starts to get  really pissed off  and vice versa. Now  I always thought that good marriages were about compromise and understanding and allowing the person to  have the space to be themselves. So I would have thought that perhaps the most successful relationships were ones where there was a really high negativity threshold. Where couples let things go and only brought things up if  they really were a big deal. But actually  the mathematics and subsequent findings by the team have shown the exact opposite is true. The best couples  or the most successful couples  are the ones with a really low  negativity threshold. These are the couples that don't let anything go unnoticed and allow each other  some room to complain. These are the couples that are continually trying to repair their own relationship  that have a much more positive outlook on their marriage. Couples that don't let things go and couples that don't let trivial things end up being a really big deal. Now of course  it takes bit more than  just a low negativity threshold and not compromising to have a successful relationship. But I think that it's quite interesting to know that there is really mathematical evidence to say that you should never let the sun go down on your anger. So those are my top three tips of how maths can help you with love and relationships. But I hope that aside from their use as tips  they also give you a little bit of insight into the power of mathematics. Because for me  equations  and symbols aren't just a thing. They're a voice that speaks out about the incredible richness of nature and the startling simplicity in the patterns that twist and turn and warp and evolve all around us  from how the world works to how we behave. So I hope that perhaps  for just a couple of you  a little bit of insight into the mathematics of love can persuade you to have  a little bit more love for mathematics. Thank you. I grew up with my identical twin  who was an incredibly loving brother. Now  one thing about being a twin  is that it makes you an expert at spotting favoritism. If his cookie was even slightly bigger  than my cookie  I had questions. And clearly  I wasn't starving. When I became a psychologist  I began to notice favoritism of a different kind  and that is how much more we value the body than we do the mind. I spent nine years at university earning my doctorate in psychology  and I can't tell you how many people  look at my business card and say   Oh  a psychologist.  So not a real doctor   as if it should say that on my card. This favoritism we show the body  over the mind  I see it everywhere. I recently was at a friend's house  and their five year old was getting ready for bed. He was standing on a stool  by the sink brushing his teeth  when he slipped  and scratched his leg  on the stool when he fell. He cried for a minute   but then he got back up  got back on the stool  and reached out for a box of Band Aids to put one on his cut. Now  this kid could barely  tie his shoelaces  but he knew you have to cover a cut  so it doesn't become infected  and you have to care for your teeth by brushing twice a day. We all know how to maintain our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene  right  We've known it since we were five years old. But what do we know about maintaining our psychological health  Well  nothing. What do we teach our children about emotional hygiene  Nothing. How is it that we spend more time taking care of our teeth than we do our minds. Why is it that our physical health is so much more important to us than our psychological health  We sustain psychological injuries even more often than we do physical ones  injuries like failure or rejection or loneliness. And they can also get worse if we ignore them  and they can impact our lives in dramatic ways. And yet  even though there are  scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these kinds of psychological injuries  we don't. It doesn't even occur to us  that we should.  Oh  you're feeling depressed  Just shake it off  it's all in your head.  Can you imagine saying that to somebody with a broken leg   Oh  just walk it off  it's all in your leg.  It is time we closed the gap between our physical and our psychological health. It's time we made them more equal  more like twins. Speaking of which   my brother is also a psychologist. So he's not a real doctor  either. We didn't study together  though. In fact  the hardest thing  I've ever done in my life is move across the Atlantic  to New York City to get my doctorate in psychology. We were apart then for the first time in our lives  and the separation was  brutal for both of us. But while he remained among family and friends  I was alone in a new country. We missed each other terribly  but international phone calls were really expensive then and we could only afford to speak for five minutes a week. When our birthday rolled around  it was the first we wouldn't be spending together. We decide to splurge  and that week we would talk for    minutes. I spent the morning pacing around my room  waiting for him to call    and waiting and waiting   but the phone didn't ring. Given the time difference  I assumed   Ok  he's out with friends   he will call later.  There were no cell phones then. But he didn't. And I began to realize that after  being away for over    months  he no longer missed me  the way I missed him. I knew he would call in the morning  but that night was one of the saddest and longest nights of my life. I woke up the next morning. I glanced down at the phone  and  I realized I had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before. I stumbled out off bed  I put the phone back on the receiver  and it rang a second later  and it was my brother  and  boy  was he pissed. It was the saddest and longest  night of his life as well. Now I tried to explain what happened  but he said   I don't understand.  If you saw I wasn't calling you  why didn't you just pick up  the phone and call me   He was right. Why didn't I call him  I didn't have an answer then  but I do today  and it's a simple one  loneliness. Loneliness creates a deep psychological wound  one that distorts our perceptions and scrambles our thinking. It makes us believe that those around us care much less than they actually do. It make us really afraid to reach out  because why set yourself up for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching more than you can stand  I was in the grips of real  loneliness back then  but I was surrounded by people all day  so it never occurred to me. But loneliness is defined  purely subjectively. It depends solely on whether you feel emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you. And I did. There is a lot of research on loneliness  and all of it is horrifying. Loneliness won't just make you miserable  it will kill you. I'm not kidding. Chronic loneliness increases your  likelihood of an early death by    percent. Loneliness causes high blood pressure  high cholesterol. It even suppress the functioning of your immune system  making you vulnerable to all kinds  of illnesses and diseases. In fact  scientists have concluded  that taken together  chronic loneliness poses as  significant a risk for your longterm health and  longevity as cigarette smoking. Now cigarette packs come with warnings saying   This could kill you.  But loneliness doesn't. And that's why it's so important that we prioritize our psychological health  that we practice emotional hygiene. Because you can't treat  a psychological wound if you don't even know you're injured. Loneliness isn't the only  psychological wound that distorts our perceptions  and misleads us. Failure does that as well. I once visited a day care center  where I saw three toddlers play with identical plastic toys. You had to slide the red button  and a cute doggie would pop out. One little girl tried pulling the purple button  then pushing it  and then she just sat back and looked  at the box  with her lower lip trembling. The little boy next to her  watched this happen  then turned to his box and and burst  into tears without even touching it. Meanwhile  another little girl tried  everything she could think of until she slid the red button  the cute doggie popped out  and she squealed with delight. So three toddlers with  identical plastic toys  but with very different  reactions to failure. The first two toddlers were perfectly capable of sliding a red button. The only thing that prevented them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them into believing they could not. Now  adults get tricked this way  as well  all the time. In fact  we all have a default set of  feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever we encounter  frustrations and setbacks. Are you aware of how  your mind reacts to failure  You need to be. Because if your mind tries to convince you you're incapable of something and you believe it  then like those two toddlers  you'll begin to feel helpless and you'll stop trying too soon  or you won't even try at all. And then you'll be even more  convinced you can't succeed. You see  that's why so many people function below their actual potential. Because somewhere along the way   sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn't  succeed  and they believed it. Once we become convinced of something  it's very difficult to change our mind. I learned that lesson the hard way when I was a teenager with my brother. We were driving with friends  down a dark road at night  when a police car stopped us. There had been a robbery in the area and they were looking for suspects. The officer approached the car  and he shined his flashlight on the driver  then on my brother in the front seat  and then on me. And his eyes opened wide and he said   Where have I seen your face before   And I said   In the front seat.  But that made no sense to him whatsoever. So now he thought I was on drugs. So he drags me out of the car  he searches me  he marches me over to the police car  and only when he verified I didn't have a police record  could I show him  I had a twin in the front seat. But even as we were driving away   you could see by the look on his face he was convinced that I was getting away with something. Our mind is hard to change  once we become convinced. So it might be very natural to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail. But you cannot allow yourself to become  convinced you can't succeed. You have to fight  feelings of helplessness. You have to gain control over the situation. And you have to break this kind of  negative cycle before it begins. Our minds and our feelings  they're not the trustworthy friends we thought they were. They are more like a really moody friend  who can be totally supportive one minute  and really unpleasant the next. I once worked with this woman who after    years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce  was finally ready for her first date. She had met this guy online  and he seemed nice and he seemed successful  and most importantly   he seemed really into her. So she was very excited   she bought a new dress  and they met at an upscale New York City bar for a drink. Ten minutes into the date   the man stands up and says   I'm not interested   and walks out. Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move.  All she could do was call a friend. Here's what the friend said   Well  what do you expect  You have big hips  you have nothing interesting to say  why would a handsome   successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you   Shocking  right  that a friend  could be so cruel  But it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasn't  the friend who said that. It's what the woman said to herself. And that's something we all do   especially after a rejection. We all start thinking of all our faults and all our shortcomings  what we wish we were   what we wish we weren't  we call ourselves names. Maybe not as harshly  but we all do it. And it's interesting that we do  because our self esteem is already hurting. Why would we want to go  and damage it even further  We wouldn't make a physical injury  worse on purpose. You wouldn't get a cut on your arm  and decide   Oh  I know  I'm going to take a knife and see how much deeper I can make it.  But we do that with psychological injuries all the time. Why  Because of poor emotional hygiene. Because we don't prioritize  our psychological health. We know from dozens of studies that when your self esteem is lower  you are more vulnerable to  stress and to anxiety  that failures and rejections hurt more and it takes longer to recover from them. So when you get rejected   the first thing you should be doing is to revive your self esteem  not  join Fight Club and beat it into a pulp. When you're in emotional pain  treat yourself with the same compassion  you would expect from a truly good friend. We have to catch our unhealthy  psychological habits and change them. One of unhealthiest and most common is called rumination. To ruminate means to chew over. It's when your boss yells at you  or your  professor makes you feel stupid in class  or you have big fight with a friend and you just can't stop replaying the scene in your head for days  sometimes for weeks on end. Ruminating about upsetting events in this way can easily become a habit  and it's a very costly one. Because by spending so much time focused on upsetting and negative thoughts  you are actually putting yourself at significant risk for developing clinical depression   alcoholism  eating disorders  and even cardiovascular disease. The problem is the urge to ruminate can feel really strong and really important  so it's a difficult habit to stop. I know this for a fact   because a little over a year ago  I developed the habit myself. You see  my twin brother was diagnosed with stage III non Hodgkin's lymphoma. His cancer was extremly aggressive. He had visible tumors all over his body. And he had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy. And I couldn't stop thinking about  what he was going through. I couldn't stop thinking about  how much he was suffering  even though he never complained  not once. He had this incredibly positive attitude. His psychological health was amazing. I was physically healthy   but psychologically I was a mess. But I knew what to do. Studies tell us that even a two minute distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate in that moment. And so each time I had a worrying   upsetting  negative thought  I forced myself to concentrate on something else until the urge passed. And within one week   my whole outlook changed and became more positive  and more hopeful. Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy  my brother had a CAT scan  and I was by his side when  he got the results. All the tumors were gone. He still had three more rounds  of chemotherapy to go  but we knew he would recover. This picture was taken two weeks ago. By taking action when you're lonely  by changing your responses to failure  by protecting your self esteem  by battling negative thinking  you won't just heal your psychological wounds  you will build emotional resilience  you will thrive. A hundred years ago   people began practicing personal hygiene  and life expectancy rates rose  by over    percent in just a matter of decades. I believe our quality of life could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing  emotional hygiene. Can you imagine what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier  If there were less loneliness  and less depression  If people knew how to overcome failure  If they felt better about themselves and more empowered  If they were happier and more fulfilled  I can  because that's the world I want to live in  and that's the world my brother wants to live in as well. And if you just become informed and change a few simple habits  well  that's the world we can all live in. Thank you very much. In the mid '  s  the CDC and Kaiser Permanente discovered an exposure that dramatically increased the risk for seven out of    of the leading causes of death in the United States. In high doses  it affects brain development  the immune system  hormonal systems  and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed. Folks who are exposed in very high doses have triple the lifetime risk of heart disease and lung cancer and a    year difference in life expectancy. And yet  doctors today are not trained in routine screening or treatment. Now  the exposure I'm talking about is not a pesticide or a packaging chemical. It's childhood trauma. Okay. What kind of trauma am I talking about here  I'm not talking about failing a test or losing a basketball game. I am talking about threats that are so severe or pervasive that they literally get under our skin and change our physiology  things like abuse or neglect  or growing up with a parent  who struggles with mental illness or substance dependence. Now  for a long time  I viewed these things in the way  I was trained to view them  either as a social problem    refer to social services    or as a mental health problem    refer to mental health services. And then something happened to make me rethink my entire approach. When I finished my residency  I wanted to go someplace where I felt really needed  someplace where I could make a difference. So I came to work for California Pacific Medical Center  one of the best private hospitals in Northern California  and together  we opened a clinic in Bayview Hunters Point  one of the poorest  most underserved neighborhoods in San Francisco. Now  prior to that point  there had been only one pediatrician in all of Bayview to serve more than        children  so we hung a shingle  and we were able to provide top quality care regardless of ability to pay. It was so cool. We targeted the typical health disparities  access to care  immunization rates  asthma hospitalization rates  and we hit all of our numbers. We felt very proud of ourselves. But then I started noticing a disturbing trend. A lot of kids were being referred to me for ADHD  or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder  but when I actually did a thorough history and physical  what I found was that for most of my patients  I couldn't make a diagnosis of ADHD. Most of the kids I was seeing had experienced such severe trauma that it felt like something else was going on. Somehow I was missing something important. Now  before I did my residency  I did a master's degree in public health  and one of the things that they teach you in public health school is that if you're a doctor and you see     kids that all drink from the same well  and    of them develop diarrhea  you can go ahead and write that prescription for dose after dose after dose of antibiotics  or you can walk over and say   What the hell is in this well   So I began reading everything that I could get my hands on about how exposure to adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children. And then one day  my colleague walked into my office  and he said   Dr. Burke  have you seen this   In his hand was a copy of a research study called the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study. That day changed my clinical practice and ultimately my career. The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study is something that everybody needs to know about. It was done by Dr. Vince Felitti at Kaiser and Dr. Bob Anda at the CDC  and together  they asked        adults about their history of exposure to what they called  adverse  childhood experiences   or ACEs. Those include physical  emotional  or sexual abuse  physical or emotional neglect  parental mental illness  substance dependence  incarceration  parental separation or divorce  or domestic violence. For every yes  you would get a point on your ACE score. And then what they did was they correlated these ACE scores against health outcomes. What they found was striking. Two things  Number one  ACEs are incredibly common. Sixty seven percent of the population had at least one ACE  and   .  percent  one in eight  had four or more ACEs. The second thing that they found was that there was a dose response relationship between ACEs and health outcomes  the higher your ACE score  the worse your health outcomes. For a person with an ACE score of four or more  their relative risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was two and a half times that of someone with an ACE score of zero. For hepatitis  it was also two and a half times. For depression  it was four and a half times. For suicidality  it was    times. A person with an ACE score of seven or more had triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer and three and a half times the risk of ischemic heart disease  the number one killer in the United States of America. Well  of course this makes sense. Some people looked at this data and they said   Come on. You have a rough childhood  you're more likely to drink and smoke and do all these things that are going to ruin your health. This isn't science. This is just bad behavior.  It turns out this is exactly where the science comes in. We now understand better than we ever have before how exposure to early adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children. It affects areas like the nucleus accumbens  the pleasure and reward center of the brain that is implicated in substance dependence. It inhibits the prefrontal cortex  which is necessary for impulse control and executive function  a critical area for learning. And on MRI scans  we see measurable differences in the amygdala  the brain's fear response center. So there are real neurologic reasons why folks exposed to high doses of adversity are more likely to engage in high risk behavior  and that's important to know. But it turns out that even if you don't engage in any high risk behavior  you're still more likely to develop heart disease or cancer. The reason for this has to do with the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis  the brain's and body's stress response system that governs our fight or flight response. How does it work  Well  imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear. Immediately  your hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary  which sends a signal  to your adrenal gland that says   Release stress hormones  Adrenaline  Cortisol   And so your heart starts to pound  Your pupils dilate  your airways open up  and you are ready to either fight that bear or run from the bear. And that is wonderful if you're in a forest and there's a bear. But the problem is what happens when the bear comes home every night  and this system is activated over and over and over again  and it goes from being adaptive  or life saving  to maladaptive  or health damaging. Children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation  because their brains and bodies are just developing. High doses of adversity not only affect brain structure and function  they affect the developing immune system  developing hormonal systems  and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed. So for me  this information threw my old training out the window  because when we understand the mechanism of a disease  when we know not only which pathways are disrupted  but how  then as doctors  it is our job to use this science for prevention and treatment. That's what we do. So in San Francisco  we created the Center for Youth Wellness to prevent  screen and heal the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress. We started simply with routine screening of every one of our kids at their regular physical  because I know that if my patient  has an ACE score of    she's two and a half times as likely to develop hepatitis or COPD  she's four and half times as likely to become depressed  and she's    times as likely to attempt to take her own life as my patient with zero ACEs. I know that when she's in my exam room. For our patients who do screen positive  we have a multidisciplinary treatment team that works to reduce the dose of adversity and treat symptoms using best practices  including home visits  care coordination  mental health care  nutrition  holistic interventions  and yes  medication when necessary. But we also educate parents about the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress the same way you would for covering electrical outlets  or lead poisoning  and we tailor the care of our asthmatics and our diabetics in a way that recognizes that they may need more aggressive treatment  given the changes to their hormonal and immune systems. So the other thing that happens when you understand this science is that you want to shout it from the rooftops  because this isn't just an issue for kids in Bayview. I figured the minute that everybody else heard about this  it would be routine screening  multi disciplinary treatment teams  and it would be a race to the most effective clinical treatment protocols. Yeah. That did not happen. And that was a huge learning for me. What I had thought of as simply best clinical practice I now understand to be a movement. In the words of Dr. Robert Block  the former President of the American Academy of Pediatrics   Adverse childhood experiences are the single greatest unaddressed public health threat facing our nation today.  And for a lot of people  that's a terrifying prospect. The scope and scale of the problem seems so large that it feels overwhelming to think about how we might approach it. But for me  that's actually where the hopes lies  because when we have the right framework  when we recognize this to be a public health crisis  then we can begin to use the right  tool kit to come up with solutions. From tobacco to lead poisoning  to HIV AIDS  the United States actually has quite a strong track record with addressing public health problems  but replicating those successes with ACEs and toxic stress is going to take determination and commitment  and when I look at what our nation's response has been so far  I wonder  why haven't we taken this more seriously  You know  at first I thought that we marginalized the issue because it doesn't apply to us. That's an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods. Which is weird  because the data doesn't bear that out. The original ACEs study was done in a population that was    percent Caucasian     percent college educated. But then  the more I talked to folks  I'm beginning to think that maybe I had it completely backwards. If I were to ask how many people in this room grew up with a family member who suffered from mental illness  I bet a few hands would go up. And then if I were to ask how many folks had a parent who maybe drank too much  or who really believed that if you spare the rod  you spoil the child  I bet a few more hands would go up. Even in this room  this is an issue that touches many of us  and I am beginning to believe that we marginalize the issue because it does apply to us. Maybe it's easier to see in other zip codes because we don't want to look at it. We'd rather be sick. Fortunately  scientific advances and  frankly  economic realities make that option less viable every day. The science is clear  Early adversity dramatically affects health across a lifetime. Today  we are beginning to understand how to interrupt the progression from early adversity to disease and early death  and    years from now  the child who has a high ACE score and whose behavioral symptoms go unrecognized  whose asthma management is not connected  and who goes on to develop high blood pressure and early heart disease or cancer will be just as anomalous as a six month mortality from HIV AIDS. People will look at that situation and say   What the heck happened there   This is treatable. This is beatable. The single most important thing that we need today is the courage to look this problem in the face and say  this is real and this is all of us. I believe that we are the movement. Thank you. As an Arab female photographer  I have always found ample inspiration for my projects in personal experiences. The passion I developed for knowledge  which allowed me to break barriers towards a better life was the motivation  for my project I Read I Write. Pushed by my own experience  as I was not allowed initially to pursue my higher education  I decided to explore and document stories of other women who changed their lives through education  while exposing and questioning the barriers they face. I covered a range of topics that concern women's education  keeping in mind the differences among Arab countries due to economic and social factors. These issues include female illiteracy  which is quite high in the region  educational reforms  programs for dropout students  and political activism among university students. As I started this work  it was not always easy  to convince the women to participate. Only after explaining to them how their stories might influence other women's lives  how they would become role models for their own community  did some agree. Seeking a collaborative and reflexive approach  I asked them to write their own words and ideas on prints of their own images. Those images were then shared in some of the classrooms  and worked to inspire and motivate other women going through similar educations  and situations. Aisha  a teacher from Yemen  wrote   I sought education in order to be independent and to not count on men with everything.  One of my first subjects was Umm El Saad from Egypt. When we first met  she was barely able to write her name. She was attending a nine month literacy program run by a local NGO in the Cairo suburbs. Months later  she was joking that her husband had threatened to pull her out of the classes  as he found out that his now literate wife was going through his phone text messages. Naughty Umm El Saad. Of course  that's not why Umm El Saad joined the program. I saw how she was longing to gain control over her simple daily routines  small details that we take for granted  from counting money at the market to helping her kids in homework. Despite her poverty and her community's mindset  which belittles women's education  Umm El Saad  along with her Egyptian classmates  was eager to learn how to read and write. In Tunisia  I met Asma  one of the four activist women I interviewed. The secular bioengineering student is quite active on social media. Regarding her country  which treasured what has been called the Arab Spring  she said   I've always dreamt of discovering a new bacteria. Now  after the revolution  we have a new one every single day.  Asma was referring to the rise of religious fundamentalism in the region  which is another obstacle to women in particular. Out of all the women I met  Fayza from Yemen affected me the most. Fayza was forced to drop out of school at the age of eight when she was married. That marriage lasted for a year. At     she became the third wife of a    year old man  and by the time she was     she was a divorced mother of three. Despite her poverty  despite her social status as a divorc e in an ultra conservative society  and despite the opposition of her parents to her going back to school  Fayza knew that her only way to control her life was through education. She is now   . She received a grant from a local NGO to fund her business studies at the university. Her goal is to find a job  rent a place to live in  and bring her kids back with her. The Arab states are going through tremendous change  and the struggles women face are overwhelming. Just like the women I photographed  I had to overcome many barriers to becoming the photographer I am today  many people along the way telling me what I can and cannot do. Umm El Saad  Asma and Fayza  and many women across the Arab world  show that it is possible to overcome barriers to education  which they know is the best means to a better future. And here I would like to end with a quote by Yasmine  one of the four activist women I interviewed in Tunisia. Yasmine wrote   Question your convictions. Be who you to want to be  not who they want you to be. Don't accept their enslavement  for your mother birthed you free.  Thank you. I am multidisciplinary. As a scientist  I've been a crew commander for a NASA Mars simulation last year  and as an artist  I create multicultural community art all over the planet. And recently  I've actually been combining both. But let me first talk a little more about that NASA mission. This is the HI SEAS program. HI SEAS is a NASA funded planetary surface analogue on the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii  and it's a research program that is specifically designed to study the effects of long term isolation of small crews. I lived in this dome for four months with a crew of six  a very interesting experience  of course. We did all kinds of research. Our main research was actually a food study  but apart from that food study    developing a new food system for astronauts living in deep space    we also did all kinds of other research. We did extra vehicular activities  as you can see here  wearing mock up space suits  but we also had our chores and lots of other stuff to do  like questionnaires at the end of every day. Busy  busy work. Now  as you can imagine  it's quite challenging to live with just a small group of people in a small space for a long time. There's all kinds of psychological challenges  how to keep a team together in these circumstances  how to deal with the warping of time you start to sense when you're living in these circumstances  sleep problems that arise  etc. But also we learned a lot. I learned a lot about how individual crew members actually cope with a situation like this  how you can keep a crew productive and happy  for example  giving them a good deal of autonomy is a good trick to do that  and honestly  I learned a lot about leadership  because I was a crew commander. So doing this mission  I really started thinking more deeply about our future in outer space. We will venture into outer space  and we will start inhabiting outer space. I have no doubt about it. It might take    years or it might take     years  but it's going to happen nevertheless. So I came up with a new art project called Seeker. And the Seeker project is actually challenging communities all over the world to come up with starship prototypes that re envision human habitation and survival. That's the core of the project. Now  one important thing  This is not a dystopian project. This is not about   Oh my God  the world is going wrong and we have to escape because we need another future somewhere else.  No  no. The project is basically inviting people to take a step away from earthbound constraints and  as such  reimagine our future. And it's really helpful  and it works really well  so that's really the important part of what we're doing. Now  in this project  I'm using a cocreation approach  which is a slightly different approach from what you would expect from many artists. I'm essentially dropping a basic idea into a group  into a community  people start gravitating to the idea  and together  we shape  and build the artwork. It's a little bit like termites  really. We just work together  and even  for example  when architects visit what we're doing  sometimes they have a bit of a hard time understanding how we build without a master plan. We always come up with these fantastic large scale scupltures that actually we can also inhabit. The first version was done in Belgium and Holland. It was built with a team of almost    people. This is the second iteration of that same project  but in Slovenia  in a different country  and the new group was like  we're going  to do the architecture differently. So they took away the architecture  they kept the base of the artwork  and they built an entirely new  much more biomorphic architecture on top of that. And that's another crucial part of the project. It's an evolving artwork  evolving architecture. This was the last version that was just presented a few weeks ago in Holland  which was using caravans  as modules to build a starship. We bought some second hand caravans  cut them open  and reassembled them into a starship. Now  when we're thinking about starships  we're not just approaching it as a technological challenge. We're really looking at it as a combination of three systems  ecology  people and technology. So there's always a strong ecological component in the project. Here you can see aquaponic systems that are actually surrounding the astronauts  so they're constantly in contact with part of the food that they're eating. Now  a very typical thing for this project is that we run our own isolation missions inside these art and design projects. We actually lock ourselves up for multiple days on end  and test what we build. And this is  for example  on the right hand side you can see an isolation mission in the Museum of Modern Art in Ljubljana in Slovenia  where six artists and designers locked themselves up    I was part of that    for four days inside the museum. And  of course  obviously  this is a very performative and very strong experience for all of us. Now  the next version of the project is currently being developed together with Camilo Rodriguez Beltran  who is also a TED Fellow  in the Atacama Desert in Chile  a magical place. First of all  it's really considered a Mars analogue. It really does look like Mars in certain locations and has been used by NASA to test equipment. And it has a long history of being connected to space through observations of the stars. It's now home to ALMA  the large telescope that's being developed there. But also  it's the driest location on the planet  and that makes it extremely interesting to build our project  because suddenly  sustainability is something we have to explore fully. We have no other option  so I'm very curious to see what's going to happen. Now  a specific thing for this particular version of the project is that I'm very interested to see how we can connect with the local population  the native population. These people have been living there for a very long time and can be considered experts in sustainability  and so I'm very interested to see what we can learn from them  and have an input of indigenous knowledge into space exploration. So we're trying to redefine how we look at our future in outer space by exploring integration  biology  technology and people  by using a cocreation approach  and by using and exploring local traditions and to see how we can learn from the past and integrate that into our deep future. Thank you. An    year old  African American male joined the United States Air Force and was assigned to Mountain Home  Air Force Base and was a part of the air police squadron. Upon first arriving there  the first goal that I had was for me to identify an apartment  so I could bring my wife  and my new baby  Melanie  out to join me in Idaho. I immediately went to  the personnel office  and talking with the guys in personnel  they said   Hey  no problem finding  an apartment in Mountain Home  Idaho. The people down there love us  because they know if they have an airman who is coming in to rent  one of their apartments  they'll always get their money.  And that was a really important thing. He said   So here is a list  of people that you can call  and then they will then allow you  to select the apartment that you want.  So I got the list  I made the call. The lady answered on the other end and I told her what I wanted. She said   Oh  great you called. We have four or five apartments available right now.  She said   Do you want  a one bedroom or two bedroom   Then she said   Let's not talk about that. Just come on down   select the apartment that you want. We'll sign the contract and you'll have keys in your hand to get your family out here right away.  So I was excited. I jumped in my car. I went downtown and knocked on the door. When I knocked on the door   the woman came to the door  and she looked at me  and she said   Can I help you   I said   Yes  I'm the person  who called about the apartments. I was just coming down  to make my selection.  She said   You know what   I'm really sorry  but my husband rented those apartments and didn't tell me about them.  I said   You mean he rented  all five of them in one hour   She didn't give me a response  and what she said was this  She said   Why don't you leave your number  and if we have some openings   I'll give you a call   Needless to say  I did not get a call from her. Nor did I get any responses  from the other people that they gave me on the list where I could get apartments. So as a result of that  and feeling rejected  I went back to the base  and I talked to the squadron commander. His name was McDow  Major McDow. I said   Major McDow  I need your help.  I told him what happened   and here's what he said to me  He said   James  I would love to help you. But you know the problem  We can't make people rent to folks  that they don't want to rent to. And besides  we have a great relationship with people in the community and we really don't want to damage that.  He said   So maybe this is  what you should do. Why don't you let your family stay home  because you do know  that you get a    day leave. So once a year  you can go home to your family  spend    days and then come on back.  Needless to say  that didn't resonate for me. So after leaving him   I went back to personnel  and talking to the clerk  he said   Jim  I think I have a  solution for you. There's an airman who is leaving and he has a trailer. If you noticed  in Mountain Home  there are trailer parks and trailers all over the place. You can buy his trailer  and you'd probably get a really good deal because he wants to get out of town as soon as possible. And that would take care of your problem  and that would provide  the solution for you.  So I immediately jumped in my car  went downtown  saw the trailer    it was a small trailer  but under the circumstances  I figured that was the  best thing that I could do. So I bought the trailer. And then I asked him    Can I just leave the trailer here  and that would take care  of all my problems  I wouldn't have to find another trailer park   He said   Before I say yes to that   I need to check with management.  So I get back to the base  he called me back and management said   No  you can't leave the trailer here because we had promised that slot to some other people.  And that was strange to me because there were several  other slots that were open  but it just so happened that he  had promised that slot to someone else. So  what I did    and he said   You shouldn't worry  Jim  because there are a lot of trailer parks.  So I put out another exhaustive list of going to trailer parks. I went to one after another   after another. And I got the same kind of rejection there that I received when I was looking  for the apartment. And as a result  the kind of comments that they made to me  in addition to saying that they didn't have any slots open  one person said   Jim  the reason why we can't rent to you  we already have a Negro family in the trailer park.  He said   And it's not me   because I like you people.  And that's what I did  too. I chuckled  too. He said   But here's the problem  If I let you in  the other tenants  will move out and I can't afford to take that kind of a hit.  He said   I just can't rent to you.  Even though that was discouraging  it didn't stop me. I kept looking  and I looked at the far end  of the town in Mountain Home  and there was a small trailer park. I mean  a really small trailer park. It didn't have any paved roads in it  it didn't have the concrete slabs  it didn't have fencing to portion off your trailer slot  from other trailer slots. It didn't have a laundry facility. But the conclusion I reached  at that moment was that I didn't have  a lot of other options. So I called my wife  and I said   We're going to make this one work.  And we moved into it and we became homeowners in Mountain Home  Idaho. And of course  eventually things settled down. Four years after that  I received papers to move from Mountain Home  Idaho to a place called Goose Bay  Labrador. We won't even talk about that. It was another great location.  Laughter  So my challenge then was to get my family  from Mountain Home  Idaho to Sharon  Pennsylvania. That wasn't a problem because we had just purchased a brand new automobile. My mother called  and said she'll fly out. She'll be with us as we drive  she'll help us manage the children. So she came out  her and Alice  put a lot of food together for the trip. That morning  we left at about   a.m. Great trip  having a great time   good conversation. Somewhere around         o'clock  we got a little bit tired  and we said   Why don't we get a motel so that we can rest and then have an early start in the morning   So we were looking at a number  of the motels as we drove down the road  and we saw one  it was a great big  bright flashing light that said   Vacancies  Vacancies  Vacanies.  So we stopped in. They were in the parking lot   I went inside. When I walked inside  the lady was just finishing up  one contract with some folks  some other people  were coming in behind me. And so I walked to the counter  and she said   How can I help you   I said   I would like to get a motel  for the evening for my family.  She said   You know  I'm really sorry  I just rented the last one. We will not have any more  until the morning.  She said   But if you go down the road about an hour     minutes  there's another trailer park down there.  I said   Yeah  but you still have the  'Vacancies' light on  and it's flashing.  She said   Oh  I forgot.  And she reached over  and turned the light off. She looked at me and I looked at her. There were other people in the room. She kind of looked at them. No one said anything. So I just got the hint and I left  and went outside to the parking lot. And I told my mother and I told my wife and also Melanie  and I said   It looks like we're going to have to drive a little bit further down the road to be able to sleep tonight.  And we did drive down the road  but just before we took off  and pulled out of the parking lot  guess what happened  The light came back on. And it said   Vacancies   Vacancies  Vacancies.  We were able to find a nice place. It wasn't our preference  but it was secure and it was clean. And so we had a great sleep that night. The piece that's important about that is that we had similar kinds of experiences from Idaho all the way through  to Pennsylvania  where we were rejected from hotels   motels and restaurants. But we made it to Pennsylvania. We got the family settled. Everyone was glad to see the kids. I jumped on a plane and shot off to Goose Bay  Labrador  which is another story  right  Here it is     years later  I now have nine grandchildren   two great grandchildren. Five of the grandchildren are boys. I have master's  Ph.D.  undergrad  one in medical school. I have a couple that are trending. They're almost there but not quite.  Laughter  I have one who has been  in college now for eight years. He doesn't have a degree yet   but he wants to be a comedian. So we're just trying to get him to stay in school. Because you never know  just because you're funny at home  does not make you a comedian  right  But the thing about it   they're all good kids    no drugs  no babies  in high school  no crime. So with that being the backdrop  I was sitting in my TV room watching TV  and they were talking about Ferguson and all the hullabaloo that was going on. And all of a sudden  one of the news  commentators got on the air and she said   In the last three months  eight unarmed African American males have been killed by police  white homeowners  or white citizens.  For some reason  at that moment it just all hit me. I said   What is it  It is so insane. What is the hatred that's causing people  to do these kinds of things   Just then  one of my grandsons called. He said   Granddad  did you hear what they said on TV   I said   Yes  I did.  He said   I'm just so confused. We do everything we do  but it seems that driving while black  walking while black  talking while black  it's just dangerous. What can we do  We do everything that you told us to do. When stopped by the police  we place both hands on the steering wheel at the    o'clock position. If asked to get identification  we tell them  'I am slowly reaching over  into the glove compartment to get my I.D.' When pulled out of the car to be searched  when laid on the ground to be searched  when our trunks are opened to be searched  we don't push back  we don't challenge because we know  you've told us  'Don't you challenge the police. After it's over  call us and we'll be the ones to challenge.  He said   And this is the piece  that really bugs me  Our white friends  our buddies  we kind of hang together. When they hear about these kinds of things happening to us  they say  'Why do you take it  You need to push back. You need to challenge. You need to ask them  for their identification.'  And here's what the boys have been taught to tell them   We know that you can do that  but please do not do that while we're in the car because the consequences for you are significantly different than the consequences for us.  And so as a grandparent   what do I tell my grandsons  How do I keep them safe  How do I keep them alive  As a result of this  people have come to me and said   Jim  are you angry   And my response to that is this   I don't have the luxury of being angry  and I also know the consequences  of being enraged.  So therefore  the only thing that I can do is take my collective intellect and my energy and my ideas and my experiences and dedicate myself to challenge   at any point in time  anything that looks  like it might be racist. So the first thing I have  to do is to educate  the second thing I have to do  is to unveil racism  and the last thing I need to do is do everything within my power to eradicate racism in my lifetime by any means necessary. The second thing I do is this  I want to appeal to Americans. I want to appeal to their humanity  to their dignity  to their civic pride and ownership to be able to not react to these  heinous crimes in an adverse manner. But instead  to elevate your level of societal knowledge  your level of societal awareness and societal consciousness to then collectively come together  all of us come together  to make sure that we speak out against and we challenge any kind of insanity  any kind of insanity that makes it  okay to kill unarmed people  regardless of their ethnicity  regardless of their race  regardless of their diversity makeup. We have to challenge that. It doesn't make any sense. The only way I think we can do that is through a collective. We need to have black and white  and Asian and Hispanic just to step forward and say   We are not going to accept  that kind of behavior anymore.  We humans have always been very concerned about the health of our bodies  but we haven't always been that good at figuring out what's important. Take the ancient Egyptians  for example  very concerned about the body parts they thought they'd need in the afterlife  but they left some parts out. This part  for example. Although they very carefully  preserved the stomach  the lungs  the liver  and so forth  they just mushed up the brain  drained it out through the nose  and threw it away  which makes sense  really  because what does a brain do for us anyway  But imagine if there were a kind of neglected organ in our bodies that weighed just as much as the brain and in some ways was just as important to who we are  but we knew so little about and treated with such disregard. And imagine if  through new scientific advances  we were just beginning to understand its importance to how we think of ourselves. Wouldn't you want to know more about it  Well  it turns out that we do have something just like that  our gut  or rather  its microbes. But it's not just the microbes in our gut that are important. Microbes all over our body turn out to be really critical to a whole range of differences that make different people who we are. So for example  have you ever noticed how some people get bitten by mosquitos way more often than others  It turns out that everyone's anecdotal experience out camping is actually true. For example  I seldom get bitten by mosquitos  but my partner Amanda attracts them in droves  and the reason why is that we have different microbes on our skin that produce different chemicals that the mosquitos detect. Now  microbes are also really important in the field of medicine. So  for example  what microbes you have in your gut determine whether particular painkillers are toxic to your liver. They also determine whether or not other drugs will work for your heart condition. And  if you're a fruit fly  at least  your microbes determine who you want to have sex with. We haven't demonstrated this in humans yet but maybe it's just a matter of time before we find out.  Laughter  So microbes are performing a huge range of functions. They help us digest our food. They help educate our immune system. They help us resist disease  and they may even be affecting our behavior. So what would a map of all these microbial communities look like  Well  it wouldn't look exactly like this  but it's a helpful guide for understanding biodiversity. Different parts of the world have different landscapes of organisms that are immediately characteristic of one place or another or another. With microbiology  it's kind of the same  although I've got to be honest with you  All the microbes essentially look the same under a microscope. So instead of trying to identify them visually  what we do is we look at their DNA sequences  and in a project called the Human Microbiome Project  NIH funded this      million project where hundreds  of researchers came together to map out all the A's  T's  G's  and C's  and all of these microbes in the human body. So when we take them together  they look like this. It's a bit more difficult to tell who lives where now  isn't it  What my lab does is develop computational techniques that allow us to take all these terabytes of sequence data and turn them into something that's a bit more useful as a map  and so when we do that with the human microbiome data from     healthy volunteers  it looks like this. Each point here represents all the complex microbes in an entire microbial community. See  I told you they basically all look the same. So what we're looking at is each point represents one microbial community from one body site of one healthy volunteer. And so you can see that there's different parts of the map in different colors  almost like separate continents. And what it turns out to be is that those  as the different regions of the body  have very different microbes in them. So what we have is we have the oral community up there in green. Over on the other side  we have the skin community in blue  the vaginal community in purple  and then right down at the bottom  we have the fecal community in brown. And we've just over the last few years found out that the microbes in different parts of the body are amazingly different from one another. So if I look at just one person's microbes in the mouth and in the gut  it turns out that the difference between those two microbial communities is enormous. It's bigger than the difference between the microbes in this reef and the microbes in this prairie. So this is incredible when you think about it. What it means is that a few feet of difference in the human body makes more of a difference to your microbial ecology than hundreds of miles on Earth. And this is not to say that two people  look basically the same in the same body habitat  either. So you probably heard that we're pretty much all the same in terms of our human DNA. You're   .   percent identical in terms of your human DNA to the person sitting next to you. But that's not true of your gut microbes  you might only share    percent similarity with the person sitting next to you in terms of your gut microbes. So that's as different as the bacteria on this prairie and the bacteria in this forest. So these different microbes have all these different kinds  of functions that I told you about  everything from digesting food to involvement in different kinds of diseases  metabolizing drugs  and so forth. So how do they do all this stuff  Well  in part it's because although there's just three pounds of those microbes in our gut  they really outnumber us. And so how much do they outnumber us  Well  it depends on what you think of as our bodies. Is it our cells  Well  each of us consists of about    trillion human cells  but we harbor as many as     trillion microbial cells. So they outnumber us    to one. Now  you might think  well  we're human because of our DNA  but it turns out that each of us has about        human genes  depending on what you count exactly  but as many as two million to    million microbial genes. So whichever way we look at it  we're vastly outnumbered by our microbial symbionts. And it turns out that in addition  to traces of our human DNA  we also leave traces of our microbial DNA on everything we touch. We showed in a study a few years ago that you can actually match the palm of someone's hand up to the computer mouse that they use routinely with up to    percent accuracy. So this came out in a scientific journal a few years ago  but more importantly  it was featured on  CSI  Miami   so you really know it's true. So where do our microbes come from in the first place  Well if  as I do  you have dogs or kids  you probably have some dark suspicions about that  all of which are true  by the way. So just like we can match you to your computer equipment by the microbes you share  we can also match you up to your dog. But it turns out that in adults  microbial communities are relatively stable  so even if you live together with someone  you'll maintain your separate microbial identity over a period of weeks  months  even years. It turns out that our first microbial communities depend a lot on how we're born. So babies that come out the regular way  all of their microbes are basically like the vaginal community  whereas babies that are delivered by C section  all of their microbes instead look like skin. And this might be associated with some of the differences in health associated with Cesarean birth  such as more asthma  more allergies  even more obesity  all of which have been linked to microbes now  and when you think about it  until recently  every surviving mammal had been delivered by the birth canal  and so the lack of those protective microbes that we've co evolved with might be really important for a lot of these different conditions that we now know involve the microbiome. When my own daughter was born a couple of years ago by emergency C section  we took matters into our own hands and made sure she was coated with those vaginal microbes that she would have gotten naturally. Now  it's really difficult to tell whether this has had an effect on her health specifically  right  With a sample size of just one child  no matter how much we love her  you don't really have enough of a sample size to figure out what happens on average  but at two years old  she hasn't had an ear infection yet  so we're keeping our fingers crossed on that one. And what's more  we're starting to do clinical trials with more children to figure out whether this has a protective effect generally. So how we're born has a tremendous effect on what microbes we have initially  but where do we go after that  What I'm showing you again here is this map of the Human Microbiome Project Data  so each point represents a sample from one body site from one of     healthy adults. And you've seen children develop physically. You've seen them develop mentally. Now  for the first time  you're going to see one of my colleague's children develop microbially. So what we are going to look at is we're going to look  at this one baby's stool  the fecal community  which represents the gut  sampled every week for almost two and a half years. And so we're starting on day one. What's going to happen is that the infant is going to start off as this yellow dot  and you can see that he's starting off basically in the vaginal community  as we would expect from his delivery mode. And what's going to happen over these two and a half years is that he's going to travel  all the way down to resemble the adult fecal community from healthy volunteers down at the bottom. So I'm just going to start this going and we'll see how that happens. What you can see  and remember each step in this is just one week  what you can see is that week to week  the change in the microbial community of the feces of this one child  the differences week to week are much greater than the differences between individual healthy adults in the Human Microbiome Project cohort  which are those brown dots down at the bottom. And you can see he's starting to approach the adult fecal community. This is up to about two years. But something amazing is about to happen here. So he's getting antibiotics for an ear infection. What you can see is this huge change in the community  followed by a relatively rapid recovery. I'll just rewind that for you. And what we can see is that just over these few weeks  we have a much more radical change  a setback of many months  of normal development  followed by a relatively rapid recovery  and by the time he reaches day      which is the end of this video  you can see that he has essentially reached the healthy adult stool community  despite that antibiotic intervention. So this is really interesting because it raises fundamental questions about what happens when we intervene at different ages in a child's life. So does what we do early on  where the microbiome is changing so rapidly  actually matter  or is it like throwing a stone into a stormy sea  where the ripples will just be lost  Well  fascinatingly  it turns out that if you give children antibiotics in the first six months of life  they're more likely to become obese later on than if they don't get antibiotics then or only get them later  and so what we do early on may have profound impacts on the gut microbial community and on later health that we're only beginning to understand. So this is fascinating  because one day  in addition to the effects that antibiotics have on antibiotic resistant bacteria  which are very important  they may also be degrading our gut microbial ecosystems  and so one day we may come to regard antibiotics with the same horror that we currently reserve for those metal tools that the Egyptians used to use to mush up the brains before they drained them out for embalming. So I mentioned that microbes have all these important functions  and they've also now  just over the past few years  been connected to a whole range of different diseases  including inflammatory bowel disease  heart disease  colon cancer  and even obesity. Obesity has a really  large effect  as it turns out  and today  we can tell whether you're lean or obese with    percent accuracy by looking at the microbes in your gut. Now  although that might sound impressive  in some ways it's a little bit problematic as a medical test  because you can probably tell which of these people is obese without knowing anything about their gut microbes  but it turns out that even if we sequence their complete genomes and had all their human DNA  we could only predict which one was obese with about    percent accuracy. So that's amazing  right  What it means that the three pounds of microbes that you carry around with you may be more important for some health conditions than every single gene in your genome. And then in mice  we can do a lot more. So in mice  microbes have been linked to all kinds of additional conditions  including things like multiple sclerosis  depression  autism  and again  obesity. But how can we tell whether these microbial differences that correlate with disease are cause or effect  Well  one thing we can do is we can raise some mice without any microbes of their own in a germ free bubble. Then we can add in some microbes that we think are important  and see what happens. When we take the microbes from an obese mouse and transplant them into a genetically normal mouse that's been raised in a bubble with no microbes of its own  it becomes fatter than if it got them  from a regular mouse. Why this happens is absolutely amazing  though. Sometimes what's going on is that the microbes are helping them digest food more efficiently from the same diet  so they're taking more energy from their food  but other times  the microbes are actually affecting their behavior. What they're doing is they're eating more than the normal mouse  so they only get fat if we let them  eat as much as they want. So this is really remarkable  right  The implication is that microbes can affect mammalian behavior. So you might be wondering whether we can  also do this sort of thing across species  and it turns out that if you take microbes from an obese person and transplant them into mice you've raised germ free  those mice will also become fatter than if they received the microbes from a lean person  but we can design a microbial community that we inoculate them with that prevents them from gaining this weight. We can also do this for malnutrition. So in a project funded by the Gates Foundation  what we're looking at is children in Malawi who have kwashiorkor  a profound form of malnutrition  and mice that get the kwashiorkor community transplanted into them lose    percent of their body mass in just three weeks  but we can restore their health by using  the same peanut butter based supplement that is used for  the children in the clinic  and the mice that receive the community from the healthy identical twins of the kwashiorkor children do fine. This is truly amazing because it suggests that we can pilot therapies by trying them out in a whole bunch of different mice with individual people's gut communities and perhaps tailor those therapies all the way down to the individual level. So I think it's really important that everyone has a chance to participate in this discovery. So  a couple of years ago  we started this project called American Gut  which allows you to claim a place  for yourself on this microbial map. This is now the largest crowd funded science project that we know of    over       people have signed up at this point. What happens is  they send in their samples  we sequence the DNA of their microbes and then release the results back to them. We also release them  de identified  to scientists  to educators  to interested members of the general public  and so forth  so anyone can have access to the data. On the other hand  when we do tours of our lab at the BioFrontiers Institute  and we explain that we use robots and lasers to look at poop  it turns out that not everyone wants to know. But I'm guessing that many of you do  and so I brought some kits here if you're interested in trying this out for yourself. So why might we want to do this  Well  it turns out that microbes are not just important for finding out where we are in terms of our health  but they can actually cure disease. This is one of the newest things we've been able to visualize with colleagues  at the University of Minnesota. So here's that map of the human microbiome again. What we're looking at now    I'm going to add in the community of some people with C. diff. So  this is a terrible form of diarrhea where you have to go up to    times a day  and these people have failed antibiotic therapy for two years before they're eligible for this trial. So what would happen if we transplanted some of the stool from a healthy donor  that star down at the bottom  into these patients. Would the good microbes do battle with the bad microbes and help to restore their health  So let's watch exactly what happens there. Four of those patients are about to get a transplant from that healthy donor at the bottom  and what you can see is that immediately  you have this radical change in the gut community. So one day after you do that transplant  all those symptoms clear up  the diarrhea vanishes  and they're essentially healthy again  coming to resemble the donor's community  and they stay there. So we're just at the beginning of this discovery. We're just finding out that microbes have implications for all these different kinds of diseases  ranging from inflammatory  bowel disease to obesity  and perhaps even autism and depression. What we need to do  though  is we need to develop a kind of microbial GPS  where we don't just know where we are currently but also where we want to go and what we need to do in order to get there  and we need to be able to make this simple enough that even a child can use it.  Laughter  Thank you. While preparing for my talk I was reflecting on my life and trying to figure out where exactly was that moment when my journey began. A long time passed by  and I simply couldn't figure out the beginning or the middle or the end of my story. I always used to think that my beginning was one afternoon in my community when my mother had told me that I had escaped three arranged marriages by the time I was two. Or one evening when electricity had failed for eight hours in our community  and my dad sat  surrounded by all of us  telling us stories of when he was a little kid struggling to go to school while his father  who was a farmer  wanted him to work in the fields with him. Or that dark night when I was    when three little kids had come to me and they whispered in my ear that my friend was murdered in something called the honor killings. But then I realized that  as much as I know that these moments have contributed on my journey  they have influenced my journey but they have not been the beginning of it  but the true beginning of my journey was in front of a mud house in upper Sindh of Pakistan  where my father held the hand of my    year old mother and they decided to walk out of the village to go to a town where they could send their kids to school. In a way  I feel like my life is kind of a result of some wise choices and decisions they've made. And just like that  another of their decisions was to keep me and my siblings connected to our roots. While we were living in a community I fondly remember as called Ribabad  which means community of the poor  my dad made sure that we also had a house in our rural homeland. I come from an indigenous tribe in the mountains of Balochistan called Brahui. Brahui  or Brohi  means mountain dweller  and it is also my language. Thanks to my father's very strict rules about connecting to our customs  I had to live a beautiful life of songs   cultures  traditions  stories  mountains  and a lot of sheep. But then  living in two extremes between the traditions  of my culture  of my village  and then modern education in my school wasn't easy. I was aware that I was the only girl who got to have such freedom  and I was guilty of it. While going to school in Karachi and Hyderabad  a lot of my cousins and childhood friends were getting married off  some to older men  some in exchange  some even as second wives. I got to see the beautiful tradition and its magic fade in front of me when I saw that the birth of a girl child was celebrated with sadness  when women were told to have patience as their main virtue. Up until I was     I healed my sadness by crying  mostly at nights  when everyone would sleep and I would sob in my pillow  until that one night  when I found out my friend was killed in the name of honor. Honor killings is a custom where men and women are suspected of having relationships before or outside of the marriage  and they're killed by their family for it. Usually the killer is the brother or father or the uncle in the family. The U.N. reports there are about       honor murders every year in Pakistan  and these are only the reported cases. A custom that kills did not make any sense to me  and I knew I had to do something about it this time. I was not going to cry myself to sleep. I was going to do something  anything  to stop it. I was       I started writing poetry and going door to door telling everybody about honor killings and why it happens  why it should be stopped  and raising awareness about it until I actually found a much  much  better way to handle this issue. In those days  we were living in a very small  one roomed house in Karachi. Every year  during the monsoon seasons  our house would flood up with water    rainwater and sewage    and my mom and dad would be taking the water out. In those days  my dad brought home a huge machine  a computer. It was so big it looked as if it was going to take up half of the only room we had  and had so many pieces and wires that needed to be connected. But it was still the most exciting thing that has ever happened to me and my sisters. My oldest brother Ali got to be in charge of taking care of the computer  and all of us were given    to    minutes every day to use it. Being the oldest of eight kids  I got to use it the last  and that was after I had washed the dishes  cleaned the house  made dinner with my mom  and put blankets on the floor for everyone to sleep  and after that   I would run to the computer  connect it to the Internet  and have pure joy and wonder for    to    minutes. In those days  I had discovered a website called Joogle.  Google   Laughter  In my frantic wish to do something about this custom  I made use of Google and discovered Facebook  a website where people can connect to anyone around the world  and so  from my very tiny  cement roofed room in Karachi  I connected with people in the U.K.  the U.S.  Australia and Canada  and created a campaign called WAKE UP Campaign against Honor Killings. It became enormous in just a few months. I got a lot of support from all around the world. Media was connecting to us. A lot of people were reaching out trying to raise awareness with us. It became so big that it went from online to the streets of my hometown  where we would do rallies and strikes trying to change the policies  in Pakistan for women's support. And while I thought everything was perfect  my team    which was basically my friends and neighbors at that time    thought everything was going so well  we had no idea a big opposition was coming to us. My community stood up against us  saying we were spreading un Islamic behavior. We were challenging centuries old customs in those communities. I remember my father receiving anonymous letters saying   Your daughter  is spreading Western culture in the honorable societies.  Our car was stoned at one point. One day I went to the office and found our metal signboard wrinkled and broken as if a lot of people had been hitting it with something heavy. Things got so bad that I had to hide myself in many ways. I would put up the windows of the car  veil my face  not speak while I was in public  but eventually situations got worse when my life was threatened  and I had to leave  back to Karachi  and our actions stopped. Back in Karachi  as an    year old  I thought this was the biggest failure of my entire life. I was devastated. As a teenager  I was blaming myself for everything that happened. And it turns out  when we started reflecting  we did realize that it was actually me and my team's fault. There were two big reasons why our campaign had failed big time. One of those  the first reason  is we were standing against core values of people. We were saying no to something that was very important to them  challenging their code of honor  and hurting them deeply in the process. And number two  which was very important for me to learn  and amazing  and surprising for me to learn  was that we were not including the true heroes who should be fighting for themselves. The women in the villages had no idea we were fighting for them in the streets. Every time I would go back  I would find my cousins and friends with scarves on their faces  and I would ask   What happened   And they'd be like    Our husbands beat us.  But we are working in the streets for you  We are changing the policies. How is that not impacting their life  So then we found out something which was very amazing for us. The policies of a country do not necessarily always affect the tribal and rural communities. It was devastating    like  oh  we can't actually do something about this  And we found out there's a huge gap when it comes to official policies and the real truth on the ground. So this time  we were like  we are going to do something different. We are going to use strategy  and we are going to go back and apologize. Yes  apologize. We went back to the communities and we said we are  very ashamed of what we did. We are here to apologize  and in fact  we are here to make it up to you. How do we do that  We are going to promote three of your main cultures. We know that it's music  language  and embroidery. Nobody believed us. Nobody wanted to work with us. It took a lot of convincing and discussions with these communities until they agreed that we are going to promote their language by making a booklet of their stories  fables and old tales in the tribe  and we would promote their music by making a CD of the songs from the tribe  and some drumbeating. And the third  which was my favorite  was we would promote their embroidery by making a center in the village where women would come every day to make embroidery. And so it began. We worked with one village  and we started our first center. It was a beautiful day. We started the center. Women were coming to make embroidery  and going through a life changing process of education  learning about their rights  what Islam says about their rights  and enterprise development  how they can create money  and then how they can create money from money  how they can fight the customs that have been destroying their lives from so many centuries  because in Islam  in reality  women are supposed to be shoulder to shoulder with men. Women have so much status that we have not been hearing  that they have not been hearing  and we needed to tell them that they need to know where their rights are and how to take them by themselves  because they can do it and we can't. So this was the model which actually came out    very amazing. Through embroidery we were promoting their traditions. We went into the village. We would mobilize the community. We would make a center inside where    women will come for six months to learn about value addition of traditional embroidery  enterprise development  life skills and basic education  and about their rights and how to say no to those customs and how to stand as leaders for themselves and the society. After six months  we would connect these women to loans and to markets where they can become local entrepreneurs in their communities. We soon called this project Sughar. Sughar is a local word used in many  many languages in Pakistan. It means skilled and confident women. I truly believe  to create women leaders  there's only one thing you have to do  Just let them know that they have what it takes to be a leader. These women you see here  they have strong skills and potential to be leaders. All we had to do was remove the barriers that surrounded them  and that's what we decided to do. But then while we were thinking everything was going well  once again everything was fantastic  we found our next setback  A lot of men started seeing the visible changes in their wife. She's speaking more  she's making decisions    oh my gosh  she's handling  everything in the house. They stopped them from coming to the centers  and this time  we were like  okay  time for strategy two. We went to the fashion  industry in Pakistan and decided to do research about what happens there. Turns out the fashion industry in Pakistan is very strong and growing day by day  but there is less contribution from the tribal areas and to the tribal areas  especially women. So we decided to launch our first ever tribal women's very own fashion brand  which is now called Nomads. And so women started earning more  they started contributing more financially to the house  and men had to think again before saying no to them when they were coming to the centers. Thank you  thank you. In       we launched our first Sughar Hub instead of a center. We partnered with TripAdvisor and created a cement hall in the middle of a village and invited so many other organizations to work over there. We created this platform for the nonprofits so they can touch and work on the other issues that Sughar is not working on  which would be an easy place  for them to give trainings  use it as a farmer school  even as a marketplace  and anything they want to use it for  and they have been doing really amazingly. And so far  we have been able to support     women in    villages around Pakistan. But that's actually not what I want. My dream is to reach out to one million women in the next    years  and to make sure that happens  this year we launched Sughar Foundation in the U.S. It is not just going to fund Sughar but many other organizations in Pakistan to replicate the idea and to find even more innovative ways to unleash the rural women's potential in Pakistan. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Khalida  you are quite the force of nature. I mean  this story  in many ways  just seems beyond belief. It's incredible that someone so young could do achieve this much through so much force and ingenuity. So I guess one question  This is a spectacular dream to reach out and empower a million women    how much of the current  success depends on you  the force of this magnetic personality  How does it scale  Khalida Brohi  I think my job is to give the inspiration out  give my dream out. I can't teach how to do it  because there are so many different ways. We have been experimenting with three ways only. There are a hundred different ways to unleash potential in women. I would just give the inspiration and that's my job. I will keep doing it. Sughar will still be growing. We are planning to reach out to two more villages  and soon I believe  we will be scaling out of Pakistan into South Asia and beyond. CA  I love that when you talked about your team in the talk  I mean  you were all    at the time. What did this team look like  This was school friends  right  KB  Do people here believe that I'm at an age where I'm supposed to be a grandmother in my village  My mom was married at nine  and I am the oldest woman not married and not doing anything in my life in my village. CA  Wait  wait  wait  not doing anything  KB  No. CA  You're right. KB  People feel sorry for me  a lot of times. CA  But how much time are you spending now actually back in Balochistan  KB  I live over there. We live between  still  Karachi and Balochistan. My siblings are all going to school. I am still the oldest of eight siblings. CA  But what you're doing is definitely threatening to some people there. How do you handle safety  Do you feel safe  Are there issues there  KB  This question has come to me a lot of times before  and I feel like the word  fear  just comes to me and then drops  but there is one fear that I have that is different from that. The fear is that if I get killed  what would happen to the people who love me so much  My mom waits for me till late at night that I should come home. My sisters want to learn so much from me  and there are many  many girls in my community who want to talk to me and ask me different things  and I recently got engaged.  Laughs  CA  Is he here  You've got to stand up. KB  Escaping arranged marriages  I chose my own husband across the world in L.A.  a really different world. I had to fight for a whole year. That's totally a different story. But I think that's the only thing that I'm afraid of  and I don't want my mom to not see anyone when she waits in the night. CA  So people who want to help you on their way  they can go on  they can maybe buy some of these clothes that you're bringing over that are actually made  the embroidery is done back in Balochistan  KB  Yeah. CA  Or they can get involved in the foundation. KB  Definitely. We are looking for as many people as we can  because now that the foundation's in the beginning process  I am trying to learn a lot about how to operate  how to get funding or reach out to more organizations  and especially in the e commerce  which is very new for me. I mean  I am not a fashion person  believe me. CA  Well  it's been incredible to have you here. Please go on being courageous  go on being smart  and please stay safe. KB  Thank you so much. CA  Thank you  Khalida.  Applause  One of the first patients I had to see as a pediatrician was Sol  a beautiful month old baby who was admitted with signs of a severe respiratory infection. Until then  I had never seen a patient worsen so fast. In just two days she was connected to a respirator and on the third day she died. Sol had whooping cough. After discussing the case in the room and after a quite distressing catharsis  I remember my chief resident said to me   Okay  take a deep breath. Wash your face. And now comes the hardest part  We have to go talk to her parents.  At that time  a thousand questions came to mind  from   How could a one month old baby be so unfortunate   to   Could we have done something about it   Before vaccines existed  many infectious diseases killed millions of people per year. During the      flu pandemic    million people died. That's greater than Argentina's current population. Perhaps  the older ones among you remember the polio epidemic that occurred in Argentina in     . At that time  there was no vaccine available against polio. People didn't know what to do. They were going crazy. They would go painting trees with caustic lime. They'd put little bags of camphor in their children's underwear  as if that could do something. During the polio epidemic  thousands of people died. And thousands of people were left with very significant neurological damage. I know this because I read about it  because thanks to vaccines  my generation was lucky to not live through an epidemic as terrible as this. Vaccines are one of the great successes of the   th century's public health. After potable water  they are the interventions that have most reduced mortality  even more than antibiotics. Vaccines eradicated terrible diseases such as smallpox from the planet and succeeded in significantly reducing mortality due to other diseases such as measles  whooping cough  polio and many more. All these diseases are considered vaccine preventable diseases. What does this mean  That they are potentially preventable  but in order to be so  something must be done. You need to get vaccinated. I imagine that most  if not all of us here today  received a vaccine at some point in our life. Now  I'm not so sure that many of us know which vaccines or boosters we should receive after adolescence. Have you ever wondered who we are protecting when we vaccinate  What do I mean by that  Is there any other effect beyond protecting ourselves  Let me show you something. Imagine for a moment that we are in a city that has never had a case of a particular disease  such as the measles. This would mean that no one in the city has ever had contact with the disease. No one has natural defenses against  nor been vaccinated against measles. If one day  a person sick with the measles appears in this city the disease won't find much resistance and will begin spreading from person to person  and in no time it will disseminate throughout the community. After a certain time a big part of the population will be ill. This happened when there were no vaccines. Now  imagine the complete opposite case. We are in a city where more than    percent of the population has defenses against the measles  which means that they either had the disease  survived  and developed natural defenses  or that they had been immunized against measles. If one day  a person sick with the measles appears in this city  the disease will find much more resistance and won't be transmitted that much from person to person. The spread will probably remain contained and a measles outbreak won't happen. I would like you to pay attention to something. People who are vaccinated are not only protecting themselves  but by blocking the dissemination of the disease within the community  they are indirectly protecting the people in this community who are not vaccinated. They create a kind of protective shield which prevents them from coming in contact with the disease  so that these people are protected. This indirect protection that the unvaccinated people within a community receive simply by being surrounded by vaccinated people  is called herd immunity. Many people in the community depend almost exclusively on this herd immunity to be protected against disease. The unvaccinated people you see in infographics are not just hypothetical. Those people are our nieces and nephews  our children  who may be too young to receive their first shots. They are our parents  our siblings  our acquaintances  who may have a disease  or take medication that lowers their defenses. There are also people who are allergic to a particular vaccine. They could even be among us  any of us who got vaccinated  but the vaccine didn't produce the expected effect  because not all vaccines are always     percent effective. All these people depend almost exclusively on herd immunity to be protected against diseases. To achieve this effect of herd immunity  it is necessary that a large percentage of the population be vaccinated. This percentage is called the threshold. The threshold depends on many variables  It depends on the germ's characteristics  and those of the immune response that the vaccine generates. But they all have something in common. If the percentage of the population in a vaccinated community is below this threshold number  the disease will begin to spread more freely and may generate an outbreak of this disease within the community. Even diseases which were  at some point controlled may reappear. This is not just a theory. This has happened  and is still happening. In       a British researcher published an article in one of the most important medical journals  saying that the MMR vaccine  which is given for measles  mumps and rubella  was associated with autism. This generated an immediate impact. People began to stop getting vaccinated  and stopped vaccinating their children. And what happened  The number of people vaccinated  in many communities around the world  fell below this threshold. And there were outbreaks of measles in many cities in the world    in the U.S.  in Europe. Many people got sick. People died of measles. What happened  This article also generated a huge stir within the medical community. Dozens of researchers began to assess if this was actually true. Not only could no one find a causal association between MMR and autism at the population level  but it was also found that this article had incorrect claims. Even more  it was fraudulent. It was fraudulent. In fact  the journal publicly retracted the article in     . One of the main concerns and excuses for not getting vaccinated are the adverse effects. Vaccines  like other drugs  can have potential adverse effects. Most are mild and temporary. But the benefits are always greater than possible complications. When we are ill  we want to heal fast. Many of us who are here take antibiotics when we have an infection  we take anti hypertensives when we have high blood pressure  we take cardiac medications. Why  Because we are sick and we want to heal fast. And we don't question it much. Why is it so difficult to think of preventing diseases  by taking care of ourselves when we are healthy  We take care of ourselves a lot when affected by an illness  or in situations of imminent danger. I imagine most of us here  remember the influenza A pandemic which broke out in      in Argentina and worldwide. When the first cases began to come to light  we  here in Argentina  were entering the winter season. We knew absolutely nothing. Everything was a mess. People wore masks on the street  ran into pharmacies to buy alcohol gel. People would line up in pharmacies to get a vaccine  without even knowing if it was the right vaccine that would protect them against this new virus. We knew absolutely nothing. At that time  in addition to doing my fellowship at the Infant Foundation  I worked as a home pediatrician for a prepaid medicine company. I remember that I started my shift at   a.m.  and by    I already had a list of    scheduled visits. It was chaos  people didn't know what to do. I remember the types of patients that I was examining. The patients were a little older than what we were used to seeing in winter  with longer fevers. And I mentioned that to my fellowship mentor  and he  for his part  had heard the same from a colleague  about the large number of pregnant women and young adults being hospitalized in intensive care  with hard to manage clinical profiles. At that time  we set out to understand what was happening. First thing Monday morning  we took the car and went to a hospital in Buenos Aires Province  that served as a referral hospital for cases of the new influenza virus. We arrived at the hospital  it was crowded. All health staff were dressed in NASA like bio safety suits. We all had face masks in our pockets. I  being a hypochondriac  didn't breathe for two hours. But we could see what was happening. Immediately  we started reaching out to pediatricians from six hospitals in the city and in Buenos Aires Province. Our main goal was to find out how this new virus behaved in contact with our children  in the shortest time possible. A marathon work. In less than three months  we could see what effect this new H N  virus had on the     children hospitalized by this virus. We could see which children got more seriously ill  children under four  especially those less than one year old  patients with neurological diseases  and young children with chronic pulmonary diseases. Identifying these at risk groups was important to include them as priority groups in the recommendations for getting the influenza vaccine  not only here in Argentina  but also in other countries which the pandemic not yet reached. A year later  when a vaccine against the pandemic H N  virus became available  we wanted to see what happened. After a huge vaccination campaign aimed at protecting at risk groups  these hospitals  with    percent of the at risk groups vaccinated  had not hospitalized a single patient for the pandemic H N  virus. In          . In       zero. Vaccination is an act of individual responsibility  but it has a huge collective impact. If I get vaccinated  not only am I protecting myself  but I am also protecting others. Sol had whooping cough. Sol was very young  and she hadn't yet received her first vaccine against whooping cough. I still wonder what would have happened if everyone around Sol had been vaccinated. Six thousand miles of road      miles of subway track      miles of bike lanes and a half a mile of tram track  if you've ever been to Roosevelt Island. These are the numbers that make up the infrastructure of New York City. These are the statistics of our infrastructure. They're the kind of numbers you can find released in reports by city agencies. For example  the Department of Transportation will probably tell you how many miles of road they maintain. The MTA will boast how many miles of subway track there are. Most city agencies give us statistics. This is from a report this year from the Taxi and Limousine Commission  where we learn that there's about        taxis here in New York City. Pretty interesting  right  But did you ever think about where these numbers came from  Because for these numbers to exist  someone at the city agency had to stop and say  hmm  here's a number that somebody might want want to know. Here's a number  that our citizens want to know. So they go back to their raw data  they count  they add  they calculate  and then they put out reports  and those reports will have numbers like this. The problem is  how do they know all of our questions  We have lots of questions. In fact  in some ways there's literally an infinite number of questions that we can ask about our city. The agencies can never keep up. So the paradigm isn't exactly working  and I think our policymakers realize that  because in       Mayor Bloomberg signed into law what he called the most ambitious and comprehensive open data legislation in the country. In a lot of ways  he's right. In the last two years   the city has released       datasets on our open data portal  and it's pretty awesome. So you go and look at data like this  and instead of just counting the number of cabs  we can start to ask different questions. So I had a question. When's rush hour in New York City  It can be pretty bothersome. When is rush hour exactly  And I thought to myself  these cabs aren't just numbers  these are GPS recorders driving around in our city streets recording each and every ride they take. There's data there  and I looked at that data  and I made a plot of the average speed of taxis in New York City throughout the day. You can see that from about midnight to around      in the morning  speed increases  and at that point  things turn around  and they get slower and slower and slower until about      in the morning  when they end up at around    and a half miles per hour. The average taxi is going    and a half miles per hour on our city streets  and it turns out it stays that way for the entire day. So I said to myself  I guess there's no rush hour in New York City. There's just a rush day. Makes sense. And this is important for a couple of reasons. If you're a transportation planner  this might be pretty interesting to know. But if you want to get somewhere quickly  you now know to set your alarm for      in the morning and you're all set. New York  right  But there's a story behind this data. This data wasn't just available  it turns out. It actually came from something called a Freedom of Information Law Request  or a FOIL Request. This is a form you can find on the Taxi and Limousine Commission website. In order to access this data  you need to go get this form  fill it out  and they will notify you  and a guy named Chris Whong did exactly that. Chris went down  and they told him   Just bring a brand new hard drive  down to our office  leave it here for five hours  we'll copy the data and you take it back.  And that's where this data came from. Now  Chris is the kind of guy who wants to make the data public  and so it ended up online for all to use  and that's where this graph came from. And the fact that it exists is amazing. These GPS recorders    really cool. But the fact that we have citizens walking around with hard drives picking up data from city agencies to make it public    it was already kind of public  you could get to it  but it was  public   it wasn't public. And we can do better than that as a city. We don't need our citizens walking around with hard drives. Now  not every dataset is behind a FOIL Request. Here is a map I made with the most dangerous intersections in New York City based on cyclist accidents. So the red areas are more dangerous. And what it shows is first the East side of Manhattan  especially in the lower area of Manhattan  has more cyclist accidents. That might make sense because there are more cyclists coming off the bridges there. But there's other hotspots worth studying. There's Williamsburg. There's Roosevelt Avenue in Queens. And this is exactly the kind of data we need for Vision Zero. This is exactly what we're looking for. But there's a story behind this data as well. This data didn't just appear. How many of you guys know this logo  Yeah  I see some shakes. Have you ever tried to copy and paste data out of a PDF and make sense of it  I see more shakes. More of you tried copying and pasting than knew the logo. I like that. So what happened is  the data that you just saw was actually on a PDF. In fact  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages of PDF put out by our very own NYPD  and in order to access it  you would either have to copy and paste for hundreds and hundreds of hours  or you could be John Krauss. John Krauss was like  I'm not going to copy and paste this data. I'm going to write a program. It's called the NYPD Crash Data Band Aid  and it goes to the NYPD's website and it would download PDFs. Every day it would search  if it found a PDF  it would download it and then it would run some PDF scraping program  and out would come the text  and it would go on the Internet  and then people could make maps like that. And the fact that the data's here  the fact that we have access to it    Every accident  by the way  is a row in this table. You can imagine how many PDFs that is. The fact that we have access to that is great  but let's not release it in PDF form  because then we're having our citizens write PDF scrapers. It's not the best use of our citizens' time  and we as a city can do better than that. Now  the good news is that the de Blasio administration actually recently released this data a few months ago  and so now we can actually have access to it  but there's a lot of data still entombed in PDF. For example  our crime data is still only available in PDF. And not just our crime data  our own city budget. Our city budget is only readable right now in PDF form. And it's not just us that can't analyze it    our own legislators who vote for the budget also only get it in PDF. So our legislators cannot analyze  the budget that they are voting for. And I think as a city we can do a little better than that as well. Now  there's a lot of data that's not hidden in PDFs. This is an example of a map I made  and this is the dirtiest waterways in New York City. Now  how do I measure dirty  Well  it's kind of a little weird  but I looked at the level of fecal coliform  which is a measurement of fecal matter in each of our waterways. The larger the circle  the dirtier the water  so the large circles are dirty water  the small circles are cleaner. What you see is inland waterways. This is all data that was sampled by the city over the last five years. And inland waterways are  in general  dirtier. That makes sense  right  And the bigger circles are dirty. And I learned a few things from this. Number one  Never swim in anything that ends in  creek  or  canal.  But number two  I also found the dirtiest waterway in New York City  by this measure  one measure. In Coney Island Creek  which is not the Coney Island you swim in  luckily. It's on the other side. But Coney Island Creek     percent of samples taken over the last five years have had fecal levels so high that it would be against state law to swim in the water. And this is not the kind of fact that you're going to see boasted in a city report  right  It's not going to be  the front page on nyc.gov. You're not going to see it there  but the fact that we can get  to that data is awesome. But once again  it wasn't super easy  because this data was not on the open data portal. If you were to go to the open data portal  you'd see just a snippet of it   a year or a few months. It was actually on the Department of Environmental Protection's website. And each one of these links is an Excel  sheet  and each Excel sheet is different. Every heading is different  you copy  paste  reorganize. When you do you can make maps and that's great  but once again  we can do better than that  as a city  we can normalize things. And we're getting there  because there's this website that Socrata makes called the Open Data Portal NYC. This is where       data sets  that don't suffer from the things I just told you live  and that number is growing  and that's great. You can download data in any format  be it CSV or PDF or Excel document. Whatever you want  you can download the data that way. The problem is  once you do  you will find that each agency codes their addresses differently. So one is street name   intersection street  street  borough  address  building  building address. So once again  you're spending time  even when we have this portal  you're spending time normalizing our address fields. And that's not the best use  of our citizens' time. We can do better than that as a city. We can standardize our addresses  and if we do   we can get more maps like this. This is a map of fire hydrants in New York City  but not just any fire hydrants. These are the top     grossing fire hydrants in terms of parking tickets. So I learned a few things from this map  and I really like this map. Number one  just don't park on the Upper East Side. Just don't. It doesn't matter where you park  you will get a hydrant ticket. Number two  I found the two highest grossing hydrants in all of New York City  and they're on the Lower East Side  and they were bringing in over        dollars a year in parking tickets. And that seemed a little strange to me when I noticed it  so I did a little digging and it turns out what you had is a hydrant and then something called a curb extension  which is like a seven foot space to walk on  and then a parking spot. And so these cars came along  and the hydrant     It's all the way over there  I'm fine   and there was actually a parking spot painted there beautifully for them. They would park there  and the NYPD disagreed with this designation and would ticket them. And it wasn't just me  who found a parking ticket. This is the Google  Street View car driving by finding the same parking ticket. So I wrote about this on my blog  on I Quant NY  and the DOT responded  and they said   While the DOT has not received any complaints about this location  we will review the roadway markings and make any appropriate alterations.  And I thought to myself  typical government response  all right  moved on with my life. But then  a few weeks later  something incredible happened. They repainted the spot  and for a second I thought I saw the future of open data  because think about what happened here. For five years  this spot was being  ticketed  and it was confusing  and then a citizen found something  they told the city  and within a few weeks the problem was fixed. It's amazing. And a lot of people see open data as being a watchdog. It's not  it's about being a partner. We can empower our citizens to be better partners for government  and it's not that hard. All we need are a few changes. If you're FOILing data  if you're seeing your data  being FOILed over and over again  let's release it to the public  that's a sign that it should be made public. And if you're a government agency releasing a PDF  let's pass legislation that requires you to post it with the underlying data  because that data is coming from somewhere. I don't know where  but it's coming from somewhere  and you can release it with the PDF. And let's adopt and share some open data standards. Let's start with our addresses here in New York City. Let's just start normalizing our addresses. Because New York is a leader in open data. Despite all this  we are absolutely a leader in open data  and if we start normalizing things  and set an open data standard  others will follow. The state will follow  and maybe the federal government  Other countries could follow  and we're not that far off from a time where you could write one program and map information from     countries. It's not science fiction. We're actually quite close. And by the way  who are we empowering with this  Because it's not just John Krauss and it's not just Chris Whong. There are hundreds of meetups going on in New York City right now  active meetups. There are thousands of people attending these meetups. These people are going after work and on weekends  and they're attending these meetups to look at open data and make our city a better place. Groups like BetaNYC  who just last week  released something called citygram.nyc that allows you to subscribe to     complaints around your own home  or around your office. You put in your address  you get local complaints. And it's not just the tech community that are after these things. It's urban planners like  the students I teach at Pratt. It's policy advocates  it's everyone  it's citizens from a diverse set of backgrounds. And with some small  incremental changes  we can unlock the passion and the ability of our citizens to harness open data and make our city even better  whether it's one dataset  or one parking spot at a time. Thank you. I'd like to start my performance by saying    percent of everything is crap. It's called Sturgeon's law  and what that means is that the majority of anything is always bad. I have a giraffe here. I'm going to throw the giraffe behind my back and whoever catches it is going to help me on this next thing. Sir  you caught the giraffe. I have a playing card in my hand. Freely name any card in the deck. Audience member     of hearts. Helder Guimar es     of hearts. You could have named any card in the deck  but you said the    of hearts. Ninety percent of everything is crap  so there's this to prove that Sturgeon was correct. Sir  this is not your show. Keep the giraffe for a moment  okay  Jesus. Crazy people. Well  the truth is  why is the majority of everything bad  And my answer is  I think we stop thinking too soon. I'll give you a clear little example  something that people used to do around the turn of the century    not this century  the other one. The idea was to take a piece of paper and fold it inside out using only your weaker hand  in my case  the left hand. Something that would look like this. By the way you reacted  I can see your lack of interest. But that's okay  I understand why. We stop thinking too soon. But if we give it a little bit more thought  like a paper clip. A paper clip makes this a little bit more interesting. Not only that  if instead of using my hand with the fingers  I use my hand closed into a fist  that makes this even a little bit more interesting. Not only that  but I will impose myself a time limit of one second  something that would look like this. Now    no  no  no. Sturgeon may be correct. But he doesn't have to be correct forever. Things can always change. Sir  what was the card  The    of hearts  There's this to prove that things can always change    the    of hearts. Secrets are important. And secrets are valuable. And this is the best secret I've ever experienced. It starts with a deck of cards onto the table  an old man and a claim   I will not touch the deck till the end.  It doesn't matter who the man was  all that matters was that sentence ringing in my head   I will not touch the deck till the end.  Now  during all this time  he was holding a small notebook that sometimes he would open and flip through the pages and look at something. But I was not really paying attention to the book because I was paying attention the deck and the claim he had made before   I will not touch the deck till the end.  Now sir  you have the giraffe. Go ahead  throw it in any direction so that you can find someone else at random. Perfect. Sir  you're going to play my role in this story. The old man turned to me and he said   You could pick a red card or a black card.  My answer was ... Audience member    The black card. HG  Indeed  It was a black card. He said   It could be a club or a spade   and my answer was ... Audience member    Spade. HG  Indeed  It was a spade. He said   It could be a high spade or a low spade.  And my answer was ... Audience member    A high spade. HG  Indeed  It was a high spade. Since it's a high spade  it could be a nine  a     a jack  king  queen or the ace of spades. And my answer was ... Audience member    The king. HG  The king of spades  indeed. Now sir  let's be fair. You selected black  you selected spade  you selected the high spade  and you selected    sorry  Audience member    King. HG  King of spades. Did you feel I influenced you in any decision  Audience member    No  I just felt your energy. HG  But it was a free choice  correct  Because if not  we could start all over again. But it was really fair  Audience member    Absolutely. HG  Now  the old man turned to me and he asked me one more question  a number between one and   . And the first number I thought of was ... Audience member      . HG  Indeed  It was the   . The old man only said one more thing   This is the end.  And I knew exactly what that meant. I knew that he was going to touch the deck. Everything that you're about to see is exactly as it looked. He took the deck out of the box. Nothing in the box. He counted   One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine    .  The tension was building.                            .  And on the     instead of the king of spades  something appeared in the middle of the deck  that later  I would realize was actually a secret. The old man stood up  he left. I never saw him again. But he left his notebook that was there from the beginning. And when I picked it up  that was the best secret I've ever experienced. We are defined by the secrets we keep and by the secrets we share. And this was his way of sharing a secret with me. Crazy shit  Now    I believe that amazing things happen all the time. I really do. And the reason why we don't see them as often  it's because we don't place ourselves in a position to search for those amazing things. But what if we decided to search for those amazing things  for those small coincidences in life that are truly amazing  So you have the giraffe  go ahead  throw it in any direction so you find one last person at random. Sir  I'm going to ask you  do you have  with you  a United States    bill  Audience member    I think so. HG  Yes  You see  a coincidence  Let's make sure you have it. Do you have it  Audience member    Yes. HG  Yes  Perfect. Now  I want you to do exactly the same thing I am about to do. I have a dollar bill here to explain. I want you to take the dollar bill  and fold the Washington part inside  like this. So you get this kind of big square  okay  Now  I want you to take the bill and fold it like this  lengthwise  so it becomes like a rectangle  and then again    really fold it  really crease it    and when you have it  please fold the bill again into a little square like this and let me know when you have it. Do you have it  Perfect. Now  I'm going to approach  and before we start  I want to make sure that we do this in very  very serious conditions. First of all  I want to ensure that we have a marker and we have a paper clip. First of all  take the marker and go ahead and sign the bill. And this is the reason why  later  I'm going to be doing a bunch of stuff on stage and I don't want you to think  oh  while I was distracted by Helder  someone came onstage and swapped the bill. So I want to make sure it's exactly the same bill. Now not only that  I want you to take the paper clip and put it around the bill. So even if nobody comes onstage and switches the bill  I don't have enough time to go open the bill and close it and see what I don't want to see. Is that fair  Now you can give me the marker back. And just like that  very clearly  I want to make sure that we place this in full view from the beginning of this experience and to make sure that everyone is going to see it  we're going to actually have a camera man onstage. Yes  perfect  so that you can see. That's your signature  Yes  Perfect. Now  we're going to use also the deck and a glass for this. And we're going to put ourselves in a position to search for an amazing coincidence. Do you mind  can you help me with this  Go ahead and take some cards and shuffle. And do you mind  can you take some cards and shuffle  You can take some cards and shuffle. You can shuffle cards in a variety of ways. You can shuffle cards like this. You can shuffle cards in a more messed up way  something like this. You can shuffle cards in the American way. As a Portuguese  I don't feel entitled to teach you guys how to do it. But the important part is after shuffling the cards  always remember to cut and complete the cards. Do you mind doing that for me  sir  Please cut and complete. And when you have it  place the cards up in the air. And you too  cut and complete and up in the air. Up in the air. A deck of cards cut and shuffled by one  two  three  four and five people. Now  very clearly  I'm going to gather the deck together. And just like that. I'm going to search for a coincidence in front of everyone. I'm going to try. I have some cards that maybe  maybe they don't mean anything. But maybe that's because we are not paying close attention. Because maybe  maybe they mean a lot. Before we start  sir  you gave me a dollar bill. Is that your signature  Audience member    Yes it is. HG  I want you to see very clearly that I'm going to open your bill and reveal a small secret that we created. And the secret of this dollar bill is the serial number. Madam  can you take the dollar bill  In the serial number  there is a letter. What is the first number after the letter  Audience member    Seven. HG  Seven. Seven. But  that's maybe just one coincidence. What is the second number  Audience member    Nine. So after the seven  we have a nine. And after the nine  Audience member    Two. HG  The two. And after the two  Audience member    Three. HG  Three  and after  Audience member    Three. HG  Three. Audience member    Seven. HG  Seven. Audience member    Four. HG  Four. Audience member    Two. HG  Two  and  Audience member    Q. HG  Q like in queen  The queen of clubs  All the cards in order  just for you. And that's my show. Thank you very much and have a nice night.
