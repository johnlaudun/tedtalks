America's public energy conversation boils down to this question  Would you rather die of A  oil wars  or B  climate change  or C  nuclear holocaust  or D  all of the above  Oh  I missed one  or E  none of the above  That's the one we're not normally offered. What if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing  Could we have fuel without fear  Could we reinvent fire  You see  fire made us human  fossil fuels made us modern. But now we need a new fire that makes us safe  secure  healthy and durable. Let's see how. Four fifths of the world's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo. Those fossil fuels have built our civilization. They've created our wealth. They've enriched the lives of billions. But they also have rising costs to our security  economy  health and environment that are starting to erode  if not outweigh their benefits. So we need a new fire. And switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity  each of which puts two fifths of the fossil carbon in the air. But they're really quite distinct. Less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil    although almost half is made from coal. Their uses are quite concentrated. Three fourths of our oil fuel is transportation. Three fourths of our electricity powers buildings. And the rest of both runs factories. So very efficient vehicles  buildings and factories save oil and coal  and also natural gas that can displace both of them. But today's energy system is not just inefficient  it is also disconnected  aging  dirty and insecure. So it needs refurbishment. By      though  it could become efficient  connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos  factories and buildings all relying on a modern  secure and resilient electricity system. We can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by      and use one third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply. This could cost  by       five trillion dollars less in net present value  that is expressed as a lump sum today  than business as usual    assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero    a conservatively low estimate. Yet this cheaper energy system could support     percent bigger U.S. economy all without needing oil or coal  or for that matter nuclear energy. Moreover  this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of Congress and no new federal taxes  mandate subsidies or laws and running Washington gridlock. Let me say that again. I'm going to tell you how to get the United States completely off oil and coal  five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of Congress led by business for profit. In other words  we're going to use our most effective institutions    private enterprise co evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions. And whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security  or environmental stewardship and climate protection and public health  reinventing fire makes sense and makes money. General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies. So in reinventing fire  we integrated all four sectors that use energy    transportation  buildings  industry and electricity    and we integrated four kinds of innovation  not just technology and policy  but also design and business strategy. Those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts  especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities. Oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day  plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs  raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP. Our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles. So let's start by making autos oil free. Two thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight. And every unit of energy you save at the wheels  by taking out weight or drag  saves seven units in the tank  because you don't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels. Unfortunately  over the past quarter century  epidemic obesity has made our two ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have. But today  ultralight  ultrastrong materials  like carbon fiber composites  can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build. Lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them  so their engines get smaller. Indeed  that sort of vehicle fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper. So sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today  while the driving cost  even from the start  is very much lower. So these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of Victorian engine and seal stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other    namely ultralight materials  making them into structures and electric propulsion. The sales can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary feebates  that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on inefficient ones. And just in the first two years the biggest of Europe's five feebate programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency. The resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers. Of course  computers and electronics are now America's biggest industry  while typewriter makers have vanished. So vehicle fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next    years  but then also make electrification affordable  and that displaces the rest of the oil. America could lead this next automotive revolution. Currently the leader is Germany. Last year  Volkswagen announced that by next year they'll be producing this carbon fiber plugin hybrid getting     miles a gallon. Also last year  BMW announced this carbon fiber electric car  they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries. And they said   We do not intend to be a typewriter maker.  Audi claimed it's going to beat them both by a year. Seven years ago  an even faster and cheaper American manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part  which doubles as a carbon cap. In one minute    and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is. Don't worry about dropping it  it's tougher than titanium. Tom Friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it. But such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance. They can save four fifths of the capital needed to make autos. They can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to    times as much crash energy per pound as steel. If we made all of our autos this way  it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half Saudi Arabias  or half an OPEC  by drilling in the Detroit formation  a very prospective play. And all those mega barrels under Detroit cost an average of    bucks a barrel. They are all American  carbon free and inexhaustible. The same physics and the same business logic also apply to big vehicles. In the five years ending with       Walmart saved    percent of the fuel per ton mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design. But just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two thirds. And combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes  now on the drawing board  can save close to a trillion dollars. Also today's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military R D has given us the Internet  the Global Positioning System and the jet engine and microchip industries. As we design and build vehicles better  we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving. Instead of just seeing the travel grow  we can use innovative pricing  charging for road infrastructure by the mile  not by the gallon. We can use some smart IT to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride sharing. We can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be  so they don't need to go somewhere else. And we can use smart IT to make traffic free flowing. Together  those things can give us the same or better access with    to    percent less driving  saving another  .  trillion dollars  plus  .  trillion dollars from using trucks more productively. So    years hence  when you add it all up  a far more mobile U.S. economy can use no oil. Saving or displacing barrels for    bucks rather than buying them for over a hundred  adds up to a    trillion net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero. So to get mobility without oil  to phase out the oil  we can get efficient and then switch fuels. Those     to     mile per gallon equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells  electricity and advanced biofuels. The trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels. The trucks could even use natural gas. But no vehicles will need oil. And the most biofuel we might need  just three million barrels a day  can be made two thirds from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate. Our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call  institutional acupuncture.  We figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly  we stick little needles in it to get it flowing  working with partners like Ford and Walmart and the Pentagon. And the long transition is already well under way. In fact  three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil  not in supply  but in demand. And Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peak around     . In other words  oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices. But the electrified vehicles don't need to burden the electricity grid. Rather  when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids  they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that help the grid integrate varying solar and wind power. So the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately. And they also converge the oil story with our second big story  saving electricity and then making it differently. And those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound and diverse disruptions than any other sector  because we've got   st century technology and speed colliding head on with   th and   th century institutions  rules and cultures. Changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it. Most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving it keep improving faster than we're installing them. So the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper. But as efficiency in buildings and industry starts to grow faster than the economy  America's electricity use could actually shrink  even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos. And we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends. Over the next    years  buildings  which use three quarters of the electricity  can triple or quadruple their energy productivity  saving  .  trillion dollars  net present value  with a    percent internal rate of return or in English  the savings are worth four times what they cost. And industry can accelerate too  doubling its energy productivity with a    percent internal rate of return. The key is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings. That is  it can give you expanding returns  not diminishing returns. That is how our      retrofit is saving over two fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building    remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site into super windows that pass light  but reflect heat. plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third. And then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved    million dollars of capital cost  which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years. Integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry. Dow's billion dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars. But industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars of energy still to save. For example  three fifths of the world's electricity runs motors. Half of that runs pumps and fans. And those can all be made more efficient  and the motors that turn them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating    improvements  paying back in about a year. But first we ought to be capturing bigger  cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks. For example  pumps  the biggest use of motors  move liquid through pipes. But a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least    percent less energy  not by getting better pumps  but just by replacing long  thin  crooked pipes with fat  short  straight pipes. This is not about new technology  it's just rearranging our metal furniture. Of course  it also shrinks the pumping equipment and its capital costs. So what do such savings mean for the electricity that is three fifths used in motors  Well  from the coal burned at the power plant through all these compounding losses  only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow. But now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards  and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves    units of fuel cost  pollution and what Hunter Lovins calls  global weirding  back at the power plant. And of course  as you go back upstream  the components get smaller and therefore cheaper. Our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than    billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns    everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries. Typically our retrofit designs save about    to    percent of the energy and pay back in a few years  while the new facility designs save    to    odd percent with generally lower capital cost. Now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity  chiefly renewables. China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost. In fact  these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart. And Germany now has more solar workers than America has steel workers. Already in about    states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill. Such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company. And this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee jeebees and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams. Renewables are no longer a fringe activity. For each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable  mainly lately in developing countries. In       renewables other than big hydro  particularly wind and solar cells  got     billion dollars of private investment  and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding    billion watts in that one year. That happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year    a number that goes up    or    percent a year. In contrast  the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity and the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk. In fact in this country  no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital  despite seven years of     plus percent subsidies. So how else could we replace the coal fired power plants  Well efficiency and gas can displace them all at just below their operating cost and  combined with renewables  can displace them more than    times at less than their replacement cost. But we only need to replace them once. We're often told though that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on  because they're       whereas wind and solar power are variable  and hence supposedly unreliable. Actually no generator is     . They all break. And when a big plant goes down  you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds  often for weeks or months  often without warning. That is exactly why we've designed the grid to back up failed plants with working plants. And in exactly the same way  the grid can handle wind and solar power's forecastable variations. Hourly simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they're forecasted  integrated and diversified by both type and location. And that's true both for continental areas like the U.S. or Europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid. That is how  for example  four German states in      were    to    percent wind powered. Portugal was    percent renewable powered  Denmark   . And it's how all of Europe can shift to renewable electricity. In America  our aging  dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by     . And whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same  about six trillion dollars at present value    whether we buy more of what we've got or new nuclear and so called clean coal  or renewables that are more or less centralized. But those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks  around national security  fuel  water  finance  technology  climate and health. For example  our over centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or a terrorist attack. But that blackout risk disappears  and all of the other risks are best managed  with distributed renewables organized into local micro grids that normally interconnect  but can stand alone at need. That is  they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly. That approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting for its own power supply. They think they need that  how about the rest of us that they're defending  We want our stuff to work too. At about the same cost as business as usual  this would maximize national security  customer choice  entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation. Together  efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector. Traditionally utilities build a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables. And those utilities were rewarded  as they still are in    states  for selling you more electricity. However  especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills  the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency  demand response  cogeneration  renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage. So our energy future is not fate  but choice  and that choice is very flexible. In       for example  government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP could never go down. And I heretically suggested it could go down several fold. Well that's what's actually happened so far. It's fallen by half. But with today's much better technologies  more mature delivery channels and integrative design  we can do far more and even cheaper. So to solve the energy problem  we just needed to enlarge it. And the results may at first seem incredible  but as Marshall McLuhan said   Only puny secrets need protection. Big discoveries are protected by public incredulity.  Now combine the electricity and oil revolutions  both driven by modern efficiency  and you get the really big story  reinventing fire  where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by       saving   trillion dollars  growing the economy  .  fold  strengthening out national security  oh  and by the way  by getting rid of the oil and coal  reducing the fossil carbon emissions by    to    percent. Now if you like any of those outcomes  you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important. So focusing on outcomes  not motives  can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge. This also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges    climate change  nuclear proliferation  energy insecurity  energy poverty    all of which make us less safe. Now our team at RMI helps smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives  with some more hatching. Of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there too. Former oil man Maurice Strong said   Not all the fossils are in the fuel.  But as Edgar Woolard  who used to chair Dupont  reminds us   Companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem because   he said   they simply won't be around long term.  I've described not just a once in a civilization business opportunity  but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species. We humans are inventing a new fire  not dug from below  but flowing from above  not scarce  but bountiful  not local  but everywhere  not transient  but permanent  not costly  but free. And but for a little transitional tail of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure  this new fire is flameless. Efficiently used  it really can do our work without working our undoing. Each of you owns a piece of that    trillion prize. And our new book  Reinventing Fire  describes how you can capture it. So with the conversation just begun at ReinventingFire.com  let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other  with everyone around you  to help make the world richer  fairer  cooler and safer by together reinventing fire. Thank you. Usually I like working in my shop  but when it's raining and the driveway outside turns into a river  then I just love it. And I'll cut some wood and drill some holes and watch the water  and maybe I'll have to walk around and look for washers. You have no idea how much time I spend. This is the  Double Raindrop.  Of all my sculptures  it's the most talkative. It adds together the interference pattern from two raindrops that land near each other. Instead of expanding circles  they're expanding hexagons. All the sculptures move by mechanical means. Do you see how there's three peaks to the yellow sine wave  Right here I'm adding a sine wave with four peaks and turning it on. Eight hundred two liter soda bottles    oh yea. Four hundred aluminum cans. Tule is a reed that's native to California  and the best thing about working with it is that it smells just delicious. A single drop of rain increasing amplitude. The spiral eddy that trails a paddle on a rafting trip. This adds together four different waves. And here I'm going to pull out the double wavelengths and increase the single. The mechanism that drives it has nine motors and about       pulleys. Four hundred and forty five strings in a three dimensional weave. Transferred to a larger scale    actually a lot larger  with a lot of help           bicycle reflectors    a    day install.  Connected  is a collaboration with choreographer Gideon Obarzanek. Strings attached to dancers. This is very early rehearsal footage  but the finished work's on tour and is actually coming through L.A. in a couple weeks. A pair of helices and    wooden slats. Take your finger and draw this line. Summer  fall  winter  spring  noon  dusk  dark  dawn. Have you ever seen those stratus clouds that go in parallel stripes across the sky  Did you know that's a continuous sheet of cloud that's dipping in and out of the condensation layer  What if every seemingly isolated object was actually just where the continuous wave of that object poked through into our world  The Earth is neither flat nor round. It's wavy. It sounds good  but I'll bet you know in your gut that it's not the whole truth  and I'll tell you why. I have a two year old daughter who's the best thing ever. And I'm just going to come out and say it  My daughter is not a wave. And you might say   Surely  Rueben  if you took even just the slightest step back  the cycles of hunger and eating  waking and sleeping  laughing and crying would emerge as pattern.  But I would say   If I did that  too much would be lost.  This tension between the need to look deeper and the beauty and immediacy of the world  where if you even try to look deeper you've already missed what you're looking for  this tension is what makes the sculptures move. And for me  the path between these two extremes takes the shape of a wave. Let me show you one more. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thanks. June Cohen  Looking at each of your sculptures  they evoke so many different images. Some of them are like the wind and some are like waves  and sometimes they look alive and sometimes they seem like math. Is there an actual inspiration behind each one  Are you thinking of something physical or somthing tangible as you design it  RM  Well some of them definitely have a direct observation    like literally two raindrops falling  and just watching that pattern is so stunning. And then just trying to figure out how to make that using stuff. I like working with my hands. There's nothing better than cutting a piece of wood and trying to make it move. JC  And does it ever change  Do you think you're designing one thing  and then when it's produced it looks like something else  RM  The  Double Raindrop  I worked on for nine months  and when I finally turned it on  I actually hated it. The very moment I turned it on  I hated it. It was like a really deep down gut reaction  and I wanted to throw it out. And I happened to have a friend who was over  and he said   Why don't you just wait.  And I waited  and the next day I liked it a bit better  the next day I liked it a bit better  and now I really love it. And so I guess  one  the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes  and two  it does not look like as expected. JC  The relationship evolves over time. Well thank you so much. That was a gorgeous treat for us. RM  Thanks.  JC  Thank you  Reuben.  I don't know why  but I'm continually amazed to think that two and a half billion of us around the world are connected to each other through the Internet and that at any point in time more than    percent of the world's population can go online to learn  to create and to share. And the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this is also continuing to go grow. A recent study showed that the young generation alone is spending over eight hours a day online. As the parent of a nine year old girl  that number seems awfully low. But just as the Internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us  it has also opened up each and every one of us to the world. And increasingly  the price we're being asked to pay for all of this connectedness is our privacy. Today  what many of us would love to believe is that the Internet is a private place  it's not. And with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen  we are like Hansel and Gretel leaving breadcrumbs of our personal information everywhere we travel through the digital woods. We are leaving our birthdays  our places of residence  our interests and preferences  our relationships  our financial histories  and on and on it goes. Now don't get me wrong  I'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing. In fact  when I know the data that's being shared and I'm asked explicitly for my consent  I want some sites to understand my habits. It helps them suggest books for me to read or movies for my family to watch or friends for us to connect with. But when I don't know and when I haven't been asked  that's when the problem arises. It's a phenomenon on the Internet today called behavioral tracking  and it is very big business. In fact  there's an entire industry formed around following us through the digital woods and compiling a profile on each of us. And when all of that data is held  they can do almost whatever they want with it. This is an area today that has very few regulations and even fewer rules. Except for some of the recent announcements here in the United States and in Europe  it's an area of consumer protection that's almost entirely naked. So let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further. The visualization you see forming behind me is called Collusion and it's an experimental browser add on that you can install in your Firefox browser that helps you see where your Web data is going and who's tracking you. The red dots you see up there are sites that are behavioral tracking that I have not navigated to  but are following me. The blue dots are the sites that I've actually navigated directly to. And the gray dots are sites that are also tracking me  but I have no idea who they are. All of them are connected  as you can see  to form a picture of me on the Web. And this is my profile. So let me go from an example to something very specific and personal. I installed Collusion in my own laptop two weeks ago and I let it follow me around for what was a pretty typical day. Now like most of you  I actually start my day going online and checking email. I then go to a news site  look for some headlines. And in this particular case I happened to like one of them on the merits of music literacy in schools and I shared it over a social network. Our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table  and I asked her   Is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school   And she  of course  naturally as a nine year old  looked at me and said quizzically   What's literacy   So I sent her online  of course  to look it up. Now let me stop here. We are not even two bites into breakfast and there are already nearly    sites that are tracking me. I have navigated to a total of four. So let me fast forward through the rest of my day. I go to work  I check email  I log onto a few more social sites  I blog  I check more news reports  I share some of those news reports  I go look at some videos  pretty typical day    in this case  actually fairly pedantic    and at the end of the day  as my day winds down  look at my profile. The red dots have exploded. The gray dots have grown exponentially. All in all  there's over     sites that are now tracking my personal information  most all of them without my consent. I look at this picture and it freaks me out. This is nothing. I am being stalked across the Web. And why is this happening  Pretty simple    it's huge business. The revenue of the top handful of companies in this space is over    billion dollars today. And as adults  we're certainly not alone. At the same time I installed my own Collusion profile  I installed one for my daughter. And on one single Saturday morning  over two hours on the Internet  here's her Collusion profile. This is a nine year old girl navigating to principally children's sites. I move from this  from freaked out to enraged. This is no longer me being a tech pioneer or a privacy advocate  this is me being a parent. Imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook and recorded their every movement. I can tell you  there isn't a person in this room that would sit idly by. We'd take action. It may not be good action  but we would take action. We can't sit idly by here either. This is happening today. Privacy is not an option  and it shouldn't be the price we accept for just getting on the Internet. Our voices matter and our actions matter even more. Today we've launched Collusion. You can download it  install it in Firefox  to see who is tracking you across the Web and following you through the digital woods. Going forward  all of our voices need to be heard. Because what we don't know can actually hurt us. Because the memory of the Internet is forever. We are being watched. It's now time for us to watch the watchers. Thank you. What you have here is an electronic cigarette. It's something that's  since it was invented a year or two ago  has given me untold happiness. A little bit of it  I think  is the nicotine  but there's something much bigger than that. Which is ever since  in the U.K.  they banned smoking in public places  I've never enjoyed a drinks party ever again. And the reason  I only worked out just the other day  which is when you go to a drinks party and you stand up and you hold a glass of red wine and you talk endlessly to people  you don't actually want to spend all the time talking. It's really  really tiring. Sometimes you just want to stand there silently  alone with your thoughts. Sometimes you just want to stand in the corner and stare out of the window. Now the problem is  when you can't smoke  if you stand and stare out of the window on your own  you're an antisocial  friendless idiot. If you stand and stare out of the window on your own with a cigarette  you're a fucking philosopher. So the power of reframing things cannot be overstated. What we have is exactly the same thing  the same activity  but one of them makes you feel great and the other one  with just a small change of posture  makes you feel terrible. And I think one of the problems with classical economics is it's absolutely preoccupied with reality. And reality isn't a particularly good guide to human happiness. Why  for example  are pensioners much happier than the young unemployed  Both of them  after all  are in exactly the same stage of life. You both have too much time on your hands and not much money. But pensioners are reportedly very  very happy  whereas the unemployed are extraordinarily unhappy and depressed. The reason  I think  is that the pensioners believe they've chosen to be pensioners  whereas the young unemployed feel it's been thrust upon them. In England the upper middle classes have actually solved this problem perfectly  because they've re branded unemployment. If you're an upper middle class English person  you call unemployment  a year off.  And that's because having a son who's unemployed in Manchester is really quite embarrassing  but having a son who's unemployed in Thailand is really viewed as quite an accomplishment. But actually the power to re brand things    to understand that actually our experiences  costs  things don't actually much depend on what they really are  but on how we view them    I genuinely think can't be overstated. There's an experiment I think Daniel Pink refers to where you put two dogs in a box and the box has an electric floor. Every now and then an electric shock is applied to the floor  which pains the dogs. The only difference is one of the dogs has a small button in its half of the box. And when it nuzzles the button  the electric shock stops. The other dog doesn't have the button. It's exposed to exactly the same level of pain as the dog in the first box  but it has no control over the circumstances. Generally the first dog can be relatively content. The second dog lapses into complete depression. The circumstances of our lives may actually matter less to our happiness than the sense of control we feel over our lives. It's an interesting question. We ask the question    the whole debate in the Western world is about the level of taxation. But I think there's another debate to be asked  which is the level of control we have over our tax money. That what costs us    pounds in one context can be a curse. What costs us    pounds in a different context we may actually welcome. You know  pay        pounds in tax toward health and you're merely feeling a mug. Pay        pounds to endow a hospital ward and you're called a philanthropist. I'm probably in the wrong country to talk about willingness to pay tax. So I'll give you one in return. How you frame things really matters. Do you call it the bailout of Greece or the bailout of a load of stupid banks which lent to Greece  Because they are actually the same thing. What you call them actually affects how you react to them  viscerally and morally. I think psychological value is great to be absolutely honest. One of my great friends  a professor called Nick Chater  who's the Professor of Decision Sciences in London  believes that we should spend far less time looking into humanity's hidden depths and spend much more time exploring the hidden shallows. I think that's true actually. I think impressions have an insane effect on what we think and what we do. But what we don't have is a really good model of human psychology. At least pre Kahneman perhaps  we didn't have a really good model of human psychology to put alongside models of engineering  of neoclassical economics. So people who believed in psychological solutions didn't have a model. We didn't have a framework. This is what Warren Buffett's business partner Charlie Munger calls  a latticework on which to hang your ideas.  Engineers  economists  classical economists all had a very  very robust existing latticework on which practically every idea could be hung. We merely have a collection of random individual insights without an overall model. And what that means is that in looking at solutions  we've probably given too much priority to what I call technical engineering solutions  Newtonian solutions  and not nearly enough to the psychological ones. You know my example of the Eurostar. Six million pounds spent to reduce the journey time between Paris and London by about    minutes. For  .   percent of this money you could have put WiFi on the trains  which wouldn't have reduced the duration of the journey  but would have improved its enjoyment and its usefullness far more. For maybe    percent of the money  you could have paid all of the world's top male and female supermodels to walk up and down the train handing out free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers. You'd still have five  million  pounds in change  and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down. Why were we not given the chance to solve that problem psychologically  I think it's because there's an imbalance  an asymmetry  in the way we treat creative  emotionally driven psychological ideas versus the way we treat rational  numerical  spreadsheet driven ideas. If you're a creative person  I think quite rightly  you have to share all your ideas for approval with people much more rational than you. You have to go in and you have to have a cost benefit analysis  a feasibility study  an ROI study and so forth. And I think that's probably right. But this does not apply the other way around. People who have an existing framework  an economic framework  an engineering framework  feel that actually logic is its own answer. What they don't say is   Well the numbers all seem to add up  but before I present this idea  I'll go and show it to some really crazy people to see if they can come up with something better.  And so we  artificially I think  prioritize what I'd call mechanistic ideas over psychological ideas. An example of a great psychological idea  The single best improvement in passenger satisfaction on the London Underground per pound spent came when they didn't add any extra trains nor change the frequency of the trains  they put dot matrix display board on the platforms. Because the nature of a wait is not just dependent on its numerical quality  its duration  but on the level of uncertainty you experience during that wait. Waiting seven minutes for a train with a countdown clock is less frustrating and irritating than waiting four minutes  knuckle biting going   When's this train going to damn well arrive   Here's a beautiful example of a psychological solution deployed in Korea. Red traffic lights have a countdown delay. It's proven to reduce the accident rate in experiments. Why  Because road rage  impatience and general irritation are massively reduced when you can actually see the time you have to wait. In China  not really understanding the principle behind this  they applied the same principle to green traffic lights. Which isn't a great idea. You're     yards away  you realize you've got five seconds to go  you floor it. The Koreans  very assiduously  did test both. The accident rate goes down when you apply this to red traffic lights  it goes up when you apply it to green traffic lights. This is all I'm asking for really in human decision making  is the consideration of these three things. I'm not asking for the complete primacy of one over the other. I'm merely saying that when you solve problems  you should look at all three of these equally and you should seek as far as possible to find solutions which sit in the sweet spot in the middle. If you actually look at a great business  you'll nearly always see all of these three things coming into play. Really  really successful businesses    Google is great  great technological success  but it's also based on a very good psychological insight  People believe something that only does one thing is better at that thing than something that does that thing and something else. It's an innate thing called goal dilution. Ayelet Fishbach has written a paper about this. Everybody else at the time of Google  more or less  was trying to be a portal. Yes  there's a search function  but you also have weather  sports scores  bits of news. Google understood that if you're just a search engine  people assume you're a very  very good search engine. All of you know this actually from when you go in to buy a television. And in the shabbier end of the row of flat screen TVs you can see are these rather despised things called combined TV and DVD players. And we have no knowledge whatsoever of the quality of those things  but we look at a combined TV and DVD player and we go   Uck. It's probably a bit of a crap telly and a bit rubbish as a DVD player.  So we walk out of the shops with one of each. Google is as much a psychological success as it is a technological one. I propose that we can use psychology to solve problems that we didn't even realize were problems at all. This is my suggestion for getting people to finish their course of antibiotics. Don't give them    white pills. Give them    white pills and six blue ones and tell them to take the white pills first and then take the blue ones. It's called chunking. The likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater when there is a milestone somewhere in the middle. One of the great mistakes  I think  of economics is it fails to understand that what something is  whether it's retirement  unemployment  cost  is a function  not only of its amount  but also its meaning. This is a toll crossing in Britain. Quite often queues happen at the tolls. Sometimes you get very  very severe queues. You could apply the same principle actually  if you like  to the security lanes in airports. What would happen if you could actually pay twice as much money to cross the bridge  but go through a lane that's an express lane  It's not an unreasonable thing to do. It's an economically efficient thing to do. Time means more to some people than others. If you're waiting trying to get to a job interview  you'd patently pay a couple of pounds more to go through the fast lane. If you're on the way to visit your mother in law  you'd probably prefer to stay on the left. The only problem is if you introduce this economically efficient solution  people hate it. Because they think you're deliberately creating delays at the bridge in order to maximize your revenue  and  Why on earth should I pay to subsidize your imcompetence   On the other hand  change the frame slightly and create charitable yield management  so the extra money you get goes not to the bridge company  it goes to charity  and the mental willingness to pay completely changes. You have a relatively economically efficient solution  but one that actually meets with public approval and even a small degree of affection  rather than being seen as bastardy. So where economists make the fundamental mistake is they think that money is money. Actually my pain experienced in paying five pounds is not just proportionate to the amount  but where I think that money is going. And I think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy. It could revolutionize the public services. It could really change things quite significantly. Here's a guy you all need to study. He's an Austrian school economist who was first active in the first half of the   th century in Vienna. What was interesting about the Austrian school is they actually grew up alongside Freud. And so they're predominantly interested in psychology. They believed that there was a discipline called praxeology  which is a prior discipline to the study of economics. Praxeology is the study of human choice  action and decision making. I think they're right. I think the danger we have in today's world is we have the study of economics considers itself to be a prior discipline to the study of human psychology. But as Charlie Munger says   If economics isn't behavioral  I don't know what the hell is.  Von Mises  interestingly  believes economics is just a subset of psychology. I think he just refers to economics as  the study of human praxeology under conditions of scarcity.  But von Mises  among many other things  I think uses an analogy which is probably the best justification and explanation for the value of marketing  the value of perceived value and the fact that we should actually treat it as being absolutely equivalent to any other kind of value. We tend to  all of us    even those of us who work in marketing    to think of value in two ways. There's the real value  which is when you make something in a factory and provide a service  and then there's a kind of dubious value  which you create by changing the way people look at things. Von Mises completely rejected this distinction. And he used this following analogy. He referred actually to strange economists called the French Physiocrats  who believed that the only true value was what you extracted from the land. So if you're a shepherd or a quarryman or a farmer  you created true value. If however  you bought some wool from the shepherd and charged a premium for converting it into a hat  you weren't actually creating value  you were exploiting the shepherd. Now von Mises said that modern economists make exactly the same mistake with regard to advertising and marketing. He says  if you run a restaurant  there is no healthy distinction to be made between the value you create by cooking the food and the value you create by sweeping the floor. One of them creates  perhaps  the primary product    the thing we think we're paying for    the other one creates a context within which we can enjoy and appreciate that product. And the idea that one of them should actually have priority over the other is fundamentally wrong. Try this quick thought experiment. Imagine a restaurant that serves Michelin starred food  but actually where the restaurant smells of sewage and there's human feces on the floor. The best thing you can do there to create value is not actually to improve the food still further  it's to get rid of the smell and clean up the floor. And it's vital we understand this. If that seems like some strange  abstruse thing  in the U.K.  the post office had a    percent success rate at delivering first class mail the next day. They decided this wasn't good enough and they wanted to get it up to   . The effort to do that almost broke the organization. If at the same time you'd gone and asked people   What percentage of first class mail arrives the next day   the average answer  or the modal answer would have been    to    percent. Now if your perception is much worse than your reality  what on earth are you doing trying to change the reality  That's like trying to improve the food in a restaurant that stinks. What you need to do is first of all tell people that    percent of mail gets there the next day  first class mail. That's pretty good. I would argue  in Britain there's a much better frame of reference  which is to tell people that more first class mail arrives the next day in the U.K. than in Germany. Because generally in Britain if you want to make us happy about something  just tell us we do it better than the Germans. Choose your frame of reference and the perceived value and therefore the actual value is completely tranformed. It has to be said of the Germans that the Germans and the French are doing a brilliant job of creating a united Europe. The only thing they don't expect is they're uniting Europe through a shared mild hatred of the French and Germans. But I'm British  that's the way we like it. What you also notice is that in any case our perception is leaky. We can't tell the difference between the quality of the food and the environment in which we consume it. All of you will have seen this phenomenon if you have your car washed or valeted. When you drive away  your car feels as if it drives better. And the reason for this  unless my car valet mysteriously is changing the oil and performing work which I'm not paying him for and I'm unaware of  is because perception is in any case leaky. Analgesics that are branded are more effective at reducing pain than analgesics that are not branded. I don't just mean through reported pain reduction  actual measured pain reduction. And so perception actually is leaky in any case. So if you do something that's perceptually bad in one respect  you can damage the other. Thank you very much. Four years ago today  exactly  actually  I started a fashion blog called Style Rookie. Last September of       I started an online magazine for teenage girls called Rookiemag.com. My name's Tavi Gevinson  and the title of my talk is  Still Figuring It Out   and the MS Paint quality of my slides was a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme  and has nothing to do with my inability to use PowerPoint.  Laughter  So I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist. I am kind of a pop culture nerd  and I think a lot about what makes a strong female character  and  you know  movies and TV shows  these things have influence. My own website. So I think the question of what makes a strong female character often goes misinterpreted  and instead we get these two dimensional superwomen who maybe have one quality that's played up a lot  like a Catwoman type  or she plays her sexuality up a lot  and it's seen as power. But they're not strong characters who happen to be female. They're completely flat  and they're basically cardboard characters. The problem with this is that then people expect women to be that easy to understand  and women are mad at themselves for not being that simple  when  in actuality  women are complicated  women are multifaceted    not because women are crazy  but because people are crazy  and women happen to be people.  Laughter  So the flaws are the key. I'm not the first person to say this. What makes a strong female character is a character who has weaknesses  who has flaws  who is maybe not immediately likable  but eventually relatable. I don't like to acknowledge a problem without also acknowledging those who work to fix it  so just wanted to acknowledge shows like  Mad Men   movies like  Bridesmaids   whose female characters or protagonists are complex  multifaceted. Lena Dunham  who's on here  her show on HBO that premiers next month   Girls   she said she wanted to start it because she felt that every woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions  and that feels accurate for all people  but you don't see women represented like that as much. Congrats  guys.  Laughs  But I don't feel that   I still feel that there are some types of women who are not represented that way  and one group that we'll focus on today are teens  because I think teenagers are especially contradictory and still figuring it out  and in the '  s there was  Freaks and Geeks  and  My So Called Life   and their characters  Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase  I mean  the whole premise of the shows were just them trying to figure themselves out  basically  but those shows only lasted a season each  and I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since. So this is a scientific diagram of my brain    Laughter    around the time when I was  when I started watching those TV shows. I was ending middle school  starting high school    I'm a sophomore now   and I was trying to reconcile all of these differences that you're told you can't be when you're growing up as a girl. You can't be smart and pretty. You can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion. You can't care about clothes if it's not for the sake of what other people  usually men  will think of you. So I was trying to figure all that out  and I felt a little confused  and I said so on my blog  and I said that I wanted to start a website for teenage girls that was not this kind of one dimensional strong character empowerment thing because I think one thing that can be very alienating about a misconception of feminism is that girls then think that to be a feminist  they have to live up to being perfectly consistent in your beliefs  never being insecure  never having doubts  having all of the answers. And this is not true  and  actually  reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling became easier once I understood that feminism was not a rulebook but a discussion  a conversation  a process  and this is a spread from a zine that I made last year when I    I mean  I think I've let myself go a bit on the illustration front since. But  yeah. So I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication for teenage girls and ask people to submit their writing  their photography  whatever  to be a member of our staff. I got about       emails. My editorial director and I went through them and put together a staff of people  and we launched last September. And this is an excerpt from my first editor's letter  where I say that Rookie  we don't have all the answers  we're still figuring it out too  but the point is not to give girls the answers  and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves  but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission  they can ask their own questions  find their own answers  all of that  and Rookie  I think we've been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out. So I'm not saying   Be like us   and  We're perfect role models   because we're not  but we just want to help represent girls in a way that shows those different dimensions. I mean  we have articles called  On Taking Yourself Seriously  How to Not Care What People Think of You   but we also have articles like  oops    I'm figuring it out  Ha ha.  Laughter  If you use that  you can get away with anything. We also have articles called  How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes.  So all of that being said  I still really appreciate those characters in movies and articles like that on our site  that aren't just about being totally powerful  maybe finding your acceptance with yourself and self esteem and your flaws and how you accept those. So what I you to take away from my talk  the lesson of all of this  is to just be Stevie Nicks. Like  that's all you have to do.  Laughter  Because my favorite thing about her  other than  like  everything  is that she is very    has always been unapologetically present on stage  and unapologetic about her flaws and about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings and she makes you listen to them and think about them  and yeah  so please be Stevie Nicks. Thank you.  Applause  Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk  I was really chuckled  because  you see  my father's name was Ted  and much of my life  especially my musical life  is really a talk that I'm still having with him  or the part of me that he continues to be. Now Ted was a New Yorker  an all around theater guy  and he was a self taught illustrator and musician. He didn't read a note  and he was profoundly hearing impaired. Yet  he was my greatest teacher. Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids  his understanding of music was profound. And for him  it wasn't so much the way the music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you. And he did a painting of this experience  which he called  In the Realm of Music.  Now Ted entered this realm every day by improvising in a sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this. But he was tough when it came to music. He said   There are only two things that matter in music  what and how. And the thing about classical music  that what and how  it's inexhaustible.  That was his passion for the music. Both my parents really loved it. They didn't know all that much about it  but they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them. And I think inspired by that memory  it's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as I can  sort of pass it on through whatever means. And how people get this music  how it comes into their lives  really fascinates me. One day in New York  I was on the street and I saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants. And a tough  slouchy kid got up to bat  and he took a swing and really connected. And he watched the ball fly for a second  and then he went   Dah dadaratatatah. Brah dada dadadadah.  And he ran around the bases. And I thought  go figure. How did this piece of   th century Austrian aristocratic entertainment turn into the victory crow of this New York kid  How was that passed on  How did he get to hear Mozart  Well when it comes to classical music  there's an awful lot to pass on  much more than Mozart  Beethoven or Tchiakovsky. Because classical music is an unbroken living tradition that goes back over       years. And every one of those years has had something unique and powerful to say to us about what it's like to be alive. Now the raw material of it  of course  is just the music of everyday life. It's all the anthems and dance crazes and ballads and marches. But what classical music does is to distill all of these musics down  to condense them to their absolute essence  and from that essence create a new language  a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly about who we really are. It's a language that's still evolving. Now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of  like concertos and symphonies  but even the most ambitious masterpiece can have as its central mission to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment    like this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto. It's so simple  so evocative. So many emotions seem to be inside of it. Yet  of course  like all music  it's essentially not about anything. It's just a design of pitches and silence and time. And the pitches  the notes  as you know  are just vibrations. They're locations in the spectrum of sound. And whether we call them     per second  A  or        B flat    trust me  that's right    they're just phenomena. But the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena is complex and emotional and not totally understood. And the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries  as have our preferences for them. So for example  in the   th century  people liked pieces that ended like this. And in the   th century  it was more like this. And in the   st century ... Now your   st century ears are quite happy with this last chord  even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room. And the reason you like it is because you've inherited  whether you knew it or not  centuries worth of changes in musical theory  practice and fashion. And in classical music we can follow these changes very  very accurately because of the music's powerful silent partner  the way it's been passed on  notation. Now the impulse to notate  or  more exactly I should say  encode music has been with us for a very long time. In     B.C.  a man named Sekulos wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in the notational system of the Greeks. And a thousand years later  this impulse to notate took an entirely different form. And you can see how this happened in these excerpts from the Christmas mass  Puer Natus est nobis    For Us is Born.  In the   th century  little squiggles were used just to indicate the general shape of the tune. And in the   th century  a line was drawn  like a musical horizon line  to better pinpoint the pitch's location. And then in the   th century  more lines and new shapes of notes locked in the concept of the tune exactly  and that led to the kind of notation we have today. Well notation not only passed the music on  notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely  because it enabled the musicians to imagine music on a much vaster scale. Now inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded  saved  considered  prioritized  made into intricate designs. And from this moment  classical music became what it most essentially is  a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature  instinct and intelligence. And there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition. Now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move  but a composer is considering all possible moves  testing them out  prioritizing them out  until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design of ultimate and enduring coolness. Now some of the greatest composers  like Bach  were combinations of these two things. Bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master. Mozart was the same way. But every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason  instinct and intelligence. And every musical era had different priorities of these things  different things to pass on  different 'whats' and 'hows'. So in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big 'what' was to praise God. And by the     s  music was being written that tried to mirror God's mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky. The 'how' was a style called polyphony  music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planets seemed to move in Ptolemy's geocentric universe. This was truly the music of the spheres. This is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known. And perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity meant that something new had to happen    a radical new move  which in      is what did happen. Ah  wicked  cruel fate  Ah  baleful stars  Ah  avaricious heaven  MTT  This  of course  was the birth of opera  and its development put music on a radical new course. The what now was not to mirror the mind of God  but to follow the emotion turbulence of man. And the how was harmony  stacking up the pitches to form chords. And the chords  it turned out  were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions. And the basic chords were the ones we still have with us  the triads  either the major one  which we think is happy  or the minor one  which we perceive as sad. But what's the actual difference between these two chords  It's just these two notes in the middle. It's either E natural  and     vibrations per second  or E flat  at    . So the big difference between human happiness and sadness     freakin' vibrations. So you can see in a system like this there was enormous subtle potential of representing human emotions. And in fact  as man began to understand more his complex and ambivalent nature  harmony grew more complex to reflect it. Turns out it was capable of expressing emotions beyond the ability of words. Now with all this possibility  classical music really took off. It's the time in which the big forms began to arise. And the effects of technology began to be felt also  because printing put music  the scores  the codebooks of music  into the hands of performers everywhere. And new and improved instruments made the age of the virtuoso possible. This is when those big forms arose    the symphonies  the sonatas  the concertos. And in these big architectures of time  composers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime. A piece like Beethoven's Fifth basically witnessing how it was possible for him to go from sorrow and anger  over the course of a half an hour  step by exacting step of his route  to the moment when he could make it across to joy. And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues  like gripping ones of culture  such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality. But whatever direction the music took  one thing until recently was always the same  and that was when the musicians stopped playing  the music stopped. Now this moment so fascinates me. I find it such a profound one. What happens when the music stops  Where does it go  What's left  What sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance  Is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude  And how might that change their lives  To me this is the intimate  personal side of music. It's the passing on part. It's the 'why' part of it. And to me that's the most essential of all. Mostly it's been a person to person thing  a teacher student  performer audience thing  and then around      came this new technology that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally created a new and miraculous way of passing things on  albeit an impersonal one. People could now hear music all the time  even though it wasn't necessary for them to play an instrument  read music or even go to concerts. And technology democratized music by making everything available. It spearheaded a cultural revolution in which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing. And technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes  using computers and synthesizers to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity beyond the means of performers and audiences. At the same time technology  by taking over the role that notation had always played  shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side. The culture in which we live now is awash with music of improvisation that's been sliced  diced  layered and  God knows  distributed and sold. What's the long term effect of this on us or on music  Nobody knows. The question remains  What happens when the music stops  What sticks with people  Now that we have unlimited access to music  what does stick with us  Well let me show you a story of what I mean by  really sticking with us.  I was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home  and I spied a very shaky old man making his way across the room on a walker. He came over to a piano that was there  and he balanced himself and began playing something like this. And he said something like   Me ... boy ... symphony ... Beethoven.  And I suddenly got it  and I said   Friend  by any chance are you trying to play this   And he said   Yes  yes. I was a little boy. The symphony  Isaac Stern  the concerto  I heard it.  And I thought  my God  how much must this music mean to this man that he would get himself out of his bed  across the room to recover the memory of this music that  after everything else in his life is sloughing away  still means so much to him  Well  that's why I take every performance so seriously  why it matters to me so much. I never know who might be there  who might be absorbing it and what will happen to it in their life. But now I'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possible of sharing this music. That's what drives my interest in projects like the TV series  Keeping Score  with the San Francisco Symphony that looks at the backstories of music  and working with the young musicians at the New World Symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education. And of course  the New World Symphony led to the YouTube Symphony and projects on the internet that reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world. And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype. There's just a role here for so many people    teachers  parents  performers    to be explorers together. Sure  the big events attract a lot of attention  but what really matters is what goes on every single day. We need your perspectives  your curiosity  your voices. And it excites me now to meet people who are hikers  chefs  code writers  taxi drivers  people I never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on. You don't need to worry about knowing anything. If you're curious  if you have a capacity for wonder  if you're alive  you know all that you need to know. You can start anywhere. Ramble a bit. Follow traces. Get lost. Be surprised  amused inspired. All that 'what'  all that 'how' is out there waiting for you to discover its 'why'  to dive in and pass it on. Thank you. I love my food. And I love information. My children usually tell me that one of those passions is a little more apparent than the other. But what I want to do in the next eight minutes or so is to take you through how those passions developed  the point in my life when the two passions merged  the journey of learning that took place from that point. And one idea I want to leave you with today is what would would happen differently in your life if you saw information the way you saw food  I was born in Calcutta    a family where my father and his father before him were journalists  and they wrote magazines in the English language. That was the family business. And as a result of that  I grew up with books everywhere around the house. And I mean books everywhere around the house. And that's actually a shop in Calcutta  but it's a place where we like our books. In fact  I've got        of them now and no Kindle in sight. But growing up as a child with the books around everywhere  with people to talk to about those books  this wasn't a sort of slightly learned thing. By the time I was     I had a deep passion for books. It wasn't the only passion I had. I was a South Indian brought up in Bengal. And two of the things about Bengal  they like their savory dishes and they like their sweets. So by the time I grew up  again  I had a well established passion for food. Now I was growing up in the late '  s and early '  s  and there were a number of other passions I was also interested in  but these two were the ones that differentiated me. And then life was fine  dandy. Everything was okay  until I got to about the age of     and I went to a movie called  Short Circuit.  Oh  some of you have seen it. And apparently it's being remade right now and it's going to be coming out next year. It's the story of this experimental robot which got electrocuted and found a life. And as it ran  this thing was saying   Give me input. Give me input.  And I suddenly realized that for a robot both information as well as food were the same thing. Energy came to it in some form or shape  data came to it in some form or shape. And I began to think  I wonder what it would be like to start imagining myself as if energy and information were the two things I had as input    as if food and information were similar in some form or shape. I started doing some research then  and this was the    year journey  and started finding out that actually human beings as primates have far smaller stomachs than should be the size for our body weight and far larger brains. And as I went to research that even further  I got to a point where I discovered something called the expensive tissue hypothesis. That actually for a given body mass of a primate the metabolic rate was static. What changed was the balance of the tissues available. And two of the most expensive tissues in our human body are nervous tissue and digestive tissue. And what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis that was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about     . It's a lady named Leslie Aiello. And the paper then suggested that you traded one for the other. If you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large  you had to live with a smaller gut. That then set me off completely to say  Okay  these two are connected. So I looked at the cultivation of information as if it were food and said  So we were hunter gathers of information. We moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information. Does that really explain what we're seeing with the intellectual property battles nowadays  Because those people who were hunter gatherers in origin wanted to be free and roam and pick up information as they wanted  and those that were in the business of farming information wanted to build fences around it  create ownership and wealth and structure and settlement. So there was always going to be a tension within that. And everything I saw in the cultivation said there were huge fights amongst the foodies between the cultivators and the hunter gatherers. And this is happening here. When I moved to preparation  this same thing was true  expect that there were two schools. One group of people said you can distill your information  you can extract value  separate it and serve it up  while another group turned around and said no  no you can ferment it. You bring it all together and mash it up and the value emerges that way. The same is again true with information. But consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable. Because what I began to see then was there were so many different ways people would consume this. They'd buy it from the shop as raw ingredients. Do you cook it  Do you have it served to you  Do you go to a restaurant  The same is true every time as I started thinking about information. The analogies were getting crazy    that information had sell by dates  that people had misused information that wasn't dated properly and could really make an effect on the stock market  on corporate values  etc. And by this time I was hooked. And this is about    years into this process. And I began to start thinking of myself as we start having mash ups of fact and fiction  docu dramas  mockumentaries  whatever you call it. Are we going to reach the stage where information has a percentage for fact associated with it  We start labeling information for the fact percentage  Are we going to start looking at what happens when your information source is turned off  as a famine  Which brings me to the final element of this. Clay Shirky once stated that there is no such animal as information overload  there is only filter failure. I put it to you that information  if viewed from the point of food  is never a production issue  you never speak of food overload. Fundamentally it's a consumption issue. And we have to start thinking about how we create diets within ourselves  exercise within ourselves  to have the faculties to be able to deal with information  to have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly. In fact  when I saw  Supersize Me   I starting thinking of saying  What would happen if an individual had    days nonstop Fox News  Would there be time to be able to work with it  So you start really understanding that you can have diseases  toxins  a need to balance your diet  and once you start looking  and from that point on  everything I have done in terms of the consumption of information  the production of information  the preparation of information  I've looked at from the viewpoint of food. It has probably not helped my waistline any because I like practicing on both sides. But I'd like to leave you with just that question  If you began to think of all the information that you consume the way you think of food  what would you do differently  Thank you very much for your time. I'm a very lucky person. I've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful Earth and the people and creatures that live on it. And my passion was inspired at the age of seven  when my parents first took me to Morocco  at the edge of the Sahara Desert. Now imagine a little Brit somewhere that wasn't cold and damp like home. What an amazing experience. And it made me want to explore more. So as a filmmaker  I've been from one end of the Earth to the other trying to get the perfect shot and to capture animal behavior never seen before. And what's more  I'm really lucky  because I get to share that with millions of people worldwide. Now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step. You might think that it's quite hard to find new stories and new subjects  but new technology is changing the way we can film. It's enabling us to get fresh  new images and tell brand new stories. In Nature's Great Events  a series for the BBC that I did with David Attenborough  we wanted to do just that. Images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar. You see them all the time  you think. But there's a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see and had never been filmed. So what we did  we went to Alaska  which is where the grizzlies rely on really high  almost inaccessible  mountain slopes for their denning. And the only way to film that is a shoot from the air. thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep. There is nothing to eat up here  but the conditions were ideal for hibernation. Lots of snow in which to dig a den. To find food  mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast  where the snow will already be melting. But getting down can be a challenge for small cubs. These mountains are dangerous places  but ultimately the fate of these bear families  and indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific  depends on the salmon. KB  I love that shot. I always get goosebumps every time I see it. That was filmed from a helicopter using a gyro stabilized camera. And it's a wonderful bit of gear  because it's like having a flying tripod  crane and dolly all rolled into one. But technology alone isn't enough. To really get the money shots  it's down to being in the right place at the right time. And that sequence was especially difficult. The first year we got nothing. We had to go back the following year  all the way back to the remote parts of Alaska. And we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks. And eventually we got lucky. The cloud lifted  the wind was still  and even the bear showed up. And we managed to get that magic moment. For a filmmaker  new technology is an amazing tool  but the other thing that really  really excites me is when new species are discovered. Now  when I heard about one animal  I knew we had to get it for my next series  Untamed Americas  for National Geographic. In       a new species of bat was discovered in the cloud forests of Ecuador. And what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery of what pollinated a unique flower. It depends solely on the bat. Now  the series hasn't even aired yet  so you're the very first to see this. See what you think. A pool of delicious nectar lies at the bottom of each flower's long flute. But how to reach it  Necessity is the mother of evolution. This two and a half inch bat has a three and a half inch tongue  the longest relative to body length of any mammal in the world. If human  he'd have a nine foot tongue. KB  What a tongue. We filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower and using a camera that could slow the action by    times. So imagine how quick that thing is in real life. Now people often ask me   Where's your favorite place on the planet   And the truth is I just don't have one. There are so many wonderful places. But some locations draw you back time and time again. And one remote location    I first went there as a backpacker  I've been back several times for filming  most recently for Untamed Americas    it's the Altiplano in the high Andes of South America  and it's the most otherworldly place I know. But at        feet  it's tough. It's freezing cold  and that thin air really gets you. Sometimes it's hard to breathe  especially carrying all the heavy filming equipment. And that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover. But the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens with amazing clarity. Have a look. between Chile and Bolivia  the Andes completely change. It's called the Altiplano  or  high plains     a place of extremes and extreme contrasts. Where deserts freeze and waters boil. More like Mars than Earth  it seems just as hostile to life. The stars themselves    at        feet  the dry  thin air makes for perfect stargazing. Some of the world's astronomers have telescopes nearby. But just looking up with the naked eye  you really don't need one. KB  Thank you so much for letting me share some images of our magnificent  wonderful Earth. Thank you for letting me share that with you. I'd like to invite you to close your eyes. Imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home. I'd like you to notice the color of the door  the material that it's made out of. Now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles. They are competing in a naked bicycle race  and they are headed straight for your front door. I need you to actually see this. They are pedaling really hard  they're sweaty  they're bouncing around a lot. And they crash straight into the front door of your home. Bicycles fly everywhere  wheels roll past you  spokes end up in awkward places. Step over the threshold of your door into your foyer  your hallway  whatever's on the other side  and appreciate the quality of the light. The light is shining down on Cookie Monster. Cookie Monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse. It's a talking horse. You can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose. You can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he's about to shovel into his mouth. Walk past him. Walk past him into your living room. In your living room  in full imaginative broadband  picture Britney Spears. She is scantily clad  she's dancing on your coffee table  and she's singing  Hit Me Baby One More Time.  And then  follow me into your kitchen. In your kitchen  the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road  and out of your oven are coming towards you Dorothy  the Tin Man  the Scarecrow and the Lion from  The Wizard of Oz   hand in hand  skipping straight towards you. Okay. Open your eyes. I want to tell you about a very bizarre contest that is held every spring in New York City. It's called the United States Memory Championship. And I had gone to cover this contest a few years back as a science journalist  expecting  I guess  that this was going to be like the Superbowl of savants. This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies  widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep. They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers  looking at them just once. They were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers. They were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes. They were competing to see who could memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest. I was like  this is unbelievable. These people must be freaks of nature. And I started talking to a few of the competitors. This is a guy called Ed Cook  who had come over from England  where he had one of the best trained memories. And I said to him   Ed  when did you realize that you were a savant   And Ed was like   I'm not a savant. In fact  I have just an average memory. Everybody who competes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory. We've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques  techniques invented       years ago in Greece  the same techniques that Cicero had used to memorize his speeches  that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books.  And I said   Whoa. How come I never heard of this before   And we were standing outside the competition hall  and Ed  who is a wonderful  brilliant  but somewhat eccentric English guy  says to me   Josh  you're an American journalist. Do you know Britney Spears   I'm like   What  No. Why    Because I really want to teach Britney Spears how to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards on U.S. national television. It will prove to the world that anybody can do this.  I was like   Well  I'm not Britney Spears  but maybe you could teach me. I mean  you've got to start somewhere  right   And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me. I ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory  but also investigating it  trying to understand how it works  why it sometimes doesn't work  and what its potential might be. And I met a host of really interesting people. This is a guy called E.P. He's an amnesic who had  very possibly  the worst memory in the world. His memory was so bad  that he didn't even remember he had a memory problem  which is amazing. And he was this incredibly tragic figure  but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are. At the other end of the spectrum  I met this guy. This is Kim Peek  he was the basis for Dustin Hoffman's character in the movie  Rain Man.  We spent an afternoon together in the Salt Lake City Public Library memorizing phone books  which was scintillating. And I went back and I read a whole host of memory treatises  treatises written       plus years ago in Latin  in antiquity  and then later  in the Middle Ages. And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff. One of the really interesting things that I learned is that once upon a time  this idea of having a trained  disciplined  cultivated memory was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today. Once upon a time  people invested in their memories  in laboriously furnishing their minds. Over the last few millenia  we've invented a series of technologies    from the alphabet  to the scroll  to the codex  the printing press  photography  the computer  the smartphone    that have made it progressively easier and easier for us to externalize our memories  for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity. These technologies have made our modern world possible  but they've also changed us. They've changed us culturally  and I would argue that they've changed us cognitively. Having little need to remember anymore  it sometimes seems like we've forgotten how. One of the last places on Earth where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained  disciplined  cultivated memory  is at this totally singular memory contest. It's actually not that singular  there are contests held all over the world. And I was fascinated  I wanted to know how do these guys do it. A few years back a group of researchers at University College London brought a bunch of memory champions into the lab. They wanted to know  Do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally  anatomically different from the rest of ours  The answer was no. Are they smarter than the rest of us  They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests  and the answer was  not really. There was  however  one really interesting and telling difference between the brains of the memory champions and the control subjects that they were comparing them to. When they put these guys in an fMRI machine  scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers and people's faces and pictures of snowflakes  they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain than everyone else. Of note  they were using  or they seemed to be using  a part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation. Why  And is there something that the rest of us can learn from this  The sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where  every year  somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly  and then the rest of the field has to play catch up. This is my friend Ben Pridmore  three time world memory champion. On his desk in front of him are    shuffled packs of playing cards that he is about to try to memorize in one hour  using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered. He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of       random binary digits in half an hour. Yeah. And while there are a whole host of ways of remembering stuff in these competitions  everything  all of the techniques that are being used  ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as  elaborative encoding.  And it's well illustrated by a nifty paradox known as the Baker baker paradox  which goes like this  If I tell two people to remember the same word  if I say to you   Remember that there is a guy named Baker.  That's his name. And I say to you   Remember that there is a guy who is a baker.  Okay  And I come back to you at some point later on  and I say   Do you remember that word that I told you a while back  Do you remember what it was   The person who was told his name is Baker is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is a baker. Same word  different amount of remembering  that's weird. What's going on here  Well  the name Baker doesn't actually mean anything to you. It is entirely untethered from all of the other memories floating around in your skull. But the common noun  baker     we know bakers. Bakers wear funny white hats. Bakers have flour on their hands. Bakers smell good when they come home from work. Maybe we even know a baker. And when we first hear that word  we start putting these associational hooks into it  that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date. The entire art of what is going on in these memory contests  and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life  is figuring out ways to transform capital B Bakers into lower case B bakers    to take information that is lacking in context  in significance  in meaning  and transform it in some way  so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have in your mind. One of the more elaborate techniques for doing this dates back       years to Ancient Greece. It came to be known as the memory palace. The story behind its creation goes like this  There was a poet called Simonides  who was attending a banquet. He was actually the hired entertainment  because back then  if you wanted to throw a really slamming party  you didn't hire a D.J.  you hired a poet. And he stands up  delivers his poem from memory  walks out the door  and at the moment he does  the banquet hall collapses. Kills everybody inside. It doesn't just kill everybody  it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition. Nobody can say who was inside  nobody can say where they were sitting. The bodies can't be properly buried. It's one tragedy compounding another. Simonides  standing outside  the sole survivor amid the wreckage  closes his eyes and has this realization  which is that in his mind's eye  he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting. And he takes the relatives by the hand  and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage. What Simonides figured out at that moment  is something that I think we all kind of intuitively know  which is that  as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers  and word for word instructions from our colleagues  we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories. If I asked you to recount the first    words of the story that I just told you about Simonides  chances are you would have a tough time with it. But  I would wager that if I asked you to recall who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse in your foyer right now  you would be able to see that. The idea behind the memory palace is to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye  and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember    the crazier  weirder  more bizarre  funnier  raunchier  stinkier the image is  the more unforgettable it's likely to be. This is advice that goes back       plus years to the earliest Latin memory treatises. So how does this work  Let's say that you've been invited to TED center stage to give a speech  and you want to do it from memory  and you want to do it the way that Cicero would have done it  if he had been invited to TEDxRome       years ago. What you might do is picture yourself at the front door of your house. And you'd come up with some sort of crazy  ridiculous  unforgettable image  to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest. And then you'd go inside your house  and you would see an image of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed. And that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend Ed Cook. And then you'd see an image of Britney Spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell. And you'd go into your kitchen  and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year  and you'd have some friends to help you remember that. This is how Roman orators memorized their speeches    not word for word  which is just going to screw you up  but topic for topic. In fact  the phrase  topic sentence     that comes from the Greek word  topos   which means  place.  That's a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric in these sorts of spatial terms. The phrase  in the first place   that's like  in the first place of your memory palace.  I thought this was just fascinating  and I got really into it. And I went to a few more of these memory contests  and I had this notion that I might write something longer about this subculture of competitive memorizers. But there was a problem. The problem was that a memory contest is a pathologically boring event. Truly  it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the SATs    I mean  the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts massaging their temples. And I'm a journalist  I need something to write about. I know that there's incredible stuff happening in these people's minds  but I don't have access to it. And I realized  if I was going to tell this story  I needed to walk in their shoes a little bit. And so I started trying to spend    or    minutes every morning  before I sat down with my New York Times  just trying to remember something. Maybe it was a poem  maybe it was names from an old yearbook that I bought at a flea market. And I found that this was shockingly fun. I never would have expected that. It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory. What you're doing  is you're trying to get better and better at creating  at dreaming up  these utterly ludicrous  raunchy  hilarious  and hopefully unforgettable images in your mind's eye. And I got pretty into it. This is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer's training kit. It's a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over except for two small pinholes  because distraction is the competitive memorizer's greatest enemy. I ended up coming back to that same contest that I had covered a year earlier  and I had this notion that I might enter it  sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism. It'd make  I thought  maybe a nice epilogue to all my research. Problem was  the experiment went haywire. I won the contest    which really wasn't supposed to happen. Now  it is nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers and shopping lists  but it's actually kind of beside the point. These are just tricks. They work because they're based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work. And you don't have to be building memory palaces or memorizing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works. We often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift  but that is not the case. Great memories are learned. At the most basic level  we remember when we pay attention. We remember when we are deeply engaged. We remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience  and figure out why it is meaningful to us  why it is significant  why it's colorful  when we're able to transform it in some way that makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds  when we're able to transform Bakers into bakers. The memory palace  these memory techniques    they're just shortcuts. In fact  they're not even really shortcuts. They work because they make you work. They force a kind of depth of processing  a kind of mindfulness  that most of us don't normally walk around exercising. But there actually are no shortcuts. This is how stuff is made memorable. And I think if there's one thing that I want to leave you with  it's what E.P.  the amnesic who couldn't even remember he had a memory problem  left me with  which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories. How much are we willing to lose from our already short lives  by losing ourselves in our Blackberries  our iPhones  by not paying attention to the human being across from us who is talking with us  by being so lazy that we're not willing to process deeply  I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capacities latent in all of us. But if you want to live a memorable life  you have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember. Thank you. So what I want to try to do is tell a quick story about a     page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it. But to start it probably helps to have an understanding of what a     page actually is. The     page is that. It's that broken experience on the Web. It's effectively the default page when you ask a website for something and it can't find it. And it serves you the     page. It's inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it. And I just want you to think a little bit about  remember for yourself  it's annoying when you hit this thing. Because it's the feeling of a broken relationship. And that's where it's actually also interesting to think about  where does     come from  It's from a family of errors actually    a whole set of relationship errors  which  when I started digging into them  it looks almost like a checklist for a sex therapist or a couples counselor. You sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey. Yes. But these things are everywhere. They're on sites big  they're on sites small. This is a global experience. What a     page tells you is that you fell through the cracks. And that's not a good experience when you're used to experiences like this. You can get on your Kinect and you can have unicorns dancing and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone. A     page is not what you're looking for. You get that  and it's like a slap in the face. Trying to think about how a     felt  and it would be like if you went to Starbucks and there's the guy behind the counter and you're over there and there's no skim milk. And you say   Hey  could you bring the skim milk   And they walk out from behind the counter and they've got no pants on. And you're like   Oh  I didn't want to see that.  That's the     feeling. I mean  I've heard about that. So where this comes into play and why this is important is I head up a technology incubator  and we had eight startups sitting around there. And those startups are focused on what they are  not what they're not  until one day Athletepath  which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes  found this video. Crowd  Whoa  Renny Gleeson  You just ... no  he's not okay. They took that video and they embedded it in their     page and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place. Because finally there was a page that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a    . So this turned into a contest. Dailypath that offers inspiration put inspiration on their     page. Stayhound  which helps you find pet sitters through your social network  commiserated with your pet. Each one of them found this. It turned into a    hour contest. At      the next day  we gave out      in cash. And what they learned was that those little things  done right  actually matter  and that well designed moments can build brands. So you take a look out in the real world  and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself. You can type in an URL and put in a     and these will pop. This is one that commiserates with you. This is one that blames you. This is one that I loved. This is an error page  but what if this error page was also an opportunity  So it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be. Because back to the whole relationship issue  what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you're not  or it can remind me of why I should love you. Thank you. Gotcha. Mosquitos. I hate them. Don't you  That awful buzzing sound at night around your ears that drives you absolutely crazy  Knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood  That's awful  right  In fact  there's only one good thing I can think of when it gets to mosquitos. When they fly into our bedroom at night  they prefer to bite my wife. But that's fascinating  right  Why does she receive more bites than I do  And the answer is smell  the smell of her body. And since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin that either attract or repel mosquitos  some of us are just more attractive than others. So my wife smells nicer than I do  or I just stink more than she does. Either way  mosquitos find us in the dark by sniffing us out. They smell us. And during my Ph.D  I wanted to know exactly what chemicals from our skin mosquitos used  African malarial mosquitos use to track us down at night. And there's a whole range of compounds that they do use. And this was not going to be an easy task. And therefore  we set up various experiments. Why did we set up these experiments  Because half the world's population runs the risk of contracting a killer disease like malaria through a simple mosquito bite. Every    seconds  somewhere on this planet  a child dies of malaria  and Paul Levy this morning  he was talking about the metaphor of the     crashing into the United States. Well  in Africa  we have the equivalent of seven jumbo    s crashing every day. But perhaps if we can attract these mosquitos to traps  bait it with our smell  we may be able to stop transmission of disease. Now solving this puzzle was not an easy thing  because we produce hundreds of different chemicals on the skin  but we undertook some remarkable experiments that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed. First  we observed that not all mosquito species bite on the same part of the body. Strange. So we set up an experiment whereby we put a naked volunteer in a large cage  and in that cage we released mosquitos to see where they were biting on the body of that person. And we found some remarkable differences. On the left here you see the bites by the Dutch malarial mosquito on this person. They had a very strong preference for biting on the face. In contrast  the African malarial mosquito had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person  and that of course we should have known all along because they're called mosqui toes  you see   Laughter  That's right.  Applause  And so we started focusing on the smell of feet  on the smell of human feet  until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature that said that cheese smells after feet rather than the reverse. Think of it. And this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment. We tried  with a tiny little piece of Limburger cheese  which smells badly after feet  to attract African malaria mosquitos. And you know what  It worked. In fact  it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese that we're using in Tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitos than humans. Limburg  be proud of your cheese  as it is now used in the fight against malaria. That's the cheese  just to show you. My second story is remarkable as well. It's about man's best friend. It's about dogs. And I will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria. One of the best ways of killing mosquitos is not to wait until they fly around like adults and bite people and transmit disease. It's to kill them when they're still in the water as larvae. Why  Because they are just like the CIA. In that pool of water  these larvae are concentrated. They're all together there. They are immobile. They can't escape from that water. They can't fly. And they're accessible. You can actually walk up to that pool and you can kill them there  right  So the problem that we face with this is that  throughout the landscape  all these pools of water with the larvae  they are scattered all over the place  which makes it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides. And last year we thought very  very hard  how can we resolve this problem  Until we realized that just like us  we have a unique smell  that mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell. And so we set up another crazy experiment  because we collected the smell of these larvae  put it on pieces of cloth  and then did something very remarkable. Here we have a bar with four holes  and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole. Ooh  that was very quick. And then you see the dog. It's called Tweed. It's a border collie. He's examining these holes  and now he's got it already. He's going back to check the control holes again  but he's coming back to the first one  and now he's locking into that smell  which means that now we can use dogs with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitos in the field  and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria. This lady is Ellen van der Zweep. She's one of the best dog trainers in the world  and she believes that we can do a lot more. Since we also know that people that carry malaria parasites smell different compared to people that are uninfected  she's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite. That means that in a population where malaria has gone down all the way  and there's few people remaining with parasites  that the dogs can find these people  we can treat them with anti malarial drugs  and give the final blow to malaria. Man's best friend in the fight against malaria. My third story is perhaps even more remarkable  and  I should say  has never been shown to the public until today. Yeah. It's a crazy story  but I believe it's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge against mosquitos ever. In fact  people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitos. And the question of course is  what would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitos  And the answer I have right here in my pocket  if I get it. It's a tablet  a simple tablet  and when I take it with water  it does miracles. Thank you. Now let me show you how this works. Here in this box I have a cage with several hundred hungry female mosquitos that I'm just about to release.  Laughter  Just kidding  just kidding. What I'm going to show you is I'm gonna stick my arm into it and I will show you how quickly they will bite. Here we go. Don't worry  I do this all the time in the lab. There we go. Okay. Now  on the video  on the video here  I'm going to show you exactly the same thing  except that what I'm showing you on the video happened one hour after I took the tablet. Have a look. That doesn't work. Okay. Sorry about that. I'm sticking in my arm  I'm giving them a big juicy blood meal  I'm shaking them off  and we follow them through time to see these mosquitos get very  very sick indeed  here shown in fast motion  and three hours later what we see at the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitos  very dead mosquitos  and I'm going to say  ladies and gentlemen  we have swapped the cards with mosquitos. They don't kill us. We kill them. Now    Laughter    Maastricht  be prepared. Now think of what we can do with this. We can actually use this to contain outbreaks of mosquito born diseases  of epidemics  right  And better still  imagine what would happen if  in a very large area  everyone would take these drugs  this drug  for just three weeks. That would give us an opportunity to actually eliminate malaria as a disease. So cheese  dogs and a pill to kill mosquitos. That's the kind of out of the box science that I love doing  for the betterment of mankind  but especially for her  so that she can grow up in a world without malaria. Thank you.  Applause  I'm going to talk to you about optimism    or more precisely  the optimism bias. It's a cognitive illusion that we've been studying in my lab for the past few years  and    percent of us have it. It's our tendency to overestimate our likelihood of experiencing good events in our lives and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing bad events. So we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer  being in a car accident. We overestimate our longevity  our career prospects. In short  we're more optimistic than realistic  but we are oblivious to the fact. Take marriage for example. In the Western world  divorce rates are about    percent. That means that out of five married couples  two will end up splitting their assets. But when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce  they estimate it at zero percent. And even divorce lawyers  who should really know better  hugely underestimate their own likelihood of divorce. So it turns out that optimists are not less likely to divorce  but they are more likely to remarry. In the words of Samuel Johnson   Remarriage is the triumph of hope over experience.  So if we're married  we're more likely to have kids. And we all think our kids will be especially talented. This  by the way  is my two year old nephew  Guy. And I just want to make it absolutely clear that he's a really bad example of the optimism bias  because he is in fact uniquely talented. And I'm not alone. Out of four British people  three said that they were optimistic about the future of their own families. That's    percent. But only    percent said that they thought families in general are doing better than a few generations ago. And this is a really important point  because we're optimistic about ourselves  we're optimistic about our kids  we're optimistic about our families  but we're not so optimistic about the guy sitting next to us  and we're somewhat pessimistic about the fate of our fellow citizens and the fate of our country. But private optimism about our own personal future remains persistent. And it doesn't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay  but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so. Now I'm a scientist  I do experiments. So to show you what I mean  I'm going to do an experiment here with you. So I'm going to give you a list of abilities and characteristics  and I want you to think for each of these abilities where you stand relative to the rest of the population. The first one is getting along well with others. Who here believes they're at the bottom    percent  Okay  that's about    people out of      . Who believes they're at the top    percent  That's most of us here. Okay  now do the same for your driving ability. How interesting are you  How attractive are you  How honest are you  And finally  how modest are you  So most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities. Now this is statistically impossible. We can't all be better than everyone else. But if we believe we're better than the other guy  well that means that we're more likely to get that promotion  to remain married  because we're more social  more interesting. And it's a global phenomenon. The optimism bias has been observed in many different countries    in Western cultures  in non Western cultures  in females and males  in kids  in the elderly. It's quite widespread. But the question is  is it good for us  So some people say no. Some people say the secret to happiness is low expectations. I think the logic goes something like this  If we don't expect greatness  if we don't expect to find love and be healthy and successful  well we're not going to be disappointed when these things don't happen. And if we're not disappointed when good things don't happen  and we're pleasantly surprised when they do  we will be happy. So it's a very good theory  but it turns out to be wrong for three reasons. Number one  Whatever happens  whether you succeed or you fail  people with high expectations always feel better. Because how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month depends on how we interpret that event. The psychologists Margaret Marshall and John Brown studied students with high and low expectations. And they found that when people with high expectations succeed  they attribute that success to their own traits.  I'm a genius  therefore I got an A  therefore I'll get an A again and again in the future.  When they failed  it wasn't because they were dumb  but because the exam just happened to be unfair. Next time they will do better. People with low expectations do the opposite. So when they failed it was because they were dumb  and when they succeeded it was because the exam just happened to be really easy. Next time reality would catch up with them. So they felt worse. Number two  Regardless of the outcome  the pure act of anticipation makes us happy. The behavioral economist George Lowenstein asked students in his university to imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity  any celebrity. Then he said   How much are you willing to pay to get a kiss from a celebrity if the kiss was delivered immediately  in three hours  in    hours  in three days  in one year  in    years  He found that the students were willing to pay the most not to get a kiss immediately  but to get a kiss in three days. They were willing to pay extra in order to wait. Now they weren't willing to wait a year or    years  no one wants an aging celebrity. But three days seemed to be the optimum amount. So why is that  Well if you get the kiss now  it's over and done with. But if you get the kiss in three days  well that's three days of jittery anticipation  the thrill of the wait. The students wanted that time to imagine where is it going to happen  how is it going to happen. Anticipation made them happy. This is  by the way  why people prefer Friday to Sunday. It's a really curious fact  because Friday is a day of work and Sunday is a day of pleasure  so you'd assume that people will prefer Sunday  but they don't. It's not because they really  really like being in the office and they can't stand strolling in the park or having a lazy brunch. We know that  because when you ask people about their ultimate favorite day of the week  surprise  surprise  Saturday comes in at first  then Friday  then Sunday. People prefer Friday because Friday brings with it the anticipation of the weekend ahead  all the plans that you have. On Sunday  the only thing you can look forward to is the work week. So optimists are people who expect more kisses in their future  more strolls in the park. And that anticipation enhances their wellbeing. In fact  without the optimism bias  we would all be slightly depressed. People with mild depression  they don't have a bias when they look into the future. They're actually more realistic than healthy individuals. But individuals with severe depression  they have a pessimistic bias. So they tend to expect the future to be worse than it ends up being. So optimism changes subjective reality. The way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it. But it also changes objective reality. It acts as a self fulfilling prophecy. And that is the third reason why lowering your expectations will not make you happy. Controlled experiments have shown that optimism is not only related to success  it leads to success. Optimism leads to success in academia and sports and politics. And maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism is health. If we expect the future to be bright  stress and anxiety are reduced. So all in all  optimism has lots of benefits. But the question that was really confusing to me was  how do we maintain optimism in the face of reality  As an neuroscientist  this was especially confusing  because according to all the theories out there  when your expectations are not met  you should alter them. But this is not what we find. We asked people to come into our lab in order to try and figure out what was going on. We asked them to estimate their likelihood of experiencing different terrible events in their lives. So  for example  what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer  And then we told them the average likelihood of someone like them to suffer these misfortunes. So cancer  for example  is about    percent. And then we asked them again   How likely are you to suffer from cancer   What we wanted to know was whether people will take the information that we gave them to change their beliefs. And indeed they did    but mostly when the information we gave them was better than what they expected. So for example  if someone said   My likelihood of suffering from cancer is about    percent   and we said   Hey  good news. The average likelihood is only    percent   the next time around they would say   Well maybe my likelihood is about    percent.  So they learned quickly and efficiently. But if someone started off saying   My average likelihood of suffering from cancer is about    percent   and we said   Hey  bad news. The average likelihood is about    percent   the next time around they would say   Yep. Still think it's about    percent.  So it's not that they didn't learn at all    they did    but much  much less than when we gave them positive information about the future. And it's not that they didn't remember the numbers that we gave them  everyone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer is about    percent and the average likelihood of divorce is about    percent. But they didn't think that those numbers were related to them. What this means is that warning signs such as these may only have limited impact. Yes  smoking kills  but mostly it kills the other guy. What I wanted to know was what was going on inside the human brain that prevented us from taking these warning signs personally. But at the same time  when we hear that the housing market is hopeful  we think   Oh  my house is definitely going to double in price.  To try and figure that out  I asked the participants in the experiment to lie in a brain imaging scanner. It looks like this. And using a method called functional MRI  we were able to identify regions in the brain that were responding to positive information. One of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus. So if someone said   My likelihood of suffering from cancer is    percent   and we said   Hey  good news. Average likelihood is    percent   the left inferior frontal gyrus would respond fiercely. And it didn't matter if you're an extreme optimist  a mild optimist or slightly pessimistic  everyone's left inferior frontal gyrus was functioning perfectly well  whether you're Barack Obama or Woody Allen. On the other side of the brain  the right inferior frontal gyrus was responding to bad news. And here's the thing  it wasn't doing a very good job. The more optimistic you were  the less likely this region was to respond to unexpected negative information. And if your brain is failing at integrating bad news about the future  you will constantly leave your rose tinted spectacles on. So we wanted to know  could we change this  Could we alter people's optimism bias by interfering with the brain activity in these regions  And there's a way for us to do that. This is my collaborator Ryota Kanai. And what he's doing is he's passing a small magnetic pulse through the skull of the participant in our study into their inferior frontal gyrus. And by doing that  he's interfering with the activity of this brain region for about half an hour. After that everything goes back to normal  I assure you. So let's see what happens. First of all  I'm going to show you the average amount of bias that we see. So if I was to test all of you now  this is the amount that you would learn more from good news relative to bad news. Now we interfere with the region that we found to integrate negative information in this task  and the optimism bias grew even larger. We made people more biased in the way that they process information. Then we interfered with the brain region that we found to integrate good news in this task  and the optimism bias disappeared. We were quite amazed by these results because we were able to eliminate a deep rooted bias in humans. And at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves  would we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits  If we could do that  would we want to take people's optimism bias away  Well I've already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias  which probably makes you want to hold onto it for dear life. But there are  of course  pitfalls  and it would be really foolish of us to ignore them. Take for example this email I recieved from a firefighter here in California. He says   Fatality investigations for firefighters often include 'We didn't think the fire was going to do that ' even when all of the available information was there to make safe decisions.  This captain is going to use our findings on the optimism bias to try to explain to the firefighters why they think the way they do  to make them acutely aware of this very optimistic bias in humans. So unrealistic optimism can lead to risky behavior  to financial collapse  to faulty planning. The British government  for example  has acknowledged that the optimism bias can make individuals more likely to underestimate the costs and durations of projects. So they have adjusted the      Olympic budget for the optimism bias. My friend who's getting married in a few weeks has done the same for his wedding budget. And by the way  when I asked him about his own likelihood of divorce  he said he was quite sure it was zero percent. So what we would really like to do  is we would like to protect ourselves from the dangers of optimism  but at the same time remain hopeful  benefiting from the many fruits of optimism. And I believe there's a way for us to do that. The key here really is knowledge. We're not born with an innate understanding of our biases. These have to be identified by scientific investigation. But the good news is that becoming aware of the optimism bias does not shatter the illusion. It's like visual illusions  in which understanding them does not make them go away. And this is good because it means we should be able to strike a balance  to come up with plans and rules to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism  but at the same time remain hopeful. I think this cartoon portrays it nicely. Because if you're one of these pessimistic penguins up there who just does not believe they can fly  you certainly never will. Because to make any kind of progress  we need to be able to imagine a different reality  and then we need to believe that that reality is possible. But if you are an extreme optimistic penguin who just jumps down blindly hoping for the best  you might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground. But if you're an optimistic penguin who believes they can fly  but then adjusts a parachute to your back just in case things don't work out exactly as you had planned  you will soar like an eagle  even if you're just a penguin. Thank you. So it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language. It has generated considerable insight in physics  in biology and economics  but not that much in the humanities and in history. I think there's a belief that it's just impossible  that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind  that you cannot measure history. But I don't think that's right. I want to show you a couple of examples why. So my collaborator Erez and I were considering the following fact  that two kings separated by centuries will speak a very different language. That's a powerful historical force. So the king of England  Alfred the Great  will use a vocabulary and grammar that is quite different from the king of hip hop  Jay Z. Now it's just the way it is. Language changes over time  and it's a powerful force. So Erez and I wanted to know more about that. So we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule  past tense conjugation. So you just add  ed  to a verb at the end to signify the past.  Today I walk. Yesterday I walked.  But some verbs are irregular.  Yesterday I thought.  Now what's interesting about that is irregular verbs between Alfred and Jay Z have become more regular. Like the verb  to wed  that you see here has become regular. So Erez and I followed the fate of over     irregular verbs through    centuries of English language  and we saw that there's actually a very simple mathematical pattern that captures this complex historical change  namely  if a verb is     times more frequent than another  it regularizes    times slower. That's a piece of history  but it comes in a mathematical wrapping. Now in some cases math can even help explain  or propose explanations for  historical forces. So here Steve Pinker and I were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries. There's actually a well known regularity to them where the number of wars that are     times deadlier is    times smaller. So there are    wars that are about as deadly as the Six Days War  but there's only four wars that are     times deadlier    like World War I. So what kind of historical mechanism can produce that  What's the origin of this  So Steve and I  through mathematical analysis  propose that there's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this  which lies in our brains. This is a very well known feature in which we perceive quantities in relative ways    quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a sound. For instance  committing        soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot. It's relatively enormous if you've already committed       soldiers previously. But it doesn't sound so much  it's not relatively enough  it won't make a difference if you've already committed         soldiers previously. So you see that because of the way we perceive quantities  as the war drags on  the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties will increase not linearly    like                           but exponentially            later         later       . And so that explains this pattern that we've seen before. So here mathematics is able to link a well known feature of the individual mind with a long term historical pattern that unfolds over centuries and across continents. So these types of examples  today there are just a few of them  but I think in the next decade they will become commonplace. The reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at a very fast pace. So there's about     million books that have been written since the dawn of time. Companies like Google have digitized many of them    above    million actually. And when the stuff of history is available in digital form  it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis to very quickly and very conveniently review trends in our history and our culture. So I think in the next decade  the sciences and the humanities will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about mankind. And I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that. It will be able to reveal new trends in our history  sometimes to explain them  and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen. Thank you very much. I wanted to talk to you today about creative confidence. I'm going to start way back in the third grade at Oakdale School in Barberton  Ohio. I remember one day my best friend Brian was working on a project. He was making a horse out of the clay that our teacher kept under the sink. And at one point  one of the girls who was sitting at his table  seeing what he was doing  leaned over and said to him   That's terrible. That doesn't look anything like a horse.  And Brian's shoulders sank. And he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the bin. I never saw Brian do a project like that ever again. And I wonder how often that happens. It seems like when I tell that story of Brian to my class  a lot of them want to come up after class and tell me about their similar experience  how a teacher shut them down or how a student was particularly cruel to them. And some opt out thinking of themselves as creative at that point. And I see that opting out that happens in childhood  and it moves in and becomes more ingrained  even by the time you get to adult life. So we see a lot of this. When we have a workshop or when we have clients in to work with us side by side  eventually we get to the point in the process that's fuzzy or unconventional. And eventually these bigshot executives whip out their Blackberries and they say they have to make really important phone calls  and they head for the exits. And they're just so uncomfortable. When we track them down and ask them what's going on  they say something like   I'm just not the creative type.  But we know that's not true. If they stick with the process  if they stick with it  they end up doing amazing things and they surprise themselves just how innovative they and their teams really are. So I've been looking at this fear of judgment that we have. That you don't do things  you're afraid you're going to be judged. If you don't say the right creative thing  you're going to be judged. And I had a major breakthrough when I met the psychologist Albert Bandura. I don't know if you know Albert Bandura. But if you go to Wikipedia  it says that he's the fourth most important psychologist in history    like Freud  Skinner  somebody and Bandura. Bandura's    and he still works at Stanford. And he's just a lovely guy. And so I went to see him because he has just worked on phobias for a long time  which I'm very interested in. He had developed this way  this kind of methodology  that ended up curing people in a very short amount of time. In four hours he had a huge cure rate of people who had phobias. And we talked about snakes. I don't know why we talked about snakes. We talked about snakes and fear of snakes as a phobia. And it was really enjoyable  really interesting. He told me that he'd invite the test subject in  and he'd say   You know  there's a snake in the next room and we're going to go in there.  To which  he reported  most of them replied   Hell no  I'm not going in there  certainly if there's a snake in there.  But Bandura has a step by step process that was super successful. So he'd take people to this two way mirror looking into the room where the snake was  and he'd get them comfortable with that. And then through a series of steps  he'd move them and they'd be standing in the doorway with the door open and they'd be looking in there. And he'd get them comfortable with that. And then many more steps later  baby steps  they'd be in the room  they'd have a leather glove like a welder's glove on  and they'd eventually touch the snake. And when they touched the snake everything was fine. They were cured. In fact  everything was better than fine. These people who had life long fears of snakes were saying things like   Look how beautiful that snake is.  And they were holding it in their laps. Bandura calls this process  guided mastery.  I love that term  guided mastery. And something else happened  these people who went through the process and touched the snake ended up having less anxiety about other things in their lives. They tried harder  they persevered longer  and they were more resilient in the face of failure. They just gained a new confidence. And Bandura calls that confidence self efficacy    the sense that you can change the world and that you can attain what you set out to do. Well meeting Bandura was really cathartic for me because I realized that this famous scientist had documented and scientifically validated something that we've seen happen for the last    years. That we could take people who had the fear that they weren't creative  and we could take them through a series of steps  kind of like a series of small successes  and they turn fear into familiarity  and they surprise themselves. That transformation is amazing. We see it at the d.school all the time. People from all different kinds of disciplines  they think of themselves as only analytical. And they come in and they go through the process  our process  they build confidence and now they think of themselves differently. And they're totally emotionally excited about the fact that they walk around thinking of themselves as a creative person. So I thought one of the things I'd do today is take you through and show you what this journey looks like. To me  that journey looks like Doug Dietz. Doug Dietz is a technical person. He designs medical imaging equipment  large medical imaging equipment. He's worked for GE  and he's had a fantastic career. But at one point he had a moment of crisis. He was in the hospital looking at one of his MRI machines in use when he saw a young family. There was a little girl  and that little girl was crying and was terrified. And Doug was really disappointed to learn that nearly    percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital had to be sedated in order to deal with his MRI machine. And this was really disappointing to Doug  because before this time he was proud of what he did. He was saving lives with this machine. But it really hurt him to see the fear that this machine caused in kids. About that time he was at the d.school at Stanford taking classes. He was learning about our process about design thinking  about empathy  about iterative prototyping. And he would take this new knowledge and do something quite extraordinary. He would redesign the entire experience of being scanned. And this is what he came up with. He turned it into an adventure for the kids. He painted the walls and he painted the machine  and he got the operators retrained by people who know kids  like children's museum people. And now when the kid comes  it's an experience. And they talk to them about the noise and the movement of the ship. And when they come  they say   Okay  you're going to go into the pirate ship  but be very still because we don't want the pirates to find you.  And the results were super dramatic. So from something like    percent of the kids needing to be sedated  to something like    percent of the kids needing to be sedated. And the hospital and GE were happy too. Because you didn't have to call the anesthesiologist all the time  they could put more kids through the machine in a day. So the quantitative results were great. But Doug's results that he cared about were much more qualitative. He was with one of the mothers waiting for her child to come out of the scan. And when the little girl came out of her scan  she ran up to her mother and said   Mommy  can we come back tomorrow   And so I've heard Doug tell the story many times  of his personal transformation and the breakthrough design that happened from it  but I've never really seen him tell the story of the little girl without a tear in his eye. Doug's story takes place in a hospital. I know a thing or two about hospitals. A few years ago I felt a lump on the side of my neck  and it was my turn in the MRI machine. It was cancer. It was the bad kind. I was told I had a    percent chance of survival. So while you're sitting around with the other patients in your pajamas and everybody's pale and thin and you're waiting for your turn to get the gamma rays  you think of a lot of things. Mostly you think about  Am I going to survive  And I thought a lot about  What was my daughter's life going to be like without me  But you think about other things. I thought a lot about  What was I put on Earth to do  What was my calling  What should I do  And I was lucky because I had lots of options. We'd been working in health and wellness  and K through     and the Developing World. And so there were lots of projects that I could work on. But I decided and I committed to at this point to the thing I most wanted to do    was to help as many people as possible regain the creative confidence they lost along their way. And if I was going to survive  that's what I wanted to do. I survived  just so you know. I really believe that when people gain this confidence    and we see it all the time at the d.school and at IDEO    they actually start working on the things that are really important in their lives. We see people quit what they're doing and go in new directions. We see them come up with more interesting  and just more  ideas so they can choose from better ideas. And they just make better decisions. So I know at TED you're supposed to have a change the world kind of thing. Everybody has a change the world thing. If there is one for me  this is it. To help this happen. So I hope you'll join me on my quest    you as thought leaders. It would be really great if you didn't let people divide the world into the creatives and the non creatives  like it's some God given thing  and to have people realize that they're naturally creative. And those natural people should let their ideas fly. That they should achieve what Bandura calls self efficacy  that you can do what you set out to do  and that you can reach a place of creative confidence and touch the snake. Thank you. This is a thousand year old drawing of the brain. It's a diagram of the visual system. And some things look very familiar today. Two eyes at the bottom  optic nerve flowing out from the back. There's a very large nose that doesn't seem to be connected to anything in particular. And if we compare this to more recent representations of the visual system  you'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated over the intervening thousand years. And that's because today we can see what's inside of the brain  rather than just looking at its overall shape. Imagine you wanted to understand how a computer works and all you could see was a keyboard  a mouse  a screen. You really would be kind of out of luck. You want to be able to open it up  crack it open  look at the wiring inside. And up until a little more than a century ago  nobody was able to do that with the brain. Nobody had had a glimpse of the brain's wiring. And that's because if you take a brain out of the skull and you cut a thin slice of it  put it under even a very powerful microscope  there's nothing there. It's gray  formless. There's no structure. It won't tell you anything. And this all changed in the late   th century. Suddenly  new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring. The computer was cracked open. So what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the Golgi stain. And it works in a very particular way. Instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue  it somehow only stains about one percent of them. It clears the forest  reveals the trees inside. If everything had been labeled  nothing would have been visible. So somehow it shows what's there. Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal  who's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience  applied this Golgi stain  which yields data which looks like this  and really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell  the neuron. And if you're thinking of the brain as a computer  this is the transistor. And very quickly Cajal realized that neurons don't operate alone  but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer. Today  a century later  when researchers want to visualize neurons  they light them up from the inside rather than darkening them. And there's several ways of doing this. But one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein. Now green fluorescent protein  which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish  is very useful. Because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell  that cell will glow green    or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein  you get a cell to glow many different colors. And so coming back to the brain  this is from a genetically engineered mouse called  Brainbow.  And it's so called  of course  because all of these neurons are glowing different colors. Now sometimes neuroscientists need to identify individual molecular components of neurons  molecules  rather than the entire cell. And there's several ways of doing this  but one of the most popular ones involves using antibodies. And you're familiar  of course  with antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system. But it turns out that they're so useful to the immune system because they can recognize specific molecules  like  for example  the coat protein of a virus that's invading the body. And researchers have used this fact in order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain  recognize specific substructures of the cell and identify them individually. And a lot of the images I've been showing you here are very beautiful  but they're also very powerful. They have great explanatory power. This  for example  is an antibody staining against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain. And you've heard of serotonin  of course  in the context of diseases like depression and anxiety. You've heard of SSRIs  which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases. And in order to understand how serotonin works  it's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is. And antibody stainings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question. I'd like to leave you with the following thought  Green fluorescent protein and antibodies are both totally natural products at the get go. They were evolved by nature in order to get a jellyfish to glow green for whatever reason  or in order to detect the coat protein of an invading virus  for example. And only much later did scientists come onto the scene and say   Hey  these are tools  these are functions that we could use in our own research tool palette.  And instead of applying feeble human minds to designing these tools from scratch  there were these ready made solutions right out there in nature developed and refined steadily for millions of years by the greatest engineer of all. Thank you. Twelve years ago  I was in the street writing my name to say   I exist.  Then I went to taking photos of people to paste them on the street to say   They exist.  From the suburbs of Paris to the wall of Israel and Palestine  the rooftops of Kenya to the favelas of Rio  paper and glue    as easy as that. I asked a question last year  Can art change the world  Well let me tell you  in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year  because the Arab Spring is still spreading  the Eurozone has collapsed ... what else  The Occupy movement found a voice  and I still have to speak English constantly. So there has been a lot of change. So when I had my TED wish last year  I said  look  I'm going to switch my concept. You are going to take the photos. You're going to send them to me. I'm going to print them and send them back to you. Then you're going to paste them where it makes sense for you to place your own statement. This is Inside Out. One hundred thousand posters have been printed this year. Those are the kind of posters  let me show you. And we keep sending more every day. This is the size. Just a regular piece of paper with a little bit of ink on it. This one was from Haiti. When I launched my wish last year  hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us. But I say it has to be under the conditions I've always worked  no credit  no logos  no sponsoring. A week later  a handful of people were there ready to rock and empower the people on the ground who wanted to change the world. These are the people I want to talk about to you today. Two weeks after my speech  in Tunisia  hundreds of portraits were made. And they pasted  over  every single portrait of the dictator  with  their own photos. Boom  This is what happened. Slim and his friends went through the country and pasted hundreds of photos everywhere to show the diversity in the country. They really make Inside Out their own project. Actually  that photo was pasted in a police station  and what you see on the ground are ID cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police. Russia. Chad wanted to fight against homophobia in Russia. He went with his friends in front of every Russian embassy in Europe and stood there with the photos to say   We have rights.  They used Inside Out as a platform for protest. Karachi  Pakistan. Sharmeen is actually here. She organized a TEDx action out there and made all the unseen faces of the city on the walls in her town. And I want to thank her today. North Dakota. Standing Rock Nation  in this Turtle Island   unclear name  from the Dakota Lakota tribe wanted to show that the Native Americans are still here. The seventh generation are still fighting for their rights. He pasted up portraits all over his reservation. And he's here also today. Each time I get a wall in New York  I use his photos to continue spreading the project. Juarez  You've heard of the border    one of the most dangerous borders in the world. Monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers and covered the entire border. Do you know what it takes to do this  People  energy  make the glue  organize the team. It was amazing. While in Iran at the same time Abololo    of course a nickname    has pasted one single face of a woman to show his resistance against the government. I don't have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action. There are tons of school projects. Twenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools. Education is so essential. Kids just make photos in a class  the teacher receives them  they paste them on the school. Here they even got the help of the firemen. There should be even more schools doing this kind of project. Of course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine. So we went there with a truck. This is a photobooth truck. You go on the back of that truck  it takes your photo     seconds later take it from the side  you're ready to rock. Thousands of people use them and each of them signs up for a two state peace solution and then walk in the street. This is march  the         march    beginning of September. They were all holding their photo as a statement. On the other side  people were wrapping up streets  buildings. It's everywhere. Come on  don't tell me that people aren't ready for peace out there. These projects took thousands of actions in one year  making hundreds of thousands of people participating  creating millions of views. This is the biggest global art participatory project that's going on. So back to the question   Can art change the world   Maybe not in one year. That's the beginning. But maybe we should change the question. Can art change people's lives  From what I've seen this year  yes. And you know what  It's just the beginning. Let's turn the world inside out together. Thank you. So  I'm going to start off with kind of the buzzkill a little bit. Forty two million people were displaced by natural disasters in     . Now  there was nothing particularly special about       because  on average     and a half million people are displaced by natural disasters every single year. Now  usually when people hear statistics or stats like that  you start thinking about places like Haiti or other kind of exotic or maybe even impoverished areas  but it happens right here in the United States every single year. Last year alone     federally declared disasters were on file with FEMA  from Joplin  Missouri  and Tuscaloosa  Alabama  to the Central Texas wildfires that just happened recently. Now  how does the most powerful country in the world handle these displaced people  They cram them onto cots  put all your personal belongings in a plastic garbage bag  stick it underneath  and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena  or a gymnasium. So obviously there's a massive housing gap  and this really upset me  because academia tells you after a major disaster  there's typically about an    month time frame to    we kinda recover  start the recovery process  but what most people don't realize is that on average it takes    to    days or more for the infamous FEMA trailers to even begin to show up. Before that time  people are left to their own devices. So I became obsessed with trying to figure out a way to actually fill this gap. This actually became my creative obsession. I put aside all my freelance work after hours and started just focusing particularly on this problem. So I started sketching. Two days after Katrina  I started sketching and sketching and trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this  and as things started to congeal or ideas started to form  I started sketching digitally on the computer  but it was an obsession  so I couldn't just stop there. I started experimenting  making models  talking to experts in the field  taking their feedback  and refining  and I kept on refining and refining for nights and weekends for over five years. Now  my obsession ended up driving me to create full size prototypes in my own backyard    Laughter    and actually spending my own personal savings on everything from tooling to patents and a variety of other costs  but in the end I ended up with this modular housing system that can react to any situation or disaster. It can be put up in any environment  from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields  because it doesn't require any special setup or specialty tools. Now  at the foundation and kind of the core of this whole system is the Exo Housing Unit  which is just the individual shelter module. And though it's light  light enough that you can actually lift it by hand and move it around  and it actually sleeps four people. And you can arrange these things as kind of more for encampments and more of a city grid type layout  or you can circle the wagons  essentially  and form these circular pods out of them  which give you this semi private communal area for people to actually spill out into so they're not actually trapped inside these units. Now this fundamentally changes the way we respond to disasters  because gone are the horrid conditions inside a sports arena or a gymnasium  where people are crammed on these cots inside. Now we have instant neighborhoods outside. So the Exo is designed to be simply  basically like a coffee cup. They can actually stack together so we get extremely efficient transportation and storage out of them. In fact     Exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself. This means the Exo can actually be transported and set up faster than any other housing option available today. But I'm obsessive  so I couldn't just stop there  so I actually started modifying the bunks where you could actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving  so the same unit can now be used for an office or storage location. The doors can actually swap out  so you can actually put on a rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control  or a connector module that would allow you to actually connect multiple units together  which gives you larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces  so now this same kit of parts  this same unit can actually serve as a living room  bedroom or bathroom  or an office  a living space and secure storage. Sounds like a great idea  but how do you make it real  So the first idea I had  initially  was just to go the federal and state governments and go   Here  take it  for free.  But I was quickly told that   Boy  our government doesn't really work like that.   Laughter  Okay. Okay. So maybe I would start a nonprofit to kind of help consult and get this idea going along with the government  but then I was told   Son  our government looks to private sector for things like this.  Okay. So maybe I would take this whole idea and go to private corporations that would have this mutually shared benefit to it  but I was quickly told by some corporations that my personal passion project was not a brand fit because they didn't want their logos stamped across the ghettos of Haiti. Now  I wasn't just obsessed. I was outraged.  Laughter.  So I decided  kind of told myself   Oh yeah  Watch this. I'll do it myself.   Laughter  Now  this quickly  my day job sent me to work out of our Milan office for a few months  so I was like  what will I do  So I actually scheduled sleep on my calendar  and spent the   hour time difference on conference calls with material suppliers  manufacturers and potential customers. And we found through this whole process  we found this great little manufacturer in Virginia  and if his body language is any indication  that's the owner    Laughter    of what it's like for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer  you've got to see what happens here.  Laughter  But G.S. Industries was fantastic. They actually built three prototypes for us by hand. So now we have prototypes that can show that four people can actually sleep securely and much more comfortably than a tent could ever provide. And they actually shipped them here to Texas for us. Now  a funny thing started happening. Other people started to believe in what we were doing  and actually offered us hangar space  donated hangar space to us. And then the Georgetown Airport Authority was bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed. So now we had a hangar space to work in  and prototypes to demo with. So in one year  we've negotiated manufacturing agreements  been awarded one patent  filed our second patent  talked to multiple people  demoed this to FEMA and its consultants to rave reviews  and then started talking to some other people who requested information  this little group called the United Nations. And on top of that  now we have a whole plethora of other individuals that have come up and started to talk to us from doing it for mining camps  mobile youth hostels  right down to the World Cup and the Olympics. So  in closing  on this whole thing here is hopefully very soon we will not have to respond to these painful phone calls that we get after disasters where we don't really have anything to sell or give you yet. Hopefully very soon we will be there  because we are destined  obsessed with making it real. Thank you.  Applause  Recently I visited Beloit  Wisconsin. And I was there to honor a great   th century explorer  Roy Chapman Andrews. During his time at the American Museum of Natural History  Andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions  like here in the Gobi Desert. He was quite a figure. He was later  it's said  the basis of the Indiana Jones character. And when I was in Beloit  Wisconsin  I gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students. And I'm here to tell you  if there's anything more intimidating than talking here at TED  it'll be trying to hold the attention of a group of a thousand    year olds for a    minute lecture. Don't try that one. At the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions  but there was one that's really stuck with me since then. There was a young girl who stood up  and she asked the question   Where should we explore   I think there's a sense that many of us have that the great age of exploration on Earth is over  that for the next generation they're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore. But is that really the case  Is there really nowhere significant for us to explore left here on Earth  It sort of made me think back to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology. This is an explorer of the unseen world  Martinus Beijerinck. So Beijerinck set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease. What he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters. And he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known    bacteria  at the time. He came up with a name for his mystery agent. He called it the virus    Latin for  poison.  And in uncovering viruses  Beijerinck really opened this entirely new world for us. We now know that viruses make up the majority of the genetic information on our planet  more than the genetic information of all other forms of life combined. And obviously there's been tremendous practical applications associated with this world    things like the eradication of smallpox  the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer  which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus. And Beijerinck's discovery  this was not something that occurred     years ago. It was a little over     years ago that Beijerinck discovered viruses. So basically we had automobiles  but we were unaware of the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet. We now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world    things like deep sequencing  which allow us to do much more than just skim the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species  but to look at entire metagenomes  the communities of teeming microorganisms in  on and around us and to document all of the genetic information in these species. We can apply these techniques to things from soil to skin and everything in between. In my organization we now do this on a regular basis to identify the causes of outbreaks that are unclear exactly what causes them. And just to give you a sense of how this works  imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you. And this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza. The first thing we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information. And if we started looking into that genetic information  we'd see a number of usual suspects out there    of course  a lot of human genetic information  but also bacterial and viral information  mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose. But we'd also see something very  very surprising. As we started to look at this information  we would see that about    percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before    no plant  animal  fungus  virus or bacteria. Basically we have no clue what this is. And for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data  a few of us have actually begun to call this information biological dark matter. We know it's not anything that we've seen before  it's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent right within our own genetic information. And there's a lot of it. If you think    percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot of biological dark matter  if we looked at your gut  up to    or    percent of that information is biological dark matter. And even in the relatively sterile blood  around one to two percent of this information is dark matter    can't be classified  can't be typed or matched with anything we've seen before. At first we thought that perhaps this was artifact. These deep sequencing tools are relatively new. But as they become more and more accurate  we've determined that this information is a form of life  or at least some of it is a form of life. And while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy  there's a very  very exciting possibility that exists  that buried in this life  in this genetic information  are signatures of as of yet unidentified life. That as we explore these strings of A's  T's  C's and G's  we may uncover a completely new class of life that  like Beijerinck  will fundamentally change the way that we think about the nature of biology. That perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us or identify the source of an outbreak that we aren't familiar with or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology. I'm pleased to announce that  along with colleagues at Stanford and Caltech and UCSF  we're currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life. A little over a hundred years ago  people were unaware of viruses  the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet. A hundred years from now  people may marvel that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life that literally was right under our noses. It's true  we may have charted all the continents on the planet and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there  but that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on Earth. Beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers    people like that young girl from Beloit  Wisconsin. And I think if we phrase that lesson  it's something like this  Don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story. Go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore. There are unknowns all around us and they're just waiting to be discovered. Thank you. I'm going to talk about religion. But it's a broad and very delicate subject  so I have to limit myself. And therefore I will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality. This is a very serious talk. So I will talk of what I remember as the most wonderful. It's when the young couple whisper   Tonight we are going to make a baby.  My talk will be about the impact of religions on the number of babies per woman. This is indeed important  because everyone understands that there is some sort of limit on how many people we can be on this planet. And there are some people who say that the world population is growing like this    three billion in       seven billion just last year    and it will continue to grow because there are religions that stop women from having few babies  and it may continue like this. To what extent are these people right  When I was born there was less than one billion children in the world  and today        there's almost two billion. What has happened since  and what do the experts predict will happen with the number of children during this century  This is a quiz. What do you think  Do you think it will decrease to one billion  Will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century  Will the number of children increase each year up to    years  or will it continue in the same fast rate and be four billion children up there  I will tell you by the end of my speech. But now  what does religion have to do with it  When you want to classify religion  it's more difficult than you think. You go to Wikipedia and the first map you find is this. It divides the world into Abrahamic religions and Eastern religion  but that's not detailed enough. So we went on and we looked in Wikipedia  we found this map. But that subdivides Christianity  Islam and Buddhism into many subgroups  which was too detailed. Therefore at Gapminder we made our own map  and it looks like this. Each country's a bubble. The size is the population    big China  big India here. And the color now is the majority religion. It's the religion where more than    percent of the people say that they belong. It's Eastern religion in India and China and neighboring Asian countries. Islam is the majority religion all the way from the Atlantic Ocean across the Middle East  Southern Europe and through Asia all the way to Indonesia. That's where we find Islamic majority. And Christian majority religions  we see in these countries. They are blue. And that is most countries in America and Europe  many countries in Africa and a few in Asia. The white here are countries which cannot be classified  because one religion does not reach    percent or there is doubt about the data or there's some other reason. So we were careful with that. So bear with our simplicity now when I take you over to this shot. This is in     . And now I show the number of babies per woman here  two  four or six    many babies  few babies. And here the income per person in comparable dollars. The reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first before you get few babies. So low income here  high income there. And indeed in       you had to be a rich Christian to have few babies. The exception was Japan. Japan here was regarded as an exception. Otherwise it was only Christian countries. But there was also many Christian countries that had six to seven babies per woman. But they were in Latin America or they were in Africa. And countries with Islam as the majority religion  all of them almost had six to seven children per woman  irregardless of the income level. And all the Eastern religions except Japan had the same level. Now let's see what has happened in the world. I start the world  and here we go. Now         can you see they're getting a little richer  but the number of babies per woman is falling  Look at China. They're falling fairly fast. And all of the Muslim majority countries across the income are coming down  as do the Christian majority countries in the middle income range. And when we enter into this century  you'll find more than half of mankind down here. And by       we are actually    percent of humans who live in countries with about two children per woman. It's a quite amazing development which has happened. And these are countries from United States here  with         per capita  France  Russia  Iran  Mexico  Turkey  Algeria  Indonesia  India and all the way to Bangladesh and Vietnam  which has less than five percent of the income per person of the United States and the same amount of babies per woman. I can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries. We get that from the census data. It's not one of these statistics which is very doubtful. So what we can conclude is you don't have to get rich to have few children. It has happened across the world. And then when we look at religions  we can see that the Eastern religions  indeed there's not one single country with a majority of that religion that has more than three children. Whereas with Islam as a majority religion and Christianity  you see countries all the way. But there's no major difference. There's no major difference between these religions. There is a difference with income. The countries which have many babies per woman here  they have quite low income. Most of them are in sub Saharan Africa. But there are also countries here like Guatemala  like Papua New Guinea  like Yemen and Afghanistan. Many think that Afghanistan here and Congo  which have suffered severe conflicts  that they don't have fast population growth. It's the other way around. In the world today  it's the countries that have the highest mortality rates that have the fastest population growth. Because the death of a child is compensated by one more child. These countries have six children per woman. They have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman. But    years from now  Afghanistan will go from    million to    million. Congo will go from    to    . That's where we have the fast population growth. And many think that these countries are stagnant  but they are not. Let me compare Senegal  a Muslim dominated country  with a Christian dominated country  Ghana. I take them backwards here to their independence  when they were up here in the beginning of the     s. Just look what they have done. It's an amazing improvement  from seven children per woman  they've gone all the way down to between four and five. It's a tremendous improvement. So what does it take  Well we know quite well what is needed in these countries. You need to have children to survive. You need to get out of the deepest poverty so children are not of importance for work in the family. You need to have access to some family planning. And you need the fourth factor  which perhaps is the most important factor. But let me illustrate that fourth factor by looking at Qatar. Here we have Qatar today  and there we have Bangladesh today. If I take these countries back to the years of their independence  which is almost the same year    '    '      it's a quite amazing development which had happened. Look at Bangladesh and Qatar. With so different incomes  it's almost the same drop in number of babies per woman. And what is the reason in Qatar  Well I do as I always do. I went to the statistical authority of Qatar  to their webpage    It's a very good webpage. I recommend it    and I looked up    oh yeah  you can have lots of fun here    and provided free of charge  I found Qatar's social trends. Very interesting. Lots to read. I found fertility at birth  and I looked at total fertility rate per woman. These are the scholars and experts in the government agency in Qatar  and they say the most important factors are   Increased age at first marriage  increased educational level of Qatari woman and more women integrated in the labor force.  I couldn't agree more. Science couldn't agree more. This is a country that indeed has gone through a very  very interesting modernization. So what it is  is these four  Children should survive  children shouldn't be needed for work  women should get education and join the labor force and family planning should be accessible. Now look again at this. The average number of children in the world is like in Colombia    it's  .  today. There are countries up here which are very poor. And that's where family planning  better child survival is needed. I strongly recommend Melinda Gates' last TEDTalk. And here  down  there are many countries which are less than two children per woman. So when I go back now to give you the answer of the quiz  it's two. We have reached peak child. The number of children is not growing any longer in the world. We are still debating peak oil  but we have definitely reached peak child. And the world population will stop growing. The United Nations Population Division has said it will stop growing at    billion. But why do they grow if the number of children doesn't grow  Well I will show you here. I will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came. They are quite useful for educational purposes. Each card box is one billion people. And there are two billion children in the world. There are two billion young people between    and   . These are rounded numbers. Then there is one billion between    and     almost one between    and   . And then it's my box. This is me     plus. We are here on top. So what will happen now is what we call  the big fill up.  You can see that it's like three billion missing here. They are not missing because they've died  they were never born. Because before       there were much fewer people born than there were during the last    years. So what will happen now is quite straightforward. The old  sadly  we will die. The rest of you  you will grow older and you will get two billion children. Then the old will die. The rest will grow older and get two billion children. And then again the old will die and you will get two billion children. This is the great fill up. It's inevitable. And can you see that this increase took place without life getting longer and without adding children  Religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman. All the religions in the world are fully capable to maintain their values and adapt to this new world. And we will be just    billion in this world  if the poorest people get out of poverty  their children survive  they get access to family planning. That is needed. But it's inevitable that we will be two to three billion more. So when you discuss and when you plan for the resources and the energy needed for the future  for human beings on this planet  you have to plan for    billion. Thank you very much. This sound  this smell  this sight all remind me of the campfires of my childhood  when anyone could become a storyteller in front of the dancing flames. There was this wondrous ending when people and fire fell asleep almost in unison. It was dreaming time. Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming  although I'm known to make my dreams come true. Last year  I created a one man show. For an hour and a half I shared with the audience a lifetime of creativity  how I pursue perfection  how I cheat the impossible. And then TED challenged me   Philippe  can you shrink this lifetime to    minutes   Eighteen minutes  clearly impossible. But here I am. One solution was to rehearse a machine gun delivery in which every syllable  every second will have its importance and hope to God the audience will be able to follow me. No  no  no. No  the best way for me to start is to pay my respects to the gods of creativity. So please join me for a minute of silence. Okay  I cheated  it was a mere    seconds. But hey  we're on TED time. When I was six years old  I fell in love with magic. For Christmas I got a magic box and a very old book on card manipulation. Somehow I was more interested in pure manipulation than in all the silly little tricks in the box. So I looked in the book for the most difficult move  and it was this. Now I'm not supposed to share that with you  but I have to show you the card is hidden in the back of the hand. Now that manipulation was broken down into seven moves described over seven pages. One  two  three  four  five  six and seven. And let me show you something else. The cards were bigger than my hands. Two months later  six years old  I'm able to do one  two  three  four  five  six  seven. And I go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him   Well what do you think   Six years old. The magician looked at me and said   This is a disaster. You cannot do that in two seconds and have a minuscule part of the card showing. For the move to be professional  it has to be less than one second and it has to be perfect.  Two years later  one    zoop. And I'm not cheating. It's in the back. It's perfect. Passion is the motto of all my actions. As I'm studying magic  juggling is mentioned repeatedly as a great way to acquire dexterity and coordination. Now I had long admired how fast and fluidly jugglers make objects fly. So that's it. I'm     I'm becoming a juggler. I befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe  and he agrees to sell me three clubs. But in America you have to explain. What are clubs  Nothing to do with golf. They are those beautiful oblong objects  but quite difficult to make. They have to be precisely lathed. Oh  when I was buying the clubs  somehow the young juggler was hiding from the others. Well I didn't think much of it at the time. Anyway  here I was progressing with my new clubs. But I could not understand. I was pretty fast  but I was not fluid at all. The clubs were escaping me at each throw. And I was trying constantly to bring them back to me. Until one day I practiced in front of Francis Brunn  the world's greatest juggler. And he was frowning. And he finally asked   Can I see those   So I proudly showed him my clubs. He said   Philippe  you have been had. These are rejects. They are completely out of alignment. They are impossible to juggle.  Tenacity is how I kept at it against all odds. So I went to the circus to see more magicians  more jugglers  and I saw    oh no  no  no  I didn't see. It was more interesting  I heard. I heard about those amazing men and women who walk on thin air    the high wire walkers. Now I have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood  so that's it. I'm     I'm becoming a wire walker. I found two trees    but not any kind of trees  trees with character    and then a very long rope. And I put the rope around and around and around and around and around till I had no more rope. Now I have all of those ropes parallel like this. I get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers  and I gather them together in some kind of ropey path. So I just created the widest tightrope in the world. What did I need  I needed the widest shoes in the world. So I found some enormous  ridiculous  giant ski boots and then wobbly  wobbly I get on the ropes. Well within a few days I'm able to do one crossing. So I cut one rope off. And the next day one rope off. And a few days later  I was practicing on a single tightrope. Now you can imagine at that time I had to switch the ridiculous boots for some slippers. So that is how    in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try    this is how not to learn wire walking. Intuition is a tool essential in my life. In the meantime  I am being thrown out of five different schools because instead of listening to the teachers  I am my own teacher  progressing in my new art and becoming a street juggler. On the high wire  within months  I'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus  except I am not satisfied. I was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection. But nobody wanted to hire me. So I started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission. Notre Dame  the Sydney Harbor Bridge  the World Trade Center. And I developed a certitude  a faith that convinced me that I will get safely to the other side. If not  I will never do that first step. Well nonetheless  on the top of the World Trade Center my first step was terrifying. All of a sudden the density of the air is no longer the same. Manhattan no longer spreads its infinity. The murmur of the city dissolves into a squall whose chilling power I no longer feel. I lift the balancing pole. I approach the edge. I step over the beam. I put my left foot on the cable  the weight of my body raised on my right leg anchored to the flank of the building. Shall I ever so slightly shift my weight to the left  My right leg will be unburdened  my right foot will freely meet the wire. On one side  a mass of a mountain  a life I know. On the other  the universe of the clouds  so full of unknown we think it's empty. At my feet  the path to the north tower       yards of wire rope. It's a straight line  which sags  which sways  which vibrates  which rolls on itself  which is ice  which is three tons tight  ready to explode  ready to swallow me. An inner howl assails me  the wild longing to flee. But it is too late. The wire is ready. Decisively my other foot sets itself onto the cable. Faith is what replaces doubt in my dictionary. So after the walk people ask me   How can you top that   Well I didn't have that problem. I was not interested in collecting the gigantic  in breaking records. In fact  I put my World Trade Center crossing at the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks    or some completely different type of performance. Let's see  such as my street juggling  for example. So each time I draw my circle of chalk on the pavement and enter as the improvising comic silent character I created    years ago  I am as happy as when I am in the clouds. But this here  this is not the street. So I cannot street juggle here  you understand. So you don't want me to street juggle here  right  You know that  right  You don't want me to juggle  right  Thank you. Thank you. Each time I street juggle I use improvisation. Now improvisation is empowering because it welcomes the unknown. And since what's impossible is always unknown  it allows me to believe I can cheat the impossible. Now I have done the impossible not once  but many times. So what should I share  Oh  I know. Israel. Some years ago I was invited to open the Israel Festival by a high wire walk. And I chose to put my wire between the Arab quarters and the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem over the Ben Hinnom Valley. And I thought it would be incredible if in the middle of the wire I stopped and  like a magician  I produce a dove and send her in the sky as a living symbol of peace. Well now I must say  it was a little bit hard to find a dove in Israel  but I got one. And in my hotel room  each time I practiced making it appear and throwing her in the air  she would graze the wall and end up on the bed. So I said  now it's okay. The room is too small. I mean  a bird needs space to fly. It will go perfectly on the day of the walk. Now comes the day of the walk. Eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley. The mayor of Jerusalem  Teddy Kollek  comes to wish me the best. But he seemed nervous. There was tension in my wire  but I also could feel tension on the ground. Because all those people were made up of people who  for the most part  considered each other enemies. So I start the walk. Everything is fine. I stop in the middle. I make the dove appear. People applaud in delight. And then in the most magnificent gesture  I send the bird of peace into the azure. But the bird  instead of flying away  goes flop  flop  flop and lands on my head. And people scream. So I grab the dove  and for the second time I send her in the air. But the dove  who obviously didn't go to flying school  goes flop  flop  flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole. You laugh  you laugh. But hey. I sit down immediately. It's a reflex of wire walkers. Now in the meantime  the audience  they go crazy. They must think this guy with this dove  he must have spent years working with him. What a genius  what a professional. So I take a bow. I salute with my hand. And at the end I bang my hand against the pole to dislodge the bird. Now the dove  who  now you know  obviously cannot fly  does for the third time a little flop  flop  flop and ends up on the wire behind me. And the entire valley goes crazy. Now but hold on  I'm not finished. So now I'm like    yards from my arrival and I'm exhausted  so my steps are slow. And something happened. Somebody somewhere  a group of people  starts clapping in rhythm with my steps. And within seconds the entire valley is applauding in unison with each of my steps. But not an applause of delight like before  an applause encouragement. For a moment  the entire crowd had forgotten their differences. They had become one  pushing me to triumph. I want you just for a second to experience this amazing human symphony. So let's say I am here and the chair is my arrival. So I walk  you clap  everybody in unison. So after the walk  Teddy and I become friends. And he tells me  he has on his desk a picture of me in the middle of the wire with a dove on my head. He didn't know the true story. And whenever he's daunted by an impossible situation to solve in this hard to manage city  instead of giving up  he looks at the picture and he says   If Philippe can do that  I can do this   and he goes back to work. Inspiration. By inspiring ourselves we inspire others. I will never forget this music  and I hope now neither will you. Please take this music with you home  and start gluing feathers to your arms and take off and fly  and look at the world from a different perspective. And when you see mountains  remember mountains can be moved. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Let's begin with a story. Once upon a time    well actually less than two years ago    in a kingdom not so very far away  there was a man who traveled many miles to come to work at the jewel in the kingdom's crown    an internationally famous company. Let's call it Island Networks. Now this kingdom had many resources and mighty ambitions  but the one thing it lacked was people. And so it invited workers from around the world to come and help it build the nation. But in order to enter and to stay these migrants had to pass a few tests. And so it was  our man presented himself to authorities in the kingdom  looking forward to settling into his new life. But then something unexpected happened. The medical personnel who took blood samples from the man never actually told him what they were testing for. He wasn't offered counseling before or after the test  which is best medical practice. He was never informed of the results of the test. And yet  a couple of weeks later  he was picked up and taken to prison where he was subjected to a medical exam  including a full body search in full view of the others in the cell. He was released  but then a day or two later  he was taken to the airport and he was deported. What on earth did this man do to merit this treatment  What was his terrible crime  He was infected with HIV. Now the kingdom is one of about    countries that imposes restrictions on the entry or stay of people living with HIV. The kingdom argues that its laws allow it to detain or deport foreigners who pose a risk to the economy or the security or the public health or the morals of the state. But these laws  when applied to people living with HIV  are a violation of international human rights agreements to which these countries are signatories. But you know what  Matters of principle aside  practically speaking  these laws drive HIV underground. People are less likely to come forth to be tested or treated or to disclose their condition  none of which helps these individuals or the communities these laws purport to protect. Today we can prevent the transmission of HIV. And with treatment  it is a manageable condition. We are very far from the days when the only practical response to dread disease was to have banished the afflicted    like this   The Exile of the Leper.  So you tell me why  in our age of science  we still have laws and policies which come from an age of superstition. Time for a quick show of hands. Who here has been touched by HIV    either because you yourself have the virus or you have a family member or a friend or a colleague who is living with HIV  Hands up. Wow. Wow. That's a significant number of us. You know better than anyone that HIV brings out the best and the worst in humanity. And the laws reflect these attitudes. I'm not just talking about laws on the books  but laws as they are enforced on the streets and laws as they are decided in the courts. And I'm not just talking about laws as they relate to people living with HIV  but people who are at greatest risk of infection    people such as those who inject drugs or sex workers or men who have sex with men or transgendered persons or migrants or prisoners. And in many parts of the world that includes women and children who are especially vulnerable. Now there are laws in many parts of the world which reflect the best of human nature. These laws treat people touched by HIV with compassion and acceptance. These laws respect universal human rights and they are grounded in evidence. These laws ensure that people living with HIV and those at greatest risk are protected from violence and discrimination and that they get access to prevention and to treatment. Unfortunately  these good laws are counter balanced by a mass of really bad law    law which is grounded in moral judgement and in fear and in misinformation  laws which specifically punish people living with HIV or those at greatest risk. These laws fly in the face of science  and they are grounded in prejudice and in ignorance and in a rewriting of tradition and a selective reading of religion. But you know what  You don't have to take my word for it. We're going to hear from two people who are on the sharp end of the law. The first is Nick Rhoades. He's an American. And he was convicted under the U.S. State of Iowa's law on HIV transmission and exposure    neither of which offense he actually committed. then that is telling society that is unacceptable  that's bad behavior. And I think the severity of that punishment tells you how bad you are as a person. You're a class B felon  lifetime sex offender. You are a very  very  very bad person. And you did a very  very  very bad thing. And so that's just programmed into you. And you go through the correctional system and everyone's telling you the same thing. And you're just like  I'm a very bad person. Shereen El Feki  It's not just a question of unfair or ineffective laws. Some countries have good laws  laws which could stem the tide of HIV. The problem is that these laws are flouted. Because stigma gives unofficial license to treat people living with HIV or those at greatest risk unlike other citizens. And this is exactly what happened to Helma and Dongo from Namibia. when I went to the hospital for a pregnancy check up. The nurse announced that every pregnant woman must also be tested for HIV that day. I took the test and the result showed I was positive. That's the day I found out. The nurse said to me   Why should you people bcome pregnant when you know you are HIV positive  Why are you pregnant when you are living positive   I am sure now that is the reason they sterilized me. Because I am HIV positive. They didn't give the forms to me or explain what was in the form. The nurse just came with it already marked where I had to sign. And with the labor pain  I didn't have the strength to ask them to read it to me. I just signed. SE  Hilma and Nick and our man in the kingdom are among the    million people living with HIV according to recent estimates. They're the lucky ones because they're still alive. According to those same estimates  in       .  million people died of AIDS related causes. These are terrible and tragic figures. But if we look a little more broadly into the statistics  we actually see some reason for hope. Looking globally  the number of new infections of HIV is declining. And looking globally as well  deaths are also starting to fall. There are many reasons for these positive developments  but one of the most remarkable is in the increase in the number of people around the world on anti retroviral therapy  the medicines they need to keep their HIV in check. Now there are still many problems. Only about half of the people who need treatment are currently receiving it. In some parts of the world    like here in the Middle East and North Africa    new infections are rising and so are deaths. And the money  the money we need for the global response to HIV  that is shrinking. But for the first time in three decades into this epidemic we have a real chance to come to grips with HIV. But in order to do that we need to tackle an epidemic of really bad law. It's for this reason that the Global Commission on HIV and the Law  of which I'm a member  was established by the agencies of the United Nations    to look at the ways that legal environments are affecting people living with HIV and those at greatest risk  and to recommend what should be done to make the law an ally  not an enemy  of the global response to HIV. Let me give you just one example of the way a legal environment can make a positive difference. People who inject drugs are one of those groups I mentioned. They're at high risk of HIV through contaminated injection equipment and other risk related behaviors. In fact  one in every    new infections of HIV is among people who inject drugs. Now drug use or possession is illegal in almost every country. But some countries take a harder line on this than others. In Thailand people who use drugs  or are merely suspected of using drugs  are placed in detention centers  like the one you see here  where they are supposed to clean up. There is absolutely no evidence to show that throwing people into detention cures their drug dependence. There is  however  ample evidence to show that incarcerating people increases their risk of HIV and other infections. We know how to reduce HIV transmission and other risks in people who inject drugs. It's called harm reduction  and it involves  among other things  providing clean needles and syringes  offering opioid substitution therapy and other evidence based treatments to reduce drug dependence. It involves providing information and education and condoms to reduce HIV transmission  and also providing HIV testing and counseling and treatment should people become infected. Where the legal environment allows for harm reduction the results are striking. Australia and Switzerland were two countries which introduced harm reduction very early on in their HIV epidemics  and they have a very low rate of HIV among injecting drug users. The U.S. and Malaysia came to harm reduction a little later  and they have higher rates of HIV in these populations. Thailand and Russia  however  have resisted harm reduction and have stringent laws which punish drug use. And hey  surprise  very high rates of HIV among people who are injecting drugs. At the Global Commission we have studied the evidence  and we've heard the experiences of over     people from     countries. And the trend  Well the trend is clear. Where you criminalize people living with HIV or those at greatest risk  you fuel the epidemic. Now coming up with a vaccine for HIV or a cure for AIDS    now that's rocket science. But changing the law isn't. And in fact  a number of countries are starting to make progress on a number of points. To begin  countries need to review their legislation as it touches HIV and vulnerable groups. On the back of those reviews  governments should repeal laws that punish or discriminate against people living with HIV or those at greatest risk. Repealing a law isn't easy  and it's particularly difficult when it relates to touchy subjects like drugs and sex. But there's plenty you can do while that process is underway. One of the key points is to reform the police so that they have better practices on the ground. So for example  outreach workers who are distributing condoms to vulnerable populations are not themselves subject to police harassment or abuse or arbitrary arrest. We can also train judges so that they find flexibilities in the law and so that they rule on the side of tolerance rather than prejudice. We can retool prisons so that HIV prevention and harm reduction is available to prisoners. The key to all this is reinforcing civil society. Because civil society is key to raising awareness among vulnerable groups of their legal rights. But awareness needs action. And so we need to ensure that these people who are living with HIV or at greatest risk of HIV have access to legal services and they have equal access to the courts. And also important is talking to communities so that we change interpretations of religious or customary law  which is too often used to justify punishment and fuel stigma. For many of us here HIV is not an abstract threat. It hits very close to home. The law  on the other hand  can seem remote  arcane  the stuff of specialists  but it isn't. Because for those of us who live in democracies  or in aspiring democracies  the law begins with us. Laws that treat people living with HIV or those at greatest risk with respect start with the way that we treat them ourselves  as equals. If we are going to stop the spread of HIV in our lifetime  then that is the change we need to spread. Thank you. ici faire Des choses on peut manger. c'est pas pass  the first time. about this convention. It's not so much  as so little has to do with what everything is. But it is within our self interest to understand the topography of our lives unto ourselves. The future states that there is no time other than the collapsation of that sensation of the mirror of the memories in which we are living. Common knowledge  but important nonetheless. As we face fear in these times  and fear is all around us  we also have anti fear. It's hard to imagine or measure. The background radiation is simply too static to be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis. when a lot of us    you know what I'm saying  But    you know what I'm saying  Because  as a hip hop thing  you know what I'm saying  TED be rocking    you know what I'm saying. Like so I wrote a song  and I hope you guys dig it. It's a song about people and sasquatches    And other French science stuff. That's French science. Okay  here we go. I know that I'm in trouble that I'm in trouble by myself But every time it gets me And you're the one that I want to be so saucy And you're the one I want to  unclear   baby And you can do anything as long as you don't get hurt along the way back If I survive  I'm going to tell you what is wrong Because if you were  unclear  And I think that you're looking like a  unclear  I give you what I want to be you could use as many of those things that you want. And the computer models  no matter how many that you have and how many people that you use  are never going to be able to arrive at the same conclusions. Four years ago I worked with a few people at the Brookings Institute  and I arrived at a conclusion. Tomorrow is another day. Not just any day  but it is a day. It will get here  there's no question. And the important thing to remember is that this simulation is a good one. It's believable  it's tactile. You can reach out    things are solid. You can move objects from one area to another. You can feel your body. You can say   I'd like to go over to this location   and you can move this mass of molecules through the air over to another location  at will. That's something you live inside of every day. Now with the allocation and the understanding of the lack of understanding  we enter into a new era of science in which we feel nothing more than so much so as to say that those within themselves  comporary or non comporary  will figuratively figure into the folding of our non understanding and our partial understanding to the networks of which we all draw our source and conclusions from. So  as I say before the last piece  feel not as though it is a sphere we live on  rather an infinite plane which has the illusion of leading yourself back to the point of origin. Once we understand that all the spheres in the sky are just large infinite planes  it will be plain to see. This is my final piece. And just remember  everything you are    it's more important to realize the negative space  as music is only the division of space  it is the space we are listening to divided as such  which gives us the information in comparison to something other that gives us the idea of what the idea that wants to be transmitted wants to be. So please  without further ado. Thank you. This is a fun one. It goes like this. Okay  for the last piece I'd like to do  this one goes very similar to this. I hope you guys recognize it. Here we go. Okay  that still works. Okay  good. All right  here we go. Here we go. Yeah  yo  yo  yo Thank you. Enjoy the rest. When the Industrial Revolution started  the amount of carbon sitting underneath Britain in the form of coal was as big as the amount of carbon sitting under Saudi Arabia in the form of oil  and this carbon powered the Industrial Revolution  it put the  Great  in Great Britain  and led to Britain's temporary world domination. And then  in       coal production in Britain peaked  and has declined ever since. In due course  Britain started using oil and gas from the North Sea  and in the year       oil and gas production from the North Sea also peaked  and they're now on the decline. These observations about the finiteness of easily accessible  local  secure fossil fuels  this is a motivation for saying   Well  what's next  What is life after fossil fuels going to be like  Shouldn't we be thinking hard about how to get off fossil fuels   Another motivation  of course  is climate change. And when people talk about life after fossil fuels and climate change action  I think there's a lot of fluff  a lot of greenwash  a lot of misleading advertising  and I feel a duty as a physicist to try to guide people around the claptrap and help people understand the actions that really make a difference and to focus on ideas that do add up. Let me illustrate this with what physicists call a back of envelope calculation. We love back of envelope calculations. You ask a question  you write down some numbers  and you get yourself an answer. It may not be very accurate  but it may make you say   Hmm.  So here's a question  Imagine if we said   Oh yes  we can get off fossil fuels. We'll use biofuels. Problem solved. Transport  we don't need oil anymore.  Well  what if we grew the biofuels for a road on the grass verge at the edge of the road  How wide would the verge have to be for that to work out  Okay  so let's put in some numbers. Let's have our cars go at    miles per hour. Let's say they do    miles per gallon. That's the European average for new cars. Let's say the productivity of biofuel plantations is       litres of biofuel per hectare per year. That's true of European biofuels. And let's imagine the cars are spaced    meters apart from each other  and they're just perpetually going along this road. The length of the road doesn't matter  because the longer the road  the more biofuel plantation we've got. What do we do with these numbers  Well  you take the first number  and you divide by the other three  and you get eight kilometers. And that's the answer. That's how wide the plantation would have to be  given these assumptions. And maybe that makes you say   Hmm. Maybe this isn't going to be quite so easy.  And it might make you think  perhaps there's an issue to do with areas  and in this talk  I'd like to talk about land areas  and ask  is there an issue about areas  The answer is going to be yes but it depends which country you are in. So let's start in the United Kingdom  since that's where we are today. The energy consumption of the United Kingdom  the total energy consumption  not just transport  but everything  I like to quantify it in light bulbs. It's as if we've all got     light bulbs on all the time      kilowatt hours per day per person is the energy consumption of the U.K. So there's    light bulbs' worth for transport     light bulbs' worth for heating  and    light bulbs' worth for making electricity  and other things are relatively small compared to those three big fish. It's actually a bigger footprint if we take into account the embodied energy in the stuff we import into our country as well  and    percent of this energy today still comes from fossil fuels  and    percent only from other  greener    possibly greener    sources like nuclear power and renewables. So  that's the U.K.  and the population density of the U.K. is     people per square kilometer  and I'm now going to show you other countries by these same two measures. On the vertical axis  I'm going to show you how much light bulbs    what our energy consumption per person is  and we're at     light bulbs per person  and that little blue dot there is showing you the land area of the United Kingdom  and the population density is on the horizontal axis  and we're     people per square kilometer. Let's add European countries in blue  and you can see there's quite a variety. I should emphasize  both of these axes are logarithmic. As you go from one gray bar to the next gray bar you're going up a factor of   . Next  let's add Asia in red  the Middle East and North Africa in green  sub Saharan Africa in blue  black is South America  purple is Central America  and then in pukey yellow  we have North America  Australia and New Zealand. And you can see the great diversity of population densities and of per capita consumptions. Countries are different from each other. Top left  we have Canada and Australia  with enormous land areas  very high per capita consumption      or     light bulbs per person  and very low population densities. Top right  Bahrain has the same energy consumption per person  roughly  as Canada  over     light bulbs per person  but their population density is a factor of     times greater        people per square kilometer. Bottom right  Bangladesh has the same population density as Bahrain but consumes     times less per person. Bottom left  well  there's no one. But there used to be a whole load of people. Here's another message from this diagram. I've added on little blue tails behind Sudan  Libya  China  India  Bangladesh. That's    years of progress. Where were they    years ago  and where are they now  And the message is  most countries are going to the right  and they're going up  up and to the right    bigger population density and higher per capita consumption. So  we may be off in the top right hand corner  slightly unusual  the United Kingdom accompanied by Germany  Japan  South Korea  the Netherlands  and a bunch of other slightly odd countries  but many other countries are coming up and to the right to come and join us  so we're a picture  if you like  of what the future energy consumption might be looking like in other countries too. And I've also added in this diagram now some pink lines that go down and to the right. Those are lines of equal power consumption per unit area  which I measure in watts per square meter. So  for example  the middle line there   .  watts per square meter  is the energy consumption per unit area of Saudi Arabia  Norway  Mexico in purple  and Bangladesh    years ago  and half of the world's population lives in countries that are already above that line. The United Kingdom is consuming  .   watts per square meter. So's Germany  and Japan is consuming a bit more. So  let's now say why this is relevant. Why is it relevant  Well  we can measure renewables in the same units and other forms of power production in the same units  and renewables is one of the leading ideas for how we could get off our    percent fossil fuel habit. So here come some renewables. Energy crops deliver half a watt per square meter in European climates. What does that mean  And you might have anticipated that result  given what I told you about the biofuel plantation a moment ago. Well  we consume  .   watts per square meter. What this means is  even if you covered the whole of the United Kingdom with energy crops  you couldn't match today's energy consumption. Wind power produces a bit more   .  watts per square meter  but that's only twice as big as  .   watts per square meter  so that means if you wanted literally to produce total energy consumption in all forms on average from wind farms  you need wind farms half the area of the U.K. I've got data to back up all these assertions  by the way. Next  let's look at solar power. Solar panels  when you put them on a roof  deliver about    watts per square meter in England. If you really want to get a lot from solar panels  you need to adopt the traditional Bavarian farming method where you leap off the roof and coat the countryside with solar panels too. Solar parks  because of the gaps between the panels  deliver less. They deliver about   watts per square meter of land area. And here's a solar park in Vermont with real data delivering  .  watts per square meter. Remember where we are   .   watts per square meter  wind farms  .   solar parks about five. So  whatever  whichever of those renewables you pick  the message is  whatever mix of those renewables you're using  if you want to power the U.K. on them  you're going to need to cover something like    percent or    percent of the country with those renewables. And I'm not saying that's a bad idea. We just need to understand the numbers. I'm absolutely not anti renewables. I love renewables. But I'm also pro arithmetic.  Laughter  Concentrating solar power in deserts delivers larger powers per unit area  because you don't have the problem of clouds  and so this facility delivers    watts per square meter  this one    watts per square meter  and this one in Spain   watts per square meter. Being generous to concentrating solar power  I think it's perfect credible it could deliver    watts per square meter. So that's nice. Of course  Britain doesn't have any deserts. Yet.  Laughter  So here's a summary so far. All renewables  much as I love them  are diffuse. They all have a small power per unit area  and we have to live with that fact. And that means  if you do want renewables to make a substantial difference for a country like the United Kingdom on the scale of today's consumption  you need to be imagining renewable facilities that are country sized  not the entire country but a fraction of the country  a substantial fraction. There are other options for generating power as well which don't involve fossil fuels. So there's nuclear power  and on this Ordnance Survey map  you can see there's a Sizewell B inside a blue square kilometer. That's one gigawatt in a square kilometer  which works out to       watts per square meter. So by this particular metric  nuclear power isn't as intrusive as renewables. Of course  other metrics matter too  and nuclear power has all sorts of popularity problems. But the same goes for renewables as well. Here's a photograph of a consultation exercise in full swing in the little town of Penicuik just outside Edinburgh  and you can see the children of Penicuik celebrating the burning of the effigy of the windmill. So people are anti everything  and we've got to keep all the options on the table. What can a country like the U.K. do on the supply side  Well  the options are  I'd say  these three  power renewables  and recognizing that they need to be close to country sized  other people's renewables  so we could go back and talk very politely to the people in the top left hand side of the diagram and say   Uh  we don't want renewables in our backyard  but  um  please could we put them in yours instead   And that's a serious option. It's a way for the world to handle this issue. So countries like Australia  Russia  Libya  Kazakhstan  could be our best friends for renewable production. And a third option is nuclear power. So that's some supply side options. In addition to the supply levers that we can push  and remember  we need large amounts  because at the moment  we get    percent of our energy from fossil fuels. In addition to those levers  we could talk about other ways of solving this issue  namely  we could reduce demand  and that means reducing population   I'm not sure how to do that   or reducing per capita consumption. So let's talk about three more big levers that could really help on the consumption side. First  transport. Here are the physics principles that tell you how to reduce the energy consumption of transport  and people often say   Oh  yes  technology can answer everything. We can make vehicles that are a hundred times more efficient.  And that's almost true. Let me show you. The energy consumption of this typical tank here is    kilowatt hours per hundred person kilometers. That's the average European car. Eighty kilowatt hours. Can we make something a hundred times better by applying those physics principles I just listed  Yes. Here it is. It's the bicycle. It's    times better in energy consumption  and it's powered by biofuel  by Weetabix. And there are other options in between  because maybe the lady in the tank would say   No  no  no  that's a lifestyle change. Don't change my lifestyle  please.  So  well  we could persuade her to get into a train  and that's still a lot more efficient than a car  but that might be a lifestyle change  or there's the eco car  top left. It comfortably accommodates one teenager and it's shorter than a traffic cone  and it's almost as efficient as a bicycle as long as you drive it at    miles per hour. In between  perhaps some more realistic options on this lever  transport lever  are electric vehicles  so electric bikes and electric cars in the middle  perhaps four times as energy efficient as the standard petrol powered tank. Next  there's the heating lever. Heating is a third of our energy consumption in Britain  and quite a lot of that is going into homes and other buildings doing space heating and water heating. So here's a typical crappy British house. It's my house  with the Ferrari out front. What can we do to it  Well  the laws of physics are written up there  which describe what    how the power consumption for heating is driven by the things you can control. The things you can control are the temperature difference between the inside and the outside  and there's this remarkable technology called a thermostat. You grasp it  you rotate it to the left  and your energy consumption in the home will decrease. I've tried it. It works. Some people call it a lifestyle change. You can also get the fluff men in to reduce the leakiness of your building    put fluff in the walls  fluff in the roof  and a new front door and so forth  and the sad truth is  this will save you money. That's not sad  that's good  but the sad truth is  it'll only get about    percent of the leakiness of your building  if you do these things  which are good ideas. If you really want to get a bit closer to Swedish building standards with a crappy house like this  you need to be putting external insulation on the building as shown by this block of flats in London. You can also deliver heat more efficiently using heat pumps which use a smaller bit of high grade energy like electricity to move heat from your garden into your house. The third demand side option I want to talk about  the third way to reduce energy consumption is  read your meters. And people talk a lot about smart meters  but you can do it yourself. Use your own eyes and be smart  read your meter  and if you're anything like me  it'll change your life. Here's a graph I made. I was writing a book about sustainable energy  and a friend asked me   Well how much energy do you use at home   And I was embarrassed. I didn't actually know. And so I started reading the meter every week  and the old meter readings are shown in the top half of the graph  and then      is shown in green at the bottom  and that was when I was reading the meter every week  and my life changed  because I started doing experiments and seeing what made a difference  and my gas consumption plummeted because I started tinkering with the thermostat and the timing on the heating system  and I knocked more than a half off my gas bills. There's a similar story for my electricity consumption  where switching off the DVD players  the stereos  the computer peripherals that were on all the time  and just switching them on when I needed them  knocked another third off my electricity bills too. So we need a plan that adds up  and I've described for you six big levers  and we need big action because we get    percent of our energy from fossil fuels  and so you need to push hard on most if not all of these levers. And most of these levers have popularity problems  and if there is a lever you don't like the use of  well please do bear in mind that means you need even stronger effort on the other levers. So I'm a strong advocate of having grown up conversations that are based on numbers and facts  and I want to close with this map that just visualizes for you the requirement of land and so forth in order to get just    light bulbs per person from four of the big possible sources. So  if you wanted to get    light bulbs  remember  today our total energy consumption is     light bulbs' worth. If you wanted    from wind  this map visualizes a solution for the U.K. It's got     wind farms  each     square kilometers in size  and that would be a twentyfold increase over today's amount of wind. Nuclear power  to get    light bulbs per person  you'd need two gigawatts at each of the purple dots on the map. That's a fourfold increase over today's levels of nuclear power. Biomass  to get    light bulbs per person  you'd need a land area something like three and a half Wales' worth  either in our country  or in someone else's country  possibly Ireland  possibly somewhere else.  Laughter  And a fourth supply side option  concentrating solar power in other people's deserts  if you wanted to get    light bulbs' worth  then we're talking about these eight hexagons down at the bottom right. The total area of those hexagons is two Greater London's worth of someone else's Sahara  and you'll need power lines all the way across Spain and France to bring the power from the Sahara to Surrey. We need a plan that adds up. We need to stop shouting and start talking  and if we can have a grown up conversation  make a plan that adds up and get building  maybe this low carbon revolution will actually be fun. Thank you very much for listening. I know this is going to sound strange  but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans. See  I grew up in Bethlehem  Pennsylvania  the home of Bethlehem Steel. My father was an engineer  and when I was growing up  he would teach me how things worked. We would build projects together  like model rockets and slot cars. Here's the go kart that we built together. That's me behind the wheel  with my sister and my best friend at the time. And one day  he came home  when I was about    years old  and at the dinner table  he announced that for our next project   we were going to build ... a robot. A robot. Now  I was thrilled about this  because at school  there was a bully named Kevin  and he was picking on me  because I was the only Jewish kid in class. So I couldn't wait to get started to work on this  so I could introduce Kevin to my robot. But that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind. See  he owned a chromium plating company  and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals. And so he needed an industrial robot like this  that could basically do the heavy lifting. But my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted  either. He and I worked on it for several years  but it was the     s  and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet. So Dad continued to do this kind of work by hand. And a few years later  he was diagnosed with cancer. You see  what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting. It was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals. He didn't recognize that at the time  and he contracted leukemia. And he died at the age of   . I was devastated by this. And I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build. When I was at college  I decided to study engineering  like him. And I went to Carnegie Mellon  and I earned my PhD in robotics. I've been studying robots ever since. So what I'd like to tell you about are four robot projects  and how they've inspired me to be a better human. By       I was a young professor at USC  and I was just building up my own robotics lab  and this was the year the World Wide Web came out. And I remember my students were the ones who told me about it  and we would    we were just amazed. We started playing with this  and that afternoon  we realized that we could use this new  universal interface to allow anyone in the world to operate the robot in our lab. So  rather than have it fight or do industrial work  we decided to build a planter  put the robot into the center of it  and we called it the Telegarden. And we had put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the robot  and we wrote some special scripts and software  so that anyone in the world could come in  and by clicking on the screen  they could move the robot around and visit the garden. But we also set up some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden  remotely. And if you watered it a few times  we'd give you your own seed to plant. Now  this was an engineering project  and we published some papers on the system design of it  but we also thought of it as an art installation. It was invited  after the first year  by the Ars Electronica Museum in Austria  to have it installed in their lobby. And I'm happy to say  it remained online there     hours a day  for almost nine years. That robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history. Now  one day  I got a call out of the blue from a student  who asked a very simple but profound question. He said   Is the robot real   Now  everyone else had assumed it was  and we knew it was  because we were working with it. But I knew what he meant  because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden and then  basically  index them in a computer system  such that it would appear that there was a real robot  when there wasn't. And the more I thought about it  I couldn't think of a good answer for how he could tell the difference. This was right about the time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley. And when I got here  I looked up Hubert Dreyfus  who's a world renowned professor of philosophy  And I talked with him about this and he said   This is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy. It goes back to the Skeptics and up through Descartes. It's the issue of epistemology  the study of how do we know that something is true.  So he and I started working together  and we coined a new term   telepistemology   the study of knowledge at a distance. We invited leading artists  engineers and philosophers to write essays about this  and the results are collected in this book from MIT Press. So thanks to this student  who questioned what everyone else had assumed to be true  this project taught me an important lesson about life  which is to always question assumptions. Now  the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the Telegarden. As it was operating  my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other  and what they were doing with the garden. So we started thinking  what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment  Like  for example  what if it could go to a dinner party at the White House  So  because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware  we decided that  rather than have a robot replace the human to go to the party  we'd have a human replace the robot. We called it the Tele Actor. We got a human  someone who's very outgoing and gregarious  and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment  cameras and microphones  and then a backpack with wireless Internet connection. And the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment  and then over the Internet  people could experience what she was experiencing. So they could see what she was seeing  but then  more importantly  they could participate  by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go  and then conveying those to the Tele Actor. So we got a chance to take the Tele Actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco. And that year  Sam Donaldson was the host. Just before the curtain went up  I had about    seconds to explain to Mr. Donaldson what we were going to do. And I said   The Tele Actor is going to be joining you onstage. This is a new experimental project  and people are watching her on their screens  there's cameras involved and there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear  and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next.  And he said   Wait a second. That's what I do.  So he loved the concept  and when the Tele Actor walked onstage  she walked right up to him  and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips. We were totally surprised    we had no idea that would happen. And he was great  he just gave her a big hug in return  and it worked out great. But that night  as we were packing up  I asked the Tele Actor  how did the Tele Directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson  And she said they hadn't. She said  when she was just about to walk onstage  the Tele Directors still were trying to agree on what to do  and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural. So  the success of the Tele Actor that night was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor. She knew when to trust her instincts. And so that project taught me another lesson about life  which is that  when in doubt  improvise. Now  the third project grew out of my experience when my father was in the hospital. He was undergoing a treatment    chemotherapy treatments    and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy  where tiny  radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors. And the way it's done  as you can see here  is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds. And all these needles are inserted in parallel. So it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs. And as a result  the needles damage these organs  cause damage  which leads to trauma and side effects. So my students and I wondered  what if we could modify the system  so that the needles could come in at different angles  So we simulated this  we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this. And we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs  and yet still achieve the coverage of the tumors with the radiation. So now  we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins  and we're building a robot that has a number of    it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles. And as you can see here  they can avoid delicate organs and still reach the targets they're aiming for. So  by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel  this project also taught me an important lesson  When in doubt  when your path is blocked  pivot. And the last project also has to do with medical robotics. And this is something that's grown out of a system called the da Vinci surgical robot. And this is a commercially available device. It's being used in over       hospitals around the world. The idea is it allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in his own coordinate frame. Many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious  like suturing  and currently  all of these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon. So the surgeon becomes fatigued over time. And we've been wondering  what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks  and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the surgery  and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster  Now  it's hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this. But it turns out my colleague Pieter Abbeel  who's here at Berkeley  has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example. So he's gotten robots to fly helicopters  do incredibly interesting  beautiful acrobatics  by watching human experts fly them. So we got one of these robots. We started working with Pieter and his students. And we asked a surgeon to perform a task    with the robot. So what we're doing is asking the surgeon to perform the task  and we record the motions of the robot. So here's an example. I'll use tracing out a figure eight as an example. So here's what it looks like when the robot    this is what the robot's path looks like  those three examples. Now  those are much better than what a novice like me could do  but they're still jerky and imprecise. So we record all these examples  the data  and then go through a sequence of steps. First  we use a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition. And this allows us to temporally align all of the examples. And then we apply Kalman filtering  a technique from control theory  that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them. Now we take those human demonstrations    they're all noisy and imperfect    and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot. We then execute that on the robot  we observe what happens  then we adjust the controls  using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning. Then what we do is we increase the velocity a little bit. We observe the results  adjust the controls again  and observe what happens. And we go through this several rounds. And here's the result. That's the inferred task trajectory  and here's the robot moving at the speed of the human. Here's four times the speed of the human. Here's seven times. And here's the robot operating at    times the speed of the human. So we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like a surgical subtask  at    times the speed of a human. So this project also  because of its involved practicing and learning  doing something over and over again  this project also has a lesson  which is  if you want to do something well  there's no substitute for practice  practice  practice. So these are four of the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years. And the field of robotics has gotten much better over time. Nowadays  high school students can build robots  like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build. But  it's very    now ... And now  I have a daughter  named Odessa. She's eight years old. And she likes robots  too. Maybe it runs in the family. I wish she could meet my dad. And now I get to teach her how things work  and we get to build projects together. And I wonder what kind of lessons she'll learn from them. Robots are the most human of our machines. They can't solve all of the world's problems  but I think they have something important to teach us. I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in  the machines that you wish for. And think about what they might be telling you. Because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations  the devices we dream about  can inspire us to be better humans. Thank you. The great texts of the ancient world don't survive to us in their original form. They survive because medieval scribes copied them and copied them and copied them. And so it is with Archimedes  the great Greek mathematician. Everything we know about Archimedes as a mathematician we know about because of just three books  and they're called A  B and C. And A was lost by an Italian humanist in     . And B was last heard of in the Pope's Library about a hundred miles north of Rome in Viterbo in     . Now Codex C was only discovered in       and it landed on my desk in Baltimore on the   th of January      . And this is Codex C here. Now Codex C is actually buried in this book. It's buried treasure. Because this book is actually a prayer book. It was finished by a guy called Johannes Myrones on the   th of April      . And to make his prayer book he used parchment. But he didn't use new parchment  he used parchment recycled from earlier manuscripts  and there were seven of them. And Archimedes Codex C was just one of those seven. He took apart the Archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts. He erased all of their texts  and then he cut the sheets down in the middle  he shuffled them up  and he rotated them    degrees  and he wrote prayers on top of these books. And essentially these seven manuscripts disappeared for     years  and we have a prayer book. The prayer book was discovered by this guy  Johan Ludvig Heiberg  in     . And with just a magnifying glass  he transcribed as much of the text as he could. And the thing is that he found two texts in this manuscript that were unique texts. They weren't in A and B at all  they were completely new texts by Archimedes  and they were called  The Method  and  The Stomachion.  And it became a world famous manuscript. Now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition. It got in worse condition in the   th century after Heiberg saw it. Forgeries were painted over it  and it suffered very badly from mold. This book is the definition of a write off. It's the sort of book that you thought would be in an institution. But it's not in an institution  it was bought by a private owner in     . Why did he buy this book  Because he wanted to make that which was fragile safe. He wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous. He wanted to make that which was expensive free. And he wanted to do this as a matter of principle. Because not many people are really going to read Archimedes in ancient Greek  but they should have the chance to do it. So he gathered around himself the friends of Archimedes  and he promised to pay for all the work. And it was an expensive job  but actually it wouldn't be as much as you think because these people  they didn't come from money  they came from Archimedes. And they came from all sorts of different backgrounds. They came from particle physics  they came from classical philology  they came from book conservation  they came from ancient mathematics  they came from data management  they came from scientific imaging and program management. And they got together to work on this manuscript. The first problem was a conservation problem. And this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with  There was glue on the spine of the book. And if you look at this photograph carefully  the bottom half of this is rather brown. And that glue is hide glue. Now if you're a conservator  you can take off this glue reasonably easily. The top half is Elmer's wood glue. It's polyvinyl acetate emulsion that doesn't dissolve in water once it's dry. And it's much tougher than the parchment that it was written on. And so before we could start imaging Archimedes  we had to take this book apart. So it took four years to take apart. And this is a rare action shot  ladies and gentlemen. Another thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax  because this was used in the liturgical services of the Greek Orthodox Church and they'd used candle wax. And the candle wax was dirty  and we couldn't image through the wax. So very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax. It's hard to tell you exactly how bad this condition of this book is  but it came out in little bits very often. And normally in a book  you wouldn't worry about the little bits  but these little bits might contain unique Archimedes text. So  tiny fragments we actually managed to put back in the right place. Then  having done that  we started to image the manuscript. And we imaged the manuscript in    different wavebands of light. Because if you look at something in different wavebands of light  you see different things. And here is an image of a page imaged in    different wavebands of light. But none of them worked. So what we did was we processed the images together  and we put two images into one blank screen. And here are two different images of the Archimedes manuscript. And the image on the left is the normal red image. And the image on the right is an ultraviolet image. And in the image on the right you might be able to see some of the Archimedes writing. If you merge them together into one digital canvas  the parchment is bright in both images and it comes out bright. The prayer book is dark in both images and it comes out dark. The Archimedes text is dark in one image and bright in another. And it'll come out dark but red  and then you can start to read it rather clearly. And that's what it looks like. Now that's a before and after image  but you don't read the image on the screen like that. You zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in  and you can just read it now. If you process the same two images in a different way  you can actually get rid of the prayer book text. And this is terribly important  because the diagrams in the manuscript are the unique source for the diagrams that Archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth century B.C. And there we are  I can give them to you. With this kind of imaging    this kind of infrared  ultraviolet  invisible light imaging    we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries. How were we going to do that  Well we took the manuscript  and we decided to image it in X ray fluorescence imaging. So an X ray comes in in the diagram on the left and it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom. And that electron disappears. And as it disappears  an electron from a shell farther out jumps in and takes its place. And when it takes its place  it sheds electromagnetic radiation. It sheds an X ray. And this X ray is specific in its wavelength to the atom that it hits. And what we wanted to get was the iron. Because the ink was written in iron. And if we can map where this X ray that comes out  where it comes from  we can map all the iron on the page  then theoretically we can read the image. The thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this. So we took it to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory in California  which is a particle accelerator. Electrons go around one way  positrons go around the other. They meet in the middle  and they create subatomic particles like the charm quark and the tau lepton. Now we weren't actually going to put Archimedes in that beam. But as the electrons go round at the speed of light  they shed X rays. And this is the most powerful light source in the solar system. This is called synchrotron radiation  and it's normally used to look at things like proteins and that sort of thing. But we wanted it to look at atoms  at iron atoms  so that we could read the page from before and after. And lo and behold  we found that we could do it. It took about    minutes to do a single page. So what did we discover  Well one of the unique texts in Archimedes is called  The Stomachion.  And this didn't exist in Codices A and B. And we knew that it involved this square. And this is a perfect square  and it's divided into    bits. But no one knew what Archimedes was doing with these    bits. And now we think we know. He was trying to work out how many ways you can recombine those    bits and still make a perfect square. Anyone want to guess the answer  It's        divided into     families. And the important point about this is that it's the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics. And combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics. The really astonishing thing though about this manuscript is that we looked at the other manuscripts that the palimpsester had made  the scribe had made his book out of  and one of them was a manuscript containing text by Hyperides. Now Hyperides was an Athenian orator from the fourth century B.C. He was an exact contemporary of Demosthenes. And in     B.C. he and Demosthenes together decided that they wanted to stand up to the military might of Philip of Macedon. So Athens and Thebes went out to fight Philip of Macedon. This was a bad idea  because Philip of Macedon had a son called Alexander the Great  and they lost the battle of Chaeronea. Alexander the Great went on to conquer the known world  Hyperides found himself on trial for treason. And this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial    and it's a great speech   Best of all   he says   is to win. But if you can't win  then you should fight for a noble cause  because then you'll be remembered. Consider the Spartans. They won enumerable victories  but no one remembers what they are because they were all fought for selfish ends. The one battle that the Spartans fought that everybody remembers is the the battle of Thermopylae where they were butchered to a man  but fought for the freedom of Greece.  It was such a great speech that the Athenian law courts let him off. He lived for another    years  then the Macedonian faction caught up with him. They cut out his tongue in mockery of his oratory  and no one knows what they did with his body. So this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity  speaking to us  not from the grave  because his grave doesn't exist  but from the Athenian law courts. Now I should say at this point that normally when you're looking at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off  you don't find unique texts. And to find two in one manuscript is really something. To find three is completely weird. And we found three. Aristotle's  Categories  is one of the foundational texts of Western philosophy. And we found a third century A.D. commentary on it  possibly by Galen and probably by Porphyry. Now all this data that we collected  all the images  all the raw images  all the transcriptions that we made and that sort of thing have been put online under a Creative Commons license for anyone to use for any commercial purpose. Why did the owner of the manuscript do this  He did this because he understands data as well as books. Now the thing to do with books  if you want to ensure their long term utility  is to hide them away in closets and let very few people look at them. The thing to do with data  if you want it to survive  is to let it out and have everybody have it with as little control on that data as possible. And that's what he did. And institutions can learn from this. Because institutions at the moment confine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing. And if you want to look at medieval manuscripts on the Web  at the moment you have to go to the National Library of Y's site or the University Library of X's site  which is about the most boring way in which you can deal with digital data. What you want to do is to aggregate it all together. Because the Web of the ancient manuscripts of the future isn't going to be built by institutions. It's going to be built by users  by people who get this data together  by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps from wherever they come from  all sorts of medieval romances from wherever they come from  people who just want to curate their own glorious selection of beautiful things. And that is the future of the Web. And it's an attractive and beautiful future  if only we can make it happen. Now we at the Walters Art Museum have followed this example  and we have put up all our manuscripts on the Web for people to enjoy    all the raw data  all the descriptions  all the metadata. under a Creative Commons license. Now the Walters Art Museum is a small museum and it has beautiful manuscripts  but the data is fantastic. And the result of this is that if you do a Google search on images right now and you type in  Illuminated manuscript Koran  for example     of the    images you'll find come from my institution. Now  let's think about this for a minute. What's in it for the institution  There are all sorts of things that are in it for the institution. You can talk about the Humanities and that sort of thing  but let's talk about selfish things. Because what's really in it for the institution is this  Now why do people go to the Louvre  They go to see the Mona Lisa. Why do they go to see the Mona Lisa  Because they already know what she looks like. And they know what she looks like because they've seen pictures of her absolutely everywhere. Now  there is no need for these restrictions at all. And I think that institutions should stand up and release all their data under unrestricted licenses  and it would be a great benefit to everybody. Why don't we just let everybody have access to this data and curate their own collection of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things and increase the beauty and the cultural significance of the Internet. Thank you very much indeed. My talk today is about something maybe a couple of you have already heard about. It's called the Arab Spring. Anyone heard of it  So in       power shifted  from the few to the many  from oval offices to central squares  from carefully guarded airwaves to open source networks. But before Tahrir was a global symbol of liberation  there were representative surveys already giving people a voice in quieter but still powerful ways. I study Muslim societies around the world at Gallup. Since       we've interviewed hundreds of thousands of people    young and old  men and women  educated and illiterate. My talk today draws on this research to reveal why Arabs rose up and what they want now. Now this region's very diverse  and every country is unique. But those who revolted shared a common set of grievances and have similar demands today. I'm going to focus a lot of my talk on Egypt. It has nothing to do with the fact that I was born there  of course. But it's the largest Arab country and it's also one with a great deal of influence. But I'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region to look at the mundane topics of Arab views of religion and politics and how this impacts women  revealing some surprises along the way. So after analyzing mounds of data  what we discovered was this  Unemployment and poverty alone did not lead to the Arab revolts of     . If an act of desperation by a Tunisian fruit vendor sparked these revolutions  it was the difference between what Arabs experienced and what they expected that provided the fuel. To tell you what I mean  consider this trend in Egypt. On paper the country was doing great. In fact  it attracted accolades from multinational organizations because of its economic growth. But under the surface was a very different reality. In       right before the revolution  even though GDP per capita had been growing at five percent for several years  Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives. Now this is very unusual  because globally we find that  not surprisingly  people feel better as their country gets richer. And that's because they have better job opportunities and their state offers better social services. But it was exactly the opposite in Egypt. As the country got more well off  unemployment actually rose and people's satisfaction with things like housing and education plummeted. But it wasn't just anger at economic injustice. It was also people's deep longing for freedom. Contrary to the clash of civilizations theory  Arabs didn't despise Western liberty  they desired it. As early as       we asked Arabs  and Muslims in general around the world  what they admired most about the West. Among the most frequent responses was liberty and justice. In their own words to an open ended question we heard   Their political system is transparent and it's following democracy in its true sense.  Another said it was  liberty and freedom and being open minded with each other.  Majorities as high as    percent and greater in Egypt  Indonesia and Iran told us in      that if they were to write a new constitution for a theoretical new country that they would guarantee freedom of speech as a fundamental right  especially in Egypt. Eighty eight percent said moving toward greater democracy would help Muslims progress    the highest percentage of any country we surveyed. But pressed up against these democratic aspirations was a very different day to day experience  especially in Egypt. While aspiring to democracy the most  they were the least likely population in the world to say that they had actually voiced their opinion to a public official in the last month    at only four percent. So while economic development made a few people rich  it left many more worse off. As people felt less and less free  they also felt less and less provided for. So rather than viewing their former regimes as generous if overprotective fathers  they viewed them as essentially prison wardens. So now that Egyptians have ended Mubarak's    year rule  they potentially could be an example for the region. If Egypt is to succeed at building a society based on the rule of law  it could be a model. If  however  the core issues that propelled the revolution aren't addressed  the consequences could be catastrophic    not just for Egypt  but for the entire region. The signs don't look good  some have said. Islamists  not the young liberals that sparked the revolution  won the majority in Parliament. The military council has cracked down on civil society and protests and the country's economy continues to suffer. Evaluating Egypt on this basis alone  however  ignores the real revolution. Because Egyptians are more optimistic than they have been in years  far less divided on religious secular lines than we would think and poised for the demands of democracy. Whether they support Islamists or liberals  Egyptians' priorities for this government are identical  and they are jobs  stability and education  not moral policing. But most of all  for the first time in decades  they expect to be active participants  not spectators  in the affairs of their country. I was meeting with a group of newly elected parliamentarians from Egypt and Tunisia a couple of weeks ago. And what really struck me about them was that they weren't only optimistic  but they kind of struck me as nervous  for lack of a better word. One said to me   Our people used to gather in cafes to watch football     or soccer  as we say in America     and now they gather to watch Parliament.   They're really watching us  and we can't help but worry that we're not going to live up to their expectations.  And what really struck me is that less than    months ago  it was the people that were nervous about being watched by their government. And the reason that they're expecting a lot is because they have a new found hope for the future. So right before the revolution we said that Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives  but not only that  they thought their future would be no better. What really changed after the ouster of Mubarak wasn't that life got easier. It actually got harder. But people's expectations for their future went up significantly. And this hope  this optimism  endured a year of turbulent transition. One reason that there's this optimism is because  contrary to what many people have said  most Egyptians think things really have changed in many ways. So while Egyptians were known for their single digit turnout in elections before the revolution  the last election had around    percent voter turnout    men and women. Where scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in         I'm surprised it was a quarter       percent thought that this last election was honest. Now why this matters is because we discovered a link between people's faith in their democratic process and their faith that oppressed people can change their situation through peaceful means alone. Now I know what some of you are thinking. The Egyptian people  and many other Arabs who've revolted and are in transition  have very high expectations of the government. They're just victims of a long time autocracy  expecting a paternal state to solve all their problems. But this conclusion would ignore a tectonic shift taking place in Egypt far from the cameras in Tahrir Square. And that is Egyptians' elevated expectations are placed first on themselves. In the country once known for its passive resignation  where  as bad as things got  only four percent expressed their opinion to a public official  today    percent tell us that if there's a problem in their community  it's up to them to fix it. And three fourths believe they not only have the responsibility  but the power to make change. And this empowerment also applies to women  whose role in the revolts cannot be underestimated. They were doctors and dissidents  artists and organizers. A full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas to ask or to demand liberty and justice in Egypt were women. Now people have raised some real concerns about what the rise of Islamist parties means for women. What we've found about the role of religion in law and the role of religion in society is that there's no female consensus. We found that women in one country look more like the men in that country than their female counterparts across the border. Now what this suggests is that how women view religion's role in society is shaped more by their own country's culture and context than one monolithic view that religion is simply bad for women. Where women agree  however  is on their own role  and that it must be central and active. And here is where we see the greatest gender difference within a country    on the issue of women's rights. Now how men feel about women's rights matters to the future of this region. Because we discovered a link between men's support for women's employment and how many women are actually employed in professional fields in that country. So the question becomes  What drives men's support for women's rights  What about men's views of religion and law   Does  a man's opinion of the role of religion in politics shape their view of women's rights  The answer is no. We found absolutely no correlation  no impact whatsoever  between these two variables. What drives men's support for women's employment is men's employment  their level of education as well as a high score on their country's U.N. Human Development Index. What this means is that human development  not secularization  is what's key to women's empowerment in the transforming Middle East. And the transformation continues. From Wall Street to Mohammed Mahmoud Street  it has never been more important to understand the aspirations of ordinary people. Thank you. We are today talking about moral persuasion. What is moral and immoral in trying to change people's behaviors by using technology and using design  And I don't know what you expect  but when I was thinking about that issue  I early on realized what I'm not able to give you are answers. I'm not able to tell you what is moral or immoral because we're living in a pluralist society. My values can be radically different from your values. Which means that what I consider moral or immoral based on that might not necessarily be what you consider moral or immoral. But I also realized that there is one thing that I could give you. And that is what this guy behind me gave the world    Socrates. It is questions. What I can do and what I would like to do with you is give you  like that initial question  a set of questions to figure out for yourself  layer by layer  like peeling an onion  getting at the core of what you believe is moral or immoral persuasion. And I'd like to do that with a couple of examples of technologies where people have used game elements to get people to do things. So it's a first very simple  a very obvious question I would like to give you  What are your intentions if you are designing something  And obviously intentions are not the only thing  so here is another example for one of these applications. There are a couple of these kinds of eco dashboards right now    so dashboards built into cars which try to motivate you to drive more fuel efficiently. This here is Nissan's MyLeaf  where your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior of other people  so you can compete for who drives around the most fuel efficiently. And these things are very effective  it turns out  so effective that they motivate people to engage in unsafe driving behaviors    like not stopping on a red headlight. Because that way you have to stop and restart the engine  and that would use quite some fuel  wouldn't it  So despite this being a very well intended application  obviously there was a side effect of that. And here's another example for one of these side effects. Commendable  a site that allows parents to give their kids little badges for doing the things that parents want their kids to do    like tying their shoes. And at first that sounds very nice  very benign  well intended. But it turns out  if you look into research on people's mindset  that caring about outcomes  caring about public recognition  caring about these kinds of public tokens of recognition is not necessarily very helpful for your long term psychological well being. It's better if you care about learning something. It's better when you care about yourself than how you appear in front of other people. So that kind of motivational tool that is used actually in and of itself has a long term side effect in that every time we use a technology that uses something like public recognition or status  we're actually positively endorsing this as a good and a normal thing to care about    that way  possibly having a detrimental effect on the long term psychological well being of ourselves as a culture. So that's a second  very obvious question  What are the effects of what you're doing  The effects that you're having with the device  like less fuel  as well as the effects of the actual tools you're using to get people to do things    public recognition. Now is that all    intention  effect  Well there are some technologies which obviously combine both. Both good long term and short term effects and a positive intention like Fred Stutzman's Freedom  where the whole point of that application is  well  we're usually so bombarded with calls and requests by other people  with this device you can shut off the Internet connectivity of your PC of choice for a preset amount of time to actually get some work done. And I think most of us will agree  well that's something well intended and also has good consequences. In the words of Michel Foucault   It is a technology of the self.  It is a technology that empowers the individual to determine its own life course  to shape itself. But the problem is  as Foucault points out  that every technology of the self has a technology of domination as its flip side. As you see in today's modern liberal democracies  the society  the state  not only allows us to determine our self  to shape our self  it also demands it of us. It demands that we optimize ourselves  that we control ourselves  that we self manage continuously because that's the only way in which such a liberal society works. These technologies want us to stay in the game that society has devised for us. They want us to fit in even better. They want us to optimize ourselves to fit in. Now I don't say that is necessarily a bad thing. I just think that this example points us to a general realization  and that is no matter what technology or design you look at  even something we consider as well intended and as good in its effects    like Stutzman's Freedom    comes with certain values embedded in it. And we can question these values. We can question  Is it a good thing that all of us continuously self optimize ourselves to fit better into that society  Or to give you another example  what about a piece of persuasive technology that convinces Muslim women to wear their headscarves  Is that a good or a bad technology in its intentions or in its effects  Well that basically depends on the kind of values that you bring to bear to make these kinds of judgments. So that's a third question  What values do you use to judge  And speaking of values  I've noticed that in the discussion about moral persuasion online  and when I'm talking with people  more often than not there is a weird bias. And that bias is that we're asking  is this or that  still  ethical  Is it  still  permissible  We're asking things like  Is this Oxfam donation form    where the regular monthly donation is the preset default and people  maybe without intending it  are that way encouraged or nudged into giving a regular donation instead of a one time donation    is that still permissible  Is it still ethical  We're fishing at the low end. But in fact  that question  Is it still ethical   is just one way of looking at ethics. Because if you look at the beginning of ethics in Western culture  you see a very different idea of what ethics also could be. For Aristotle  ethics was not about the question  is that still good  or is it bad  Ethics was about the question of how to live life well. And he put that in the word  arete   which we  from the  Ancient Greek   translate as  virtue.  But really it means excellence. It means living up to your own full potential as a human being. And that is an idea that  I think  that Paul Richard Buchanan nicely put in a recent essay where he said   Products are vivid arguments about how we should live our lives.  Our designs are not ethical or unethical in that they're using ethical or unethical means of persuading us. They have a moral component just in the kind of vision and the aspiration of the good life that they present to us. And if you look into the designed environment around us with that kind of lens  asking   What is the vision of the good life that our products  our design  present to us    then you often get the shivers  because of how little we expect of each other  of how little we actually seem to expect of our life and what the good life looks like. So that's the fourth question I'd like to leave you with  What vision of the good life do your designs convey  And speaking of design  you notice that I already broadened the discussion. Because it's not just persuasive technology that we're talking about here  it's any piece of design that we put out here in the world. I don't know whether you know the great communication researcher Paul Watzlawick who  back in the '  s  made the argument we cannot not communicate. Even if we choose to be silent  we chose to be silent. We're communicating something by choosing to be silent. And in the same way that we cannot not communicate  we cannot not persuade. Whatever we do or refrain from doing  whatever we put out there as a piece of design into the world has a persuasive component. It tries to affect people. It puts a certain vision of the good life out there in front of us. Which is what Peter Paul Verbeek  the Dutch philosopher of technology  says. No matter whether we as designers intend it or not  we materialize morality. We make certain things harder and easier to do. We organize the existence of people. We put a certain vision of what good or bad or normal or usual is in front of people by everything we put out there in the world. Even something as innocuous as a set of school chairs is a persuasive technology. Because it presents and materializes a certain vision of the good life    the good life in which teaching and learning and listening is about one person teaching  the others listening  in which it is about  learning is done while sitting  in which you learn for yourself  in which you're not supposed to change these rules because the chairs are fixed to the ground. And even something as innocuous as a single design chair    like this one by Arne Jacobsen    is a persuasive technology. Because  again  it communicates an idea of the good life. A good life    a life that you say you as a designer consent to by saying   In the good life  goods are produced as sustainably or unsustainably as this chair. Workers are treated as well or as badly as the workers were treated who built that chair.  The good life is a life where design is important because somebody obviously took the time and spent the money for that kind of well designed chair  where tradition is important because this is a traditional classic and someone cared about this  and where there is something as conspicuous consumption  where it is okay and normal to spend a humungous amount of money on such a chair to signal to other people what your social status is. So these are the kinds of layers  the kinds of questions I wanted to lead you through today    the question of  What are the intentions that you bring to bear when you're designing something  What are the effects  intended and unintended  that you're having  What are the values you're using to judge those  What are the virtues  the aspirations that you're actually expressing in that  And how does that apply  not just to persuasive technology  but to everything you design  Do we stop there  I don't think so. I think that all of these things are eventually informed by the core of all of this    and this is nothing but life itself. Why  when the question of what the good life is informs everything that we design  should we stop at design and not ask ourselves  how does it apply to our own life   Why should the lamp or the house be an art object  but not our life   as Michel Foucault puts it. Just to give you a practical example of Buster Benson. This is Buster setting up a pull up machine at the office of his new startup Habit Labs  where they're trying to build up other applications like Health Month for people. And why is he building a thing like this  Well here is the set of axioms that Habit Labs  Buster's startup  put up for themselves on how they wanted to work together as a team when they're building these applications    a set of moral principles they set themselves for working together    and one of them being   We take care of our own health and manage our own burnout.  Because ultimately how can you ask yourselves and how can you find an answer on what vision of the good life you want to convey and create with your designs without asking the question  what vision of the good life do you yourself want to live  And with that  I thank you. Is E.T. out there  Well  I work at the SETI Institute. That's almost my name. SETI  Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. In other words  I look for aliens  and when I tell people that at a cocktail party  they usually look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face. I try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate. Now  a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic  ridiculous  maybe even hopeless  but I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think that the job I have is actually a privilege  okay  and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into this line of work  if that's what you call it. This thing   whoops  can we go back  Hello  come in  Earth. There we go. All right. This is the Owens Valley Radio Observatory behind the Sierra Nevadas  and in       I was working there collecting data for my thesis. Now  it's kinda lonely  it's kinda tedious  just collecting data  so I would amuse myself by taking photos at night of the telescopes or even of myself  because  you know  at night  I would be the only hominid within about    miles. So here are pictures of myself. The observatory had just acquired a new book  written by a Russian cosmologist by the name of Joseph Shklovsky  and then expanded and translated and edited by a little known Cornell astronomer by the name of Carl Sagan. And I remember reading that book  and at   in the morning I was reading this book and it was explaining how the antennas I was using to measure the spins of galaxies could also be used to communicate  to send bits of information from one star system to another. Now  at   o'clock in the morning when you're all alone  haven't had much sleep  that was a very romantic idea  but it was that idea    the fact that you could in fact prove that there's somebody out there just using this same technology    that appealed to me so much that    years later I took a job at the SETI Institute. Now  I have to say that my memory is notoriously porous  and I've often wondered whether there was any truth in this story  or I was just  you know  misremembering something  but I recently just blew up this old negative of mine  and sure enough  there you can see the Shklovsky and Sagan book underneath that analog calculating device. So it was true. All right. Now  the idea for doing this  it wasn't very old at the time that I made that photo. The idea dates from       when a young astronomer by the name of Frank Drake used this antenna in West Virginia  pointed it at a couple of nearby stars in the hopes of eavesdropping on E.T. Now  Frank didn't hear anything. Actually he did  but it turned out to be the U.S. Air Force  which doesn't count as extraterrestrial intelligence. But Drake's idea here became very popular because it was very appealing   and I'll get back to that   and on the basis of this experiment  which didn't succeed  we have been doing SETI ever since  not continuously  but ever since. We still haven't heard anything. We still haven't heard anything. In fact  we don't know about any life beyond Earth  but I'm going to suggest to you that that's going to change rather soon  and part of the reason  in fact  the majority of the reason why I think that's going to change is that the equipment's getting better. This is the Allen Telescope Array  about     miles from whatever seat you're in right now. This is something that we're using today to search for E.T.  and the electronics have gotten very much better too. This is Frank Drake's electronics in     . This is the Allen Telescope Array electronics today. Some pundit with too much time on his hands has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately     trillion times better than they were in           trillion times better. That's a degree of an improvement that would look good on your report card  okay  But something that's not appreciated by the public is  in fact  that the experiment continues to get better  and  consequently  tends to get faster. This is a little plot  and every time you show a plot  you lose    percent of the audience. I have    of these.  Laughter  But what I plotted here is just some metric that shows how fast we're searching. In other words  we're looking for a needle in a haystack. We know how big the haystack is. It's the galaxy. But we're going through the haystack no longer with a teaspoon but with a skip loader  because of this increase in speed. In fact  those of you who are still conscious and mathematically competent  will note that this is a semi log plot. In other words  the rate of increase is exponential. It's exponentially improving. Now  exponential is an overworked word. You hear it on the media all the time. They don't really know what exponential means  but this is exponential. In fact  it's doubling every    months  and  of course  every card carrying member of the digerati knows that that's Moore's Law. So this means that over the course of the next two dozen years  we'll be able to look at a million star systems  a million star systems  looking for signals that would prove somebody's out there. Well  a million star systems  is that interesting  I mean  how many of those star systems have planets  And the facts are  we didn't know the answer to that even as recently as    years ago  and in fact  we really didn't know it even as recently as six months ago. But now we do. Recent results suggest that virtually every star has planets  and more than one. They're like  you know  kittens. You get a litter. You don't get one kitten. You get a bunch. So in fact  this is a pretty accurate estimate of the number of planets in our galaxy  just in our galaxy  by the way  and I remind the non astronomy majors among you that our galaxy is only one of     billion that we can see with our telescopes. That's a lot of real estate  but of course  most of these planets are going to be kind of worthless  like  you know  Mercury  or Neptune. Neptune's probably not very big in your life. So the question is  what fraction of these planets are actually suitable for life  We don't know the answer to that either  but we will learn that answer this year  thanks to NASA's Kepler Space Telescope  and in fact  the smart money  which is to say the people who work on this project  the smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets that might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand  one in a hundred  something like that. Well  even taking the pessimistic estimate  that it's one in a thousand  that means that there are at least a billion cousins of the Earth just in our own galaxy. Okay  now I've given you a lot of numbers here  but they're mostly big numbers  okay  so  you know  keep that in mind. There's plenty of real estate  plenty of real estate in the universe  and if we're the only bit of real estate in which there's some interesting occupants  that makes you a miracle  and I know you like to think you're a miracle  but if you do science  you learn rather quickly that every time you think you're a miracle  you're wrong  so probably not the case. All right  so the bottom line is this  Because of the increase in speed  and because of the vast amount of habitable real estate in the cosmos  I figure we're going to pick up a signal within two dozen years. And I feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you  Either we're going to find E.T. in the next two dozen years  or I'll buy you a cup of coffee. So that's not so bad. I mean  even with two dozen years  you open up your browser and there's news of a signal  or you get a cup of coffee. Now  let me tell you about some aspect of this that people don't think about  and that is  what happens  Suppose that what I say is true. I mean  who knows  but suppose it happens. Suppose some time in the next two dozen years we pick up a faint line that tells us we have some cosmic company. What is the effect  What's the consequence  Now  I might be at ground zero for this. I happen to know what the consequence for me would be  because we've had false alarms. This is       and this is a photo I made at about   o'clock in the morning in Mountain View here  when we were watching the computer monitors because we had picked up a signal that we thought   This is the real deal.  All right  And I kept waiting for the Men in Black to show up. Right  I kept waiting for    I kept waiting for my mom to call  somebody to call  the government to call. Nobody called. Nobody called. I was so nervous that I couldn't sit down. I just wandered around taking photos like this one  just for something to do. Well  at      in the morning  with my head down on my desk because I obviously hadn't slept all night  the phone rings and it's The New York Times. And I think there's a lesson in that  and that lesson is that if we pick up a signal  the media  the media will be on it faster than a weasel on ball bearings. It's going to be fast. You can be sure of that. No secrecy. That's what happens to me. It kind of ruins my whole week  because whatever I've got planned that week is kind of out the window. But what about you  What's it going to do to you  And the answer is that we don't know the answer. We don't know what that's going to do to you  not in the long term  and not even very much in the short term. I mean  that would be a bit like asking Chris Columbus in        Hey Chris  you know  what happens if it turns out that there's a continent between here and Japan  where you're sailing to  what will be the consequences for humanity if that turns out to be the case   And I think Chris would probably offer you some answer that you might not have understood  but it probably wouldn't have been right  and I think that to predict what finding E.T.'s going to mean  we can't predict that either. But here are a couple things I can say. To begin with  it's going to be a society that's way in advance of our own. You're not going to hear from alien Neanderthals. They're not building transmitters. They're going to be ahead of us  maybe by a few thousand years  maybe by a few millions years  but substantially ahead of us  and that means  if you can understand anything that they're going to say  then you might be able to short circuit history by getting information from a society that's way beyond our own. Now  you might find that a bit hyperbolic  and maybe it is  but nonetheless  it's conceivable that this will happen  and  you know  you could consider this like  I don't know  giving Julius Caesar English lessons and the key to the library of Congress. It would change his day  all right  That's one thing. Another thing that's for sure going to happen is that it will calibrate us. We will know that we're not that miracle  right  that we're just another duck in a row  we're not the only kids on the block  and I think that that's philosophically a very profound thing to learn. We're not a miracle  okay  The third thing that it might tell you is somewhat vague  but I think interesting and important  and that is  if you find a signal coming from a more advanced society  because they will be  that will tell you something about our own possibilities  that we're not inevitably doomed to self destruction. Because they survived their technology  we could do it too. Normally when you look out into the universe  you're looking back in time. All right  That's interesting to cosmologists. But in this sense  you actually can look into the future  hazily  but you can look into the future. So those are all the sorts of things that would come from a detection. Now  let me talk a little bit about something that happens even in the meantime  and that is  SETI  I think  is important  because it's exploration  and it's not only exploration  it's comprehensible exploration. Now  I gotta tell you  I'm always reading books about explorers. I find exploration very interesting  Arctic exploration  you know  people like Magellan  Amundsen  Shackleton  you see Franklin down there  Scott  all these guys. It's really nifty  exploration. And they're just doing it because they want to explore  and you might say   Oh  that's kind of a frivolous opportunity   but that's not frivolous. That's not a frivolous activity  because  I mean  think of ants. You know  most ants are programmed to follow one another along in a long line  but there are a couple of ants  maybe one percent of those ants  that are what they call pioneer ants  and they're the ones that wander off. They're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop. You gotta get them with your thumb before they find the sugar or something. But those ants  even though most of them get wiped out  those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival of the hive. So exploration is important. I also think that exploration is important in terms of being able to address what I think is a critical lack in our society  and that is the lack of science literacy  the lack of the ability to even understand science. Now  look  a lot has been written about the deplorable state of science literacy in this country. You've heard about it. Well  here's one example  in fact. Polls taken  this poll was taken    years ago. It shows like roughly one third of the public thinks that aliens are not only out there  we're looking for them out there  but they're here  right  Sailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of. Well  that would be interesting if it was true  and job security for me  but I don't think the evidence is very good. That's more  you know  sad than significant. But there are other things that people believe that are significant  like the efficacy of homeopathy  or that evolution is just  you know  sort of a crazy idea by scientists without any legs  or  you know  evolution  all that sort of thing  or global warming. These sorts of ideas don't really have any validity  that you can't trust the scientists. Now  we've got to solve that problem  because that's a critically important problem  and you might say   Well  okay  how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI   Well  let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't solve the problem  but it can address the problem. It can address the problem by getting young people interested in science. Look  science is hard  it has a reputation of being hard  and the facts are  it is hard  and that's the result of     years of science  right  I mean  in the   th century  in the   th century you could become an expert on any field of science in an afternoon by going to a library  if you could find the library  right  In the   th century  if you had a basement lab  you could make major scientific discoveries in your own home. Right  Because there was all this science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up. Now  that's not true anymore. Today  you've got to spend years in grad school and post doc positions just to figure out what the important questions are. It's hard. There's no doubt about it. And in fact  here's an example  the Higgs boson  finding the Higgs boson. Ask the next    people you see on the streets   Hey  do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions of Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson   And I bet the answer you're going to get  is   Well  I don't know what the Higgs boson is  and I don't know if it's important.  And probably most of the people wouldn't even know the value of a Swiss franc  okay  And yet we're spending billions of Swiss francs on this problem. Okay  So that doesn't get people interested in science because they can't comprehend what it's about. SETI  on the other hand  is really simple. We're going to use these big antennas and we're going to try to eavesdrop on signals. Everybody can understand that. Yes  technologically  it's very sophisticated  but everybody gets the idea. So that's one thing. The other thing is  it's exciting science. It's exciting because we're naturally interested in other intelligent beings  and I think that's part of our hardwiring. I mean  we're hardwired to be interested in beings that might be  if you will  competitors  or if you're the romantic sort  possibly even mates. Okay  I mean  this is analogous to our interest in things that have big teeth. Right  We're interested in things that have big teeth  and you can see the evolutionary value of that  and you can also see the practical consequences by watching Animal Planet. You notice they make very few programs about gerbils. It's mostly about things that have big teeth. Okay  so we're interested in these sorts of things. And not just us. It's also kids. This allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science  because SETI involves all kinds of science  obviously biology  obviously astronomy  but also geology  also chemistry  various scientific disciplines all can be presented in the guise of   We're looking for E.T.  So to me this is interesting and important  and in fact  it's my policy  even though I give a lot of talks to adults  you give talks to adults  and two days later they're back where they were. But if you give talks to kids  you know  one in    of them  some light bulb goes off  and they think   Gee  I'd never thought of that   and then they go  you know  read a book or a magazine or whatever. They get interested in something. Now it's my theory  supported only by anecdotal  personal anecdotal evidence  but nonetheless  that kids get interested in something between the ages of eight and   . You've got to get them there. So  all right  I give talks to adults  that's fine  but I try and make    percent of the talks that I give  I try and make those for kids. I remember when a guy came to our high school  actually  it was actually my junior high school. I was in sixth grade. And he gave some talk. All I remember from it was one word  electronics. It was like Dustin Hoffman in  The Graduate   right  when he said  plastics   whatever that means  plastics. All right  so the guy said electronics. I don't remember anything else. In fact  I don't remember anything that my sixth grade teacher said all year  but I remember electronics. And so I got interested in electronics  and you know  I studied to get my ham license. I was wiring up stuff. Here I am at about    or something  doing that sort of stuff. Okay  That had a big effect on me. So that's my point  that you can have a big effect on these kids. In fact  this reminds me  I don't know  a couple years ago I gave a talk at a school in Palo Alto where there were about a dozen    year olds that had come to this talk. I had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour. Eleven year olds  they're all sitting in a little semi circle looking up at me with big eyes  and I started  there was a white board behind me  and I started off by writing a one with    zeroes after it  and I said   All right  now look  this is the number of stars in the visible universe  and this number is so big there's not even a name for it.  And one of these kids shot up his hand  and he said   Well  actually there is a name for it. It's a sextra quadra hexa something or other.  Right  Now  that kid was wrong by four orders of magnitude  but there was no doubt about it  these kids were smart. Okay  So I stopped giving the lecture. All they wanted to do was ask questions. In fact  my last comments to these kids  at the end I said   You know  you kids are smarter than the people I work with.  Now    Laughter  They didn't even care about that. What they wanted was my email address so they could ask me more questions.  Laughter  Let me just say  look  my job is a privilege because we're in a special time. Previous generations couldn't do this experiment at all. In another generation down the line  I think we will have succeeded. So to me  it is a privilege  and when I look in the mirror  the facts are that I really don't see myself. What I see is the generation behind me. These are some kids from the Huff School  fourth graders. I talked there  what  two weeks ago  something like that. I think that if you can instill some interest in science and how it works  well  that's a payoff beyond easy measure. Thank you very much. So I thought I'd talk about identity. That's sort of an interesting enough topic to me. And the reason was  because when I was asked to do this  I'd just read  in one of the papers  I can't remember  something from someone at Facebook saying  well   we need to make everybody use their real names.  and then that's basically all the problems solved. And that's so wrong  that's such a fundamentally  reactionary view of identity  and it's going to get us into all sorts of trouble. And so what I thought I'd do is I'll explain four sort of problems about it  and then I'll suggest a solution  which hopefully you might find interesting. So just to frame the problem  what does authenticity mean  That's me  that's a camera phone picture of me looking at a painting.  What's the Problem   That's a painting that was painted by a very famous forger  and because I'm not very good at presentations  I already can't remember the name that I wrote on my card. And he was incarcerated in  I think  Wakefield Prison for forging masterpieces by  I think  French Impressionists. And he's so good at it  that when he was in prison  everybody in prison  the governor and whatever  wanted him to paint masterpieces to put on the walls  because they were so good. And so that's a masterpiece  which is a fake of a masterpiece  and bonded into the canvas is a chip which identifies that as a real fake  if you see what I mean. So when we're talking about authenticity  it's a little more fractal than it appears and that's a good example to show it. I tried to pick four problems that will frame the issue properly. So the first problem  I thought  Chip and PIN  right   Banks and legacies bringing down the system from within   Offline solutions do not work online  I'm guessing everyone's got a chip and PIN card  right  So why is that a good example  That's the example of how legacy thinking about identity subverts the security of a well constructed system. That chip and PIN card that's in your pocket has a little chip on it that cost millions of pounds to develop  is extremely secure  you can put scanning electron microscopes on it  you can try and grind it down  blah blah blah. Those chips have never been broken  whatever you read in the paper. And for a joke  we take that super secure chip and we bond it to a trivially counterfeitable magnetic stripe and for very lazy criminals  we still emboss the card. So if you're a criminal in a hurry and you need to copy someone's card  you can just stick a piece of paper on it and rub a pencil over it just to sort of speed things up. And even more amusingly  and on my debit card too  we print the name and the SALT code and everything else on the front too. Why  There is no earthly reason why your name is printed on a chip and PIN card. And if you think about it  it's even more insidious and perverse than it seems at first. Because the only people that benefit from having the name on the card are criminals. You know what your name is  right  And when you go into a shop and buy something  it's a PIN  he doesn't care what the name is. The only place where you ever have to write your name on the back is in America at the moment. And whenever I go to America  and I have to pay with a mag stripe on the back of the card  I always sign it Carlos Tethers anyway  just as a security mechanism  because if a transaction ever gets disputed  and it comes back and it says Dave Birch  I know it must have been a criminal  because I would never sign it Dave Birch. So if you drop your card in the street  it means a criminal can pick it up and read it. They know the name  from the name they can find the address  and then they can go off and buy stuff online. Why do we put the name on the card  Because we think identity is something to do with names  and because we're rooted in the idea of the identity card  which obsesses us. And I know it crashed and burned a couple of years ago  but if you're someone in politics or the home office or whatever  and you think about identity  you can only think of identity in terms of cards with names on them. And that's very subversive in a modern world. So the second example I thought I'd use is chatrooms.  Chatrooms and Children  I'm very proud of that picture  that's my son playing in his band with his friends for the first ever gig  I believe you call it  where he got paid. And I love that picture. I like the picture of him getting into medical school a lot better  I like that picture for the moment. Why do I use that picture  Because that was very interesting  watching that experience as an old person. So him and his friends  they get together  they booked a room  like a church hall  and they got all their friends who had bands  and they got them together  and they do it all on Facebook  and then they sell tickets  and the first band on the   I was going to say  menu   that's probably the wrong word for it  isn't it  The first band on the list of bands that appears at some public music performance of some kind gets the sales from the first    tickets  then the next band gets the next     and so on. They were at the bottom of the menu  they were like fifth  I thought they had no chance. He actually got    quid. Fantastic  right  But my point is  that all worked perfectly  except on the web. So they're sitting on Facebook  and they're sending these messages and arranging things and they don't know who anybody is  right  That's the big problem we're trying to solve. If only they were using the real names  Then you wouldn't be worried about them on the Internet. And so when he says to me   Oh  I want to go to a chatroom to talk about guitars  or something  I'm like   oh  well  I don't want you to go into a chatroom to talk about guitars  because they might not all be your friends  and some of the people that are in the chatroom might be perverts and teachers and vicars.  I mean  they generally are  when you look in the paper  right  So I want to know who all the people in the chatroom are. So okay  you can go in the chatroom  but only if everybody in the chatroom is using their real names  and they submit full copies of their police report. But of course  if anybody in the chatroom asked for his real name  I'd say no. You can't give them your real name. Because what happens if they turn out to be perverts  and teachers and whatever. So you have this odd sort of paradox where I'm happy for him to go into this space if I know who everybody else is  but I don't want anybody else to know who he is. And so you get this sort of logjam around identity where you want full disclosure from everybody else  but not from yourself. And there's no progress  we get stuck. And so the chatroom thing doesn't work properly  and it's a very bad way of thinking about identity. So on my RSS feed  I saw this thing about   I just said something bad about my RSS feed  didn't I  I should stop saying it like that. For some random reason  I can't imagine  something about cheerleaders turned up in my inbox. And I read this story about cheerleaders  and it's a fascinating story. This happened a couple of years ago in the U.S. There were some cheerleaders in a team at a high school in the U.S.  and they said mean things about their cheerleading coach  as I'm sure kids do about all of their teachers all of the time  and somehow the cheerleading coach found out about this. She was very upset. And so she went to one of the girls  and said   you have to give me your Facebook password.  I read this all the time  where even at some universities and places of education  kids are forced to hand over their Facebook passwords. So you've got to give them your Facebook password. She was a kid  What she should have said is   my lawyer will be calling you first thing in the morning. It's an outrageous imposition on my  th Amendment right to privacy  and you're going to be sued for all the money you've got.  That's what she should have said. But she's a kid  so she hands over the password. The teacher can't log into Facebook  because the school has blocked access to Facebook. So the teacher can't log into Facebook until she gets home. So the girl tells her friends  guess what happened  The teacher logged in  she knows. So the girls just all logged into Facebook on their phones  and deleted their profiles. And so when the teacher logged in  there was nothing there. My point is  those identities  they don't think about them the same way. Identity is  especially when you're a teenager  a fluid thing. You have lots of identities. And you can have an identity  you don't like it  because it's subverted in some way  or it's insecure  or it's inappropriate  you just delete it and get another one. The idea that you have an identity that's given to you by someone  the government or whatever  and you have to stick with that identity and use it in all places  that's absolutely wrong. Why would you want to really know who someone was on Facebook  unless you wanted to abuse them and harass them in some way  And it just doesn't work properly. And my fourth example is there are some cases where you really want to be   In case you're wondering  that's me at the G   protest. I wasn't actually at the G   protest  but I had a meeting at a bank on the day of the G   protest  and I got an email from the bank saying please don't wear a suit  because it'll inflame the protesters. I look pretty good in a suit  frankly  so you can see why it would drive them into an anti capitalist frenzy. So I thought  well  look. If I don't want to inflame the protesters  the obvious thing to do is go dressed as a protester. So I went dressed completely in black  you know  with a black balaclava  I had black gloves on  but I've taken them off to sign the visitor's book. I'm wearing black trousers  black boots  I'm dressed completely in black. I go into the bank at    o'clock  go   Hi  I'm Dave Birch  I've got a   o'clock with so and so there.  Sure. They sign me in. There's my visitor's badge. So this nonsense about you've got to have real names on Facebook and whatever  that gets you that kind of security. That gets you security theater  where there's no actual security  but people are sort of playing parts in a play about security. And as long as everybody learns their lines  everyone's happy. But it's not real security. Especially because I hate banks more than the G   protesters do  because I work for them. I know that things are actually worse than these guys think. But suppose I worked next to somebody in a bank who was doing something. Suppose I was sitting next to a rogue trader  and I want to report it to the boss of the bank. So I log on to do a little bit of whistleblowing. I send a message  this guy's a rogue trader. That message is meaningless if you don't know that I'm a trader at the bank. If that message just comes from anybody  it has zero information value. There's no point in sending that message. But if I have to prove who I am  I'll never send that message. It's just like the nurse in the hospital reporting the drunk surgeon. That message will only happen if I'm anonymous. So the system has to have ways of providing anonymity there  otherwise we don't get where we want to get to. So four issues. So what are we going to do about it  Well  what we tend to do about it is we think about Orwell space. And we try to make electronic versions of the identity card that we got rid of in     . So we think if we had a card  call it a Facebook login  which proves who you are  and I make you carry it all the time  that solves the problem. And of course  for all those reasons I've just outlined  it doesn't  and it might  actually  make some problems worse. The more times you're forced to use your real identity  certainly in transactional terms  the more likely that identity is to get stolen and subverted. The goal is to stop people from using identity in transactions which don't need identity  which is actually almost all transactions. Almost all of the transactions you do are not  who are you  They're  are you allowed to drive the car  are you allowed in the building  are you over     etcetera  etcetera. So my suggestion I  like James  think that there should be a resurgence of interest in R   D. I think this is a solvable problem. It's something we can do about. Naturally  in these circumstances  I turn to Doctor Who. Because in this  as in so many other walks of life  Doctor Who has already shown us the answer. So I should say  for some of our foreign visitors  Doctor Who is the greatest living scientist in England  and a beacon of truth and enlightenment to all of us. And this is Doctor Who with his psychic paper. Come on  you guys must have seen Doctor Who's psychic paper. You're not nerds if you say yes. Who's seen Doctor Who's psychic paper  Oh right  you were in the library the whole time studying I guess. Is that what you're going to tell us  Doctor Who's psychic paper is when you hold up the psychic paper  the person  in their brain  sees the thing that they need to see. So I want to show you a British passport  I hold up the psychic paper  you see a British passport. I want to get into a party  I hold up the psychic paper  I show you a party invitation. You see what you want to see. So what I'm saying is we need to make an electronic version of that  but with one tiny  tiny change  which is that it'll only show you the British passport if I've actually got one. It'll only show you the party invitation if I actually have one. It will only show you that I'm over    if I actually am over   . But nothing else. So you're the bouncer at the pub  you need to know that I'm over     instead of showing you my driving license  which shows you I know how to drive  what my name is  my address  all these kind of things  I show you my psychic paper  and all it tells you is am I over    or not. Right. Is that just a pipe dream  Of course not  otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to you. So in order to build that and make it work  I'm only going to name these things  I'll not go into them  we need a plan  which is we're going to build this as an infrastructure for everybody to use  to solve all of these problems. We're going to make a utility  the utility has to be universal  you can use it everywhere  I'm just giving you little flashes of the technology as we go along. That's a Japanese ATM  the fingerprint template is stored inside the mobile phone. So when you want to draw money out  you put the mobile phone on the ATM  and touch your finger  your fingerprint goes through to the phone  the phone says yes  that's whoever  and the ATM then gives you some money. It has to be a utility that you can use everywhere. It has to be absolutely convenient  that's me going into the pub. All the device on the door of the pub is allowed is  is this person over    and not barred from the pub  And so the idea is  you touch your ID card to the door  and if I am allowed in  it shows my picture  if I'm not allowed in  it shows a red cross. It doesn't disclose any other information. It has to have no special gadgets. That can only mean one thing  following on from Ross's statement  which I agree with completely. If it means no special gadgets  it has to run on a mobile phone. That's the only choice we have  we have to make it work on mobile phones. There are  .  billion mobile phone subscriptions. My favorite statistic of all time  only   billion toothbrushes in the world. That means something  I don't know what. I rely on our futurologists to tell me. It has to be a utility which is extensible. So it has to be something that anybody could build on. Anybody should be able to use this infrastructure  you don't need permissions  licenses  whatever  anyone should be able to write some code to do this. You know what symmetry is  so you don't need a picture of it. This is how we're going to do it. We're going to do it using phones  and we're going to do it using mobile proximity. I'm going to suggest to you the technology to implement Doctor Who's psychic paper is already here  and if any of you have got one of the new Barclay's debit cards with the contactless interface on it  you've already got that technology. If you've ever been up to the big city  and used an Oyster card at all  does that ring any bells to anybody  The technology already exists. The first phones that have the technology built in  the Google Nexus  the S   the Samsung Wifi  .   the first phones that have the technology built into them are already in the shops. So the idea that the gas man can turn up at my mom's door and he can show my mom his phone  and she can tap it with her phone  and it will come up with green if he really is from British Gas and allowed in  and it'll come up with red if he isn't  end of story. We have the technology to do that. And what's more  although some of those things sounded a bit counter intuitive  like proving I'm over    without proving who I am  the cryptography to do that not only exists  it's extremely well known and well understood. Digital signatures  the blinding of public key certificates  these technologies have been around for a while  we've just had no way of packaging them up. So the technology already exists. We know it works  There are a few examples of the technology being used in experimental places. That's London Fashion Week  where we built a system with O   that's for the Wireless Festival in Hyde Park  you can see the persons walking in with their VIP band  it's just being checked by the Nokia phone that's reading the band. I'm only putting those up to show you these things are prosaic  this stuff works in these environments. They don't need to be special. So finally  I know that you can do this  because if you saw the episode of Doctor Who  the Easter special of Doctor Who  where he went to Mars in a bus  I should say again for our foreign students  that doesn't happen every episode. This was a very special case. So in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus  I can't show you the clip  due to the outrageous restrictions of Queen Anne style copyright by the BBC  but in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus  Doctor Who is clearly shown getting on to the bus with the Oyster card reader using his psychic paper. Which proves that psychic paper has an MSE interface. Thank you very much. All right. So  like all good stories  this starts a long  long time ago when there was basically nothing. So here is a complete picture of the universe about    odd billion years ago. All energy is concentrated into a single point of energy. For some reason it explodes  and you begin to get these things. So you're now about    billion years into this. And these things expand and expand and expand into these giant galaxies  and you get trillions of them. And within these galaxies you get these enormous dust clouds. And I want you to pay particular attention to the three little prongs in the center of this picture. If you take a close up of those  they look like this. And what you're looking at is columns of dust where there's so much dust    by the way  the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles    and what's happening is there's so much dust  it comes together and it fuses and ignites a thermonuclear reaction. And so what you're watching is the birth of stars. These are stars being born out of here. When enough stars come out  they create a galaxy. This one happens to be a particularly important galaxy  because you are here. And as you take a close up of this galaxy  you find a relatively normal  not particularly interesting star. By the way  you're now about two thirds of the way into this story. So this star doesn't even appear until about two thirds of the way into this story. And then what happens is there's enough dust left over that it doesn't ignite into a star  it becomes a planet. And this is about a little over four billion years ago. And soon thereafter there's enough material left over that you get a primordial soup  and that creates life. And life starts to expand and expand and expand  until it goes kaput. Now the really strange thing is life goes kaput  not once  not twice  but five times. So almost all life on Earth is wiped out about five times. And as you're thinking about that  what happens is you get more and more complexity  more and more stuff to build new things with. And we don't appear until about   .   percent of the time into this story  just to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective. So within that context  there's two theories of the case as to why we're all here. The first theory of the case is that's all she wrote. Under that theory  we are the be all and end all of all creation. And the reason for trillions of galaxies  sextillions of planets  is to create something that looks like that and something that looks like that. And that's the purpose of the universe  and then it flat lines  it doesn't get any better. The only question you might want to ask yourself is  could that be just mildly arrogant  And if it is    and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction. There were only about       of our species left. A few more weeks without rain  we would have never seen any of these. So maybe you have to think about a second theory if the first one isn't good enough. Second theory is  Could we upgrade  Well  why would one ask a question like that  Because there have been at least    upgrades so far of humanoids. So it turns out that we have upgraded. We've upgraded time and again and again. And it turns out that we keep discovering upgrades. We found this one last year. We found another one last month. And as you're thinking about this  you might also ask the question  So why a single human species  Wouldn't it be really odd if you went to Africa and Asia and Antarctica and found exactly the same bird    particularly given that we co existed at the same time with at least eight other versions of humanoid at the same time on this planet  So the normal state of affairs is not to have just a Homo sapiens  the normal state of affairs is to have various versions of humans walking around. And if that is the normal state of affairs  then you might ask yourself  all right  so if we want to create something else  how big does a mutation have to be  Well Svante Paabo has the answer. The difference between humans and Neanderthal is  .    percent of gene code. That's how big the difference is one species to another. This explains most contemporary political debates. But as you're thinking about this  one of the interesting things is how small these mutations are and where they take place. Difference human Neanderthal is sperm and testis  smell and skin. And those are the specific genes that differ from one to the other. So very small changes can have a big impact. And as you're thinking about this  we're continuing to mutate. So about        years ago by the Black Sea  we had one mutation in one gene which led to blue eyes. And this is continuing and continuing and continuing. And as it continues  one of the things that's going to happen this year is we're going to discover the first        human genomes  because it's gotten cheap enough to do the gene sequencing. And when we find these  we may find differences. And by the way  this is not a debate that we're ready for  because we have really misused the science in this. In the     s  we thought there were major differences between people. That was partly based on Francis Galton's work. He was Darwin's cousin. But the U.S.  the Carnegie Institute  Stanford  American Neurological Association took this really far. That got exported and was really misused. In fact  it led to some absolutely horrendous treatment of human beings. So since the     s  we've been saying there are no differences  we're all identical. We're going to know at year end if that is true. And as we think about that  we're actually beginning to find things like  do you have an ACE gene  Why would that matter  Because nobody's ever climbed an       meter peak without oxygen that doesn't have an ACE gene. And if you want to get more specific  how about a    R genotype  Well it turns out that every male Olympic power athelete ever tested carries at least one of these variants. If that is true  it leads to some very complicated questions for the London Olympics. Three options  Do you want the Olympics to be a showcase for really hardworking mutants  Option number two  Why don't we play it like golf or sailing  Because you have one and you don't have one  I'll give you a tenth of a second head start. Version number three  Because this is a naturally occurring gene and you've got it and you didn't pick the right parents  you get the right to upgrade. Three different options. If these differences are the difference between an Olympic medal and a non Olympic medal. And it turns out that as we discover these things  we human beings really like to change how we look  how we act  what our bodies do. And we had about   .  million plastic surgeries in the United States  except that with the technologies that are coming online today  today's corrections  deletions  augmentations and enhancements are going to seem like child's play. You already saw the work by Tony Atala on TED  but this ability to start filling things like inkjet cartridges with cells are allowing us to print skin  organs and a whole series of other body parts. And as these technologies go forward  you keep seeing this  you keep seeing this  you keep seeing things          human genome sequence    and it seems like nothing's happening  until it does. And we may just be in some of these weeks. And as you're thinking about these two guys sequencing a human genome in      and the Public Project sequencing the human genome in       then you don't hear a lot  until you hear about an experiment last year in China  where they take skin cells from this mouse  put four chemicals on it  turn those skin cells into stem cells  let the stem cells grow and create a full copy of that mouse. That's a big deal. Because in essence what it means is you can take a cell  which is a pluripotent stem cell  which is like a skier at the top of a mountain  and those two skiers become two pluripotent stem cells  four  eight      and then it gets so crowded after    divisions that those cells have to differentiate. So they go down one side of the mountain  they go down another. And as they pick that  these become bone  and then they pick another road and these become platelets  and these become macrophages  and these become T cells. But it's really hard  once you ski down  to get back up. Unless  of course  if you have a ski lift. And what those four chemicals do is they take any cell and take it way back up the mountain so it can become any body part. And as you think of that  what it means is potentially you can rebuild a full copy of any organism out of any one of its cells. That turns out to be a big deal because now you can take  not just mouse cells  but you can human skin cells and turn them into human stem cells. And then what they did in October is they took skin cells  turned them into stem cells and began to turn them into liver cells. So in theory  you could grow any organ from any one of your cells. Here's a second experiment  If you could photocopy your body  maybe you also want to take your mind. And one of the things you saw at TED about a year and a half ago was this guy. And he gave a wonderful technical talk. He's a professor at MIT. But in essence what he said is you can take retroviruses  which get inside brain cells of mice. You can tag them with proteins that light up when you light them. And you can map the exact pathways when a mouse sees  feels  touches  remembers  loves. And then you can take a fiber optic cable and light up some of the same things. And by the way  as you do this  you can image it in two colors  which means you can download this information as binary code directly into a computer. So what's the bottom line on that  Well it's not completely inconceivable that someday you'll be able to download your own memories  maybe into a new body. And maybe you can upload other people's memories as well. And this might have just one or two small ethical  political  moral implications. Just a thought. Here's the kind of questions that are becoming interesting questions for philosophers  for governing people  for economists  for scientists. Because these technologies are moving really quickly. And as you think about it  let me close with an example of the brain. The first place where you would expect to see enormous evolutionary pressure today  both because of the inputs  which are becoming massive  and because of the plasticity of the organ  is the brain. Do we have any evidence that that is happening  Well let's take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand. Here's what it looks like in     . Here's what it looks like in                 . Here's the increase in less than a decade. And we still don't know why this is happening. What we do know is  potentially  the brain is reacting in a hyperactive  hyper plastic way  and creating individuals that are like this. And this is only one of the conditions that's out there. You've also got people with who are extraordinarily smart  people who can remember everything they've seen in their lives  people who've got synesthesia  people who've got schizophrenia. You've got all kinds of stuff going on out there  and we still don't understand how and why this is happening. But one question you might want to ask is  are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain and of how we process data  Because when you think of how much data's coming into our brains  we're trying to take in as much data in a day as people used to take in in a lifetime. And as you're thinking about this  there's four theories as to why this might be going on  plus a whole series of others. I don't have a good answer. There really needs to be more research on this. One option is the fast food fetish. There's beginning to be some evidence that obesity and diet have something to do with gene modifications  which may or may not have an impact on how the brain of an infant works. A second option is the sexy geek option. These conditions are highly rare. But what's beginning to happen is because these geeks are all getting together  because they are highly qualified for computer programming and it is highly remunerated  as well as other very detail oriented tasks  that they are concentrating geographically and finding like minded mates. So this is the assortative mating hypothesis of these genes reinforcing one another in these structures. The third  is this too much information  We're trying to process so much stuff that some people get synesthetic and just have huge pipes that remember everything. Other people get hyper sensitive to the amount of information. Other people react with various psychological conditions or reactions to this information. Or maybe it's chemicals. But when you see an increase of that order of magnitude in a condition  either you're not measuring it right or there's something going on very quickly  and it may be evolution in real time. Here's the bottom line. What I think we are doing is we're transitioning as a species. And I didn't think this when Steve Gullans and I started writing together. I think we're transitioning into Homo evolutis that  for better or worse  is not just a hominid that's conscious of his or her environment  it's a hominid that's beginning to directly and deliberately control the evolution of its own species  of bacteria  of plants  of animals. And I think that's such an order of magnitude change that your grandkids or your great grandkids may be a species very different from you. Thank you very much. When I go to parties  it doesn't usually take very long for people to find out that I'm a scientist and I study sex. And then I get asked questions. And the questions usually have a very particular format. They start with the phrase   A friend told me   and then they end with the phrase   Is this true   And most of the time I'm glad to say that I can answer them  but sometimes I have to say   I'm really sorry  but I don't know because I'm not that kind of a doctor.  That is  I'm not a clinician  I'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy. And my job is to look at lots of different species of animals and try to figure out how their tissues and organs work when everything's going right  rather than trying to figure out how to fix things when they go wrong  like so many of you. And what I do is I look for similarities and differences in the solutions that they've evolved for fundamental biological problems. So today I'm here to argue that this is not at all an esoteric Ivory Tower activity that we find at our universities  but that broad study across species  tissue types and organ systems can produce insights that have direct implications for human health. And this is true both of my recent project on sex differences in the brain  and my more mature work on the anatomy and function of penises. And now you know why I'm fun at parties. So today I'm going to give you an example drawn from my penis study to show you how knowledge drawn from studies of one organ system provided insights into a very different one. Now I'm sure as everyone in the audience already knows    I did have to explain it to my nine year old late last week    penises are structures that transfer sperm from one individual to another. And the slide behind me barely scratches the surface of how widespread they are in animals. There's an enormous amount of anatomical variation. You find muscular tubes  modified legs  modified fins  as well as the mammalian fleshy  inflatable cylinder that we're all familiar with    or at least half of you are. And I think we see this tremendous variation because it's a really effective solution to a very basic biological problem  and that is getting sperm in a position to meet up with eggs and form zygotes. Now the penis isn't actually required for internal fertiliztion  but when internal fertilization evolves  penises often follow. And the question I get when I start talking about this most often is   What made you interested in this subject   And the answer is skeletons. You wouldn't think that skeletons and penises have very much to do with one another. And that's because we tend to think of skeletons as stiff lever systems that produce speed or power. And my first forays into biological research  doing dinosaur paleontology as an undergraduate  were really squarely in that realm. But when I went to graduate school to study biomechanics  I really wanted to find a dissertation project that would expand our knowledge of skeletal function. I tried a bunch of different stuff. A lot of it didn't pan out. But then one day I started thinking about the mammalian penis. And it's really an odd sort of structure. Before it can be used for internal fertilization  its mechanical behavior has to change in a really dramatic fashion. Most of the time it's a flexible organ. It's easy to bend. But before it's brought into use during copulation it has to become rigid  it has to become difficult to bend. And moreover  it has to work. A reproductive system that fails to function produces an individual that has no offspring  and that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool. And so I thought   Here's a problem that just cries out for a skeletal system    not one like this one  but one like this one    because  functionally  a skeleton is any system that supports tissue and transmits forces. And I already knew that animals like this earthworm  indeed most animals  don't support their tissues by draping them over bones. Instead they're more like reinforced water balloons. They use a skeleton that we call a hydrostatic skeleton. And a hydrostatic skeleton uses two elements. The skeletal support comes from an interaction between a pressurized fluid and a surrounding wall of tissue that's held in tension and reinforced with fibrous proteins. And the interaction is crucial. Without both elements you have no support. If you have fluid with no wall to surround it and keep pressure up  you have a puddle. And if you have just the wall with no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension  you've got a little wet rag. When you look at a penis in cross section  it has a lot of the hallmarks of a hydrostatic skeleton. It has a central space of spongy erectile tissue that fills with fluid    in this case blood    surrounded by a wall of tissue that's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen. But at the time when I started this project  the best explanation I could find for penal erection was that the wall surrounded these spongy tissues  and the spongy tissues filled with blood and pressure rose and voila  it became erect. And that explained to me expansion    made sense  more fluid  you get tissues that expand    but it didn't actually explain erection. Because there was no mechanism in this explanation for making this structure hard to bend. And no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue. So I thought  wall tissue's important in skeletons. It has to be part of the explanation. And this was the point at which my graduate adviser said   Whoa  Hold on. Slow down.  Because after about six months of me talking about this  I think he finally figured out that I was really serious about the penis thing. So he sat me down  and he warned me. He was like   Be careful going down this path. I'm not sure this project's going to pan out.  Because he was afraid I was walking into a trap. I was taking on a socially embarrassing question with an answer that he thought might not be particularly interesting. And that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic elements. It had the central fluid  it had the surrounding wall  and the reinforcing fibers in the wall were arranged in crossed helices around the long axis of the skeleton. So the image behind me shows a piece of tissue in one of these cross helical skeletons cut so that you're looking at the surface of the wall. The arrow shows you the long axis. And you can see two layers of fibers  one in blue and one in yellow  arranged in left handed and right handed angles. And if you weren't just looking at a little section of the fibers  those fibers would be going in helices around the long axis of the skeleton    something like a Chinese finger trap  where you stick your fingers in and they get stuck. And these skeletons have a particular set of behaviors  which I'm going to demonstrate in a film. It's a model skeleton that I made out of a piece of cloth that I wrapped around an inflated balloon. The cloth's cut on the bias. So you can see that the fibers wrap in helices  and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves  which means the skeleton's flexible. It lengthens  shortens and bends really easily in response to internal or external forces. Now my adviser's concern was what if the penile wall tissue is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton. What are you going to contribute  What new thing are you contributing to our knowledge of biology  And I thought   Yeah  he does have a really good point here.  So I spent a long  long time thinking about it. And one thing kept bothering me  and that's  when they're functioning  penises don't wiggle. So something interesting had to be going on. So I went ahead  collected wall tissue  prepared it so it was erect  sectioned it  put it on slides and then stuck it under the microscope to have a look  fully expecting to see crossed helices of collagen of some variety. But instead I saw this. There's an outer layer and an inner layer. The arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton. I was really surprised at this. Everyone I showed it was really surprised at this. Why was everyone surprised at this  That's because we knew theoretically that there was another way of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton  and that was with fibers at zero degrees and    degrees to the long axis of the structure. The thing is  no one had ever seen it before in nature. And now I was looking at one. Those fibers in that particular orientation give the skeleton a very  very different behavior. I'm going to show a model made out of exactly the same materials. So it'll be made of the same cotton cloth  same balloon  same internal pressure. But the only difference is that the fibers are arranged differently. And you'll see that  unlike the cross helical model  this model resists extension and contraction and resists bending. Now what that tells us is that wall tissues are doing so much more than just covering the vascular tissues. They're an integral part of the penile skeleton. If the wall around the erectile tissue wasn't there  if it wasn't reinforced in this way  the shape would change  but the inflated penis would not resist bending  and erection simply wouldn't work. It's an observation with obvious medical applications in humans as well  but it's also relevant in a broad sense  I think  to the design of prosthetics  soft robots  basically anything where changes of shape and stiffness are important. So to sum up  Twenty years ago  I had a college adviser tell me  when I went to the college and said   I'm kind of interested in anatomy   they said   Anatomy's a dead science.  He couldn't have been more wrong. I really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies. Not just about its genetics and molecular biology  but up here in the meat end of the scale. We've got limits on our time. We often focus on one disease  one model  one problem  but my experience suggests that we should take the time to apply ideas broadly between systems and just see where it takes us. After all  if ideas about invertebrate skeletons can give us insights about mammalian reproductive systems  there could be lots of other wild and productive connections lurking out there just waiting to be found. Thank you. I have the answer to a question that we've all asked. The question is  Why is it that the letter X represents the unknown  Now I know we learned that in math class  but now it's everywhere in the culture    The X prize  the X Files  Project X  TEDx. Where'd that come from  About six years ago I decided that I would learn Arabic  which turns out to be a supremely logical language. To write a word or a phrase or a sentence in Arabic is like crafting an equation  because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information. That's one of the reasons so much of what we've come to think of as Western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks. This includes the little system in Arabic called al jebra. And al jebr roughly translates to  the system for reconciling disparate parts.  Al jebr finally came into English as algebra. One example among many. The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to Europe    which is to say Spain    in the   th and   th centuries. And when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a European language. But there were problems. One problem is there are some sounds in Arabic that just don't make it through a European voice box without lots of practice. Trust me on that one. Also  those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in European languages. Here's one of the culprits. This is the letter SHeen  and it makes the sound we think of as SH     sh.  It's also the very first letter of the word shalan  which means  something  just like the the English word  something     some undefined  unknown thing. Now in Arabic  we can make this definite by adding the definite article  al.  So this is al shalan    the unknown thing. And this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics  such as this   th century derivation of proofs. The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter SHeen and the word shalan can't be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn't have that SH  that  sh  sound. So by convention  they created a rule in which they borrowed the CK sound   ck  sound  from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai. Later when this material was translated into a common European language  which is to say Latin  they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X. And once that happened  once this material was in Latin  it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost     years. But now we have the answer to our question. Why is it that X is the unknown  X is the unknown because you can't say  sh  in Spanish. And I thought that was worth sharing. I collaborate with bacteria. And I'm about to show you some stop motion footage that I made recently where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment over the period of an hour. So what you're seeing here is the bacteria metabolizing  and as they do so they create an electrical charge. And this attracts metals from their local environment. And these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria. One of the most pervasive problems in the world today for people is inadequate access to clean drinking water. And the desalination process is one where we take out salts. We can use it for drinking and agriculture. Removing the salts from water    particularly seawater    through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe. So seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane filtration technology. We take the water from the sea and we apply pressure. And this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane. This takes energy  producing clean water. But we're also left with a concentrated salt solution  or brine. But the process is very expensive and it's cost prohibitive for many countries around the globe. And also  the brine that's produced is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea. And this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area that it's pumped back out into. So I work in Singapore at the moment  and this is a place that's really a leading place for desalination technology. And Singapore proposes by      to produce       million liters per day of desalinated water. But this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine. And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play. So what we're doing at the moment is we're accumulating metals like calcium  potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine. And this  in terms of magnesium and the amount of water that I just mentioned  equates to a   .  billion mining industry for Singapore    a place that doesn't have any natural resources. So I'd like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn't existed before  imagine a mining industry that doesn't mean defiling the Earth  imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine. And what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube  a mining industry that is in harmony with nature. Thank you. Today I'm going to unpack for you three examples of iconic design  and it makes perfect sense that I should be the one to do it because I have a Bachelor's degree in Literature. But I'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of Design Within Reach catalogs  so I pretty much know everything there is. Now  I'm sure you recognize this object  many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at Los Angeles International Airport over the past couple of days. This is known as the Theme Building  that is its name for reasons that are still very murky. And it is perhaps the best example we have in Los Angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture. It was first excavated in      as they were building LAX  although scientists believe that it dates back to the year      Before Common Era  when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants. It is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located  of course  at Stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design  the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously  the much better access to parking. When it was uncovered  it ushered in a new era of streamlined  archaically futuristic design called Googie  which came to be synonymous with the Jet Age  a misnomer. After all  the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often  preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls. Ah yes  a table. We use these every day. And on top of it  the juicy salif. This is a design by Philippe Starck  who I believe is in the audience at this very moment. And you can tell it is a Starck design by its precision  its playfulness  its innovation and its promise of imminent violence. It is a design that challenges your intuition    it is not what you think it is when you first see it. It is not a fork designed to grab three hors d'oeuvres at a time  which would be useful out in the lobby  I would say. And despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey ness and tripodism  it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts. It is in fact a citrus juicer and when I say that  you never see it as anything else again. It is also not a monument to design  it is a monument to design's utility. You can take it home with you  unlike the Theme Building  which will stay where it is forever. This is affordable and can come home with you and  as such  it can sit on your kitchen counter    it can't go in your drawers  trust me  I found that out the hard way    and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design. One other thing about it  if you do have one at home  let me tell you one of the features you may not know  when you fall asleep  it comes alive and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep. Okay  what is this object  I have no idea. I don't know what that thing is. It looks terrible. Is it a little hot plate  I don't get it. Does anyone know  Chi  It's an ... iPhone. iPhone. Oh yes  that's right  I remember those  I had my whole bathroom tiles redone with those back in the good old days. No  I have an iPhone. Of course I do. Here is my well loved iPhone. I do so many things on this little device. I like to read books on it. More than that  I like to buy books on it that I never have to feel guilty about not reading because they go in here and I never look at them again and it's perfect. I use it every day to measure the weight of an ox  for example. Every now and then  I admit that I complete a phone call on it occasionally. And yet I forget about it all the time. This is a design that once you saw it  you forgot about it. It is easy to forget the gasp inducement that occurred in      when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life. Unlike the Theme Building  this is not alien technology. Or I should say  what it did was it took technology which  unlike people in this room  to many other people in the world  still feels very alien  and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate. And unlike the juicy salif  it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain  rather  it simply attaches itself to your brain. And you didn't even notice it happened. So there you go. My name is John Hodgman. I just explained design. Thank you very much. I always wanted to become a walking laboratory of social engagement  to resonate other people's feelings  thoughts  intentions  motivations  in the act of being with them. As a scientist  I always wanted to measure that resonance  that sense of the other that happens so quickly  in the blink of an eye. We intuit other people's feelings. We know the meaning of their actions even before they happen. We're always in this stance of being the object of somebody else's subjectivity. We do that all the time. We just can't shake it off. It's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves  to understand the world around them  is shaped by that stance. We are social to the core. So my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism. Most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long stay hospitals. This is a long time ago. And for them  autism was devastating. They had profound intellectual disabilities. They didn't talk. But most of all  they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them  from their environment and from the people. In fact  at the time  if you walked into a school for individuals with autism  you'd hear a lot of noise  plenty of commotion  actions  people doing things  but they're always doing things by themselves. So they may be looking at a light in the ceiling  or they may be isolated in the corner  or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements  in self stimulatory movements that led them nowhere. Extremely  extremely isolated. Well  now we know that autism is this disruption  the disruption of this resonance that I am telling you. These are survival skills. These are survival skills that we inherited over many  many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution. You see  babies are born in a state of utter fragility. Without the caregiver  they wouldn't survive  so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with these mechanisms of survival. They orient to the caregiver. From the first days and weeks of life  babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment. They prefer to look at people rather than at things  and even as they're looking at people  they look at people's eyes  because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences  so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away. Well  they orient to the caregiver. The caregiver seeks the baby. And it's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind  the social mind  the social brain  depends on. We always think about autism as something that happens later on in life. It doesn't. It begins with the beginning of life. As babies engage with caregivers  they soon realize that  well  there is something in between the ears that is very important    it's invisible  you can't see    but is really critical  and that thing is called attention. And they learn soon enough  even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want. They also learn to follow other people's gaze  because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about. And soon enough  they start to learn about the meaning of things  because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something  they're not just getting a directional cue  they are getting the other person's meaning of that thing  the attitude  and soon enough they start building this body of meanings  but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction. Those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others. Well  this is a little    month old little girl  and she has autism. And I am coming so close to her that I am maybe two inches from her face  and she's quite oblivious to me. Imagine if I did that to you  and I came two inches from your face. You'd do probably two things  wouldn't you  You would recoil. You would call the police.  Laughter  You would do something  because it's literally impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get a reaction. We do so  remember  intuitively  effortlessly. This is our body wisdom. It's not something that is mediated by our language. Our body just knows that  and we've known that for a long time. And this is not something that happens to humans only. It happens to some of our phylatic cousins  because if you're a monkey  and you look at another monkey  and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you  and that is considered to be a signal or threat  well  you are not going to be alive for long. So something that in other species are survival mechanisms  without them they wouldn't basically live  we bring into the context of human beings  and this is what we need to simply act  act socially. Now  she is oblivious to me  and I am so close to her  and you think  maybe she can see you  maybe she can hear you. Well  a few minutes later  she goes to the corner of the room  and she finds a tiny little piece of candy  an M M. So I could not attract her attention  but something  a thing  did. Now  most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people. Now  for this girl  that division line is not so clear  and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like. Now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences. Now  what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further. So we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic  the brain determines who we are going to be. But in fact the brain also becomes who we are  and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction  this is what's happening with her mind and this is what's happening with her brain. Well  autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders  and it's a brain disorder. It's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born. We now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism. There are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled  but there are those that are gifted. There are those individuals who don't talk at all. There are those individuals who talk too much. There are those individuals that if you observe them in their school  you see them running the periphery fence of the school all day if you let them  to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly  relentlessly  but often in an awkward fashion  without that immediate resonance. Well  this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time. When I started in this field  we thought that there were four individuals with autism per         a very rare condition. Well  now we know it's more like one in    . There are millions of individuals with autism all around us. The societal cost of this condition is huge. In the U.S. alone  maybe    to    billion dollars  and you know what  Most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled  individuals who need wrap around services  services that are very  very intensive  and those services can cost in excess of    to        dollars a year. Those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment  because now we know that autism creates itself as they diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you. Were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point  and intervene and treat  I can tell you  and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past    years  this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition. Also  we have a window of opportunity  because the brain is malleable for just so long  and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life. It's not that that window closes. It doesn't. But it diminishes considerably. And yet  the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years  and in disadvantaged populations  the populations that don't have access to clinical services  rural populations  minorities  the age of diagnosis is later still  which is almost as if I were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe. So I feel that we have a bio ethical imperative. The science is there  but no science is of relevance if it doesn't have an impact on the community  and we just can't afford that missed opportunity  because children with autism become adults with autism  and we feel that those things that we can do for these children  for those families  early on  will have lifetime consequences  for the child  for the family  and for the community at large. So this is our view of autism. There are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism. In fact  we believe that there are going to be something between     and     genes associated with autism  and genetic anomalies  much more than just genes. And we actually have a bit of a question here  because if there are so many different causes of autism  how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome  Because people like myself  when we walk into a playroom  we recognize a child as having autism. So how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity  And the answer is  what lies in between  which is development. And in fact  we are very interested in those first two years of life  because those liabilities don't necessarily convert into autism. Autism creates itself. Were we to be able to intervene during those years of life  we might attenuate for some  and God knows  maybe even prevent for others. So how do we do that  How do we enter that feeling of resonance  how do we enter another person's being  I remember when I interacted with that    month older  that the thing that came to mind was   How do you come into her world  Is she thinking about me  Is she thinking about others   Well  it's hard to do that  so we had to create the technologies. We had to basically step inside a body. We had to see the world through her eyes. And so in the past many years we've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking. We can see moment by moment what children are engaging with. Well  this is my colleague Warren Jones  with whom we've been building these methods  these studies  for the past    years  and you see there a happy five month older  it's a five month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world  his mom  the caregiver  but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare. What we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory  but in order for us to do that  we had to create these very sophisticated measures  measures of how people  how little babies  how newborns  engage with the world  moment by moment  what is important  and what is not. Well  we created those measures  and here  what you see is what we call a funnel of attention. You're watching a video. Those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of    typically developing two year olds  and we freeze one frame  and this is what the typical children are doing. In this scan pass  in green here  are two year olds with autism. So on that frame  the children who are typical are watching this  the emotion of expression of that little boy as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl. What are the children with autism doing  They are focusing on the revolving door  opening and shutting. Well  I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen only in our five minute experiment. It happens moment by moment in their real lives  and their minds are being formed  and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers. Well  we took a construct from our pediatrician friends  the concept of growth charts. You know  when you take a child to the pediatrician  and so you have physical height  and weight. Well we decided that we're going to create growth charts of social engagement  and we sought children from the time that they are born  and what you see here on the x axis is two  three  four  five  six months and nine  until about the age of    months  and this is the percent of their viewing time that they are focusing on people's eyes  and this is their growth chart. They start over here  they love people's eyes  and it remains quite stable. It sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months. Now  let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic. It's something very different. It starts way up here  but then it's a free fall. It's very much like they brought into this world the reflex that orients them to people  but it has no traction. It's almost as if that stimulus  you  you're not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives. Now  we thought that those data were so powerful in a way  that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life  because if you interact with a two  and a three month older  you'd be surprised by how social those babies are. And what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily. And using these kinds of measures  and many others  what we found out is that our science could  in fact  identify this condition early on. We didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge in the second year of life. If we measured things that are  evolutionarily  highly conserved  and developmentally very early emerging  things that are online from the first weeks of life  we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months  and that's what we are doing now. Now  we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children  but this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community. Now we want those devices  of course  to be deployed by those who are in the trenches  our colleagues  the primary care physicians  who see every child  and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice  because they have to see so many children. And we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child  but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention  for treatment. We need to be able to work with the families  to support the families  to manage those first years with them. We need to be able to really go from universal screening to universal access to treatment  because those treatments are going to change these children's and those families' lives. Now  when we think about what we  can  do in those first years  I can tell you  having been in this field for so long  one feels really rejuvenated. There is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities  preventing  in fact  those experiences that I really started in my journey in this field. I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition. No longer. We can do a great deal of things. And the idea is not to cure autism. That's not the idea. What we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times  the profound intellectual disabilities  the lack of language  the profound  profound isolation. We feel that individuals with autism  in fact  have a very special perspective on the world  and we need diversity  and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength  predictable situations  situations that can be defined. Because after all  they learn about the world almost like about it  rather than learning how to function in it. But this is a strength  if you're working  for example  in technology. And there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities. We want them to be free of that. We want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise. Well thank you for listening to me.  Applause  I am no designer  nope  no way. My dad was  which is kind of an interesting way to grow up. I had to figure out what it is my dad did and why it was important. Dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up  you know   Bad design is just people not thinking  John   he would say whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower or  say  a typewriter ribbon would get tangled or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen. You know   Design    bad design  there's just no excuse for it. It's letting stuff happen without thinking about it. Every object should be about something  John. It should imagine a user. It should cast that user in a story starring the user and the object. Good design   my dad said   is about supplying intent.  That's what he said. Dad helped design the control panels for the IBM     computer. That was a big deal  that was important. He worked for Kodak for a while  that was important. He designed chairs and desks and other office equipment for Steelcase  that was important. I knew design was important in my house because  for heaven's sake  it put food on our table  right  And design was in everything my dad did. He had a Dixieland jazz band when we were growing up  and he would always cover Louis Armstrong tunes. And I would ask him every once in a while   Dad  do you want it to sound like the record   We had lots of old jazz records lying around the house. And he said   No  never  John  never. The song is just a given  that's how you have to think about it. You gotta make it your own. You gotta design it. Show everyone what you intend   is what he said.  Doing that  acting by design  is what we all should be doing. It's where we all belong.  All of us  Designers  Oh  oh  Dad. Oh  Dad. The song is just a given. It's how you cover it that matters. Well  let's hold on to that thought for just a minute. It's kind of like this wheelchair I'm in  right  The original tune  It's a little scary.  Ooh  what happened to that dude  He can't walk. Anybody know the story  Anybody   I don't like to talk about this very much  but I'll tell you guys the story today. All right  exactly    years ago this week  that's right  I was in a poorly designed automobile that hit a poorly designed guardrail on a poorly designed road in Pennsylvania  and plummeted down a     foot embankment and killed two people in the car. But ever since then  the wheelchair has been a given in my life. My life  at the mercy of good design and bad design. Think about it. Now  in design terms  a wheelchair is a very difficult object. It mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune  and it projects that message  that story  so strongly that it almost blots out anything else. I roll swiftly through an airport  right  And moms grab their kids out of the way and say   Don't stare   The poor kid  you know  has this terrified look on his face  God knows what they think. And for decades  I'm going  why does this happen  What can I do about it  How can I change this  I mean there must be something. So I would roll  I'd make no eye contact    just kinda frown  right  Or I'd dress up really  really sharply or something. Or I'd make eye contact with everyone    that was really creepy  that didn't work at all. You know anything  I'd try. I wouldn't shower for a week    nothing worked. Nothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago  my six year old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that I had  and they said   Oh  Dad  Dad  Look  you gotta get these  these flashy wheels    you gotta get 'em   And I said   Oh  girls  Dad is a very important journalist  that just wouldn't do at all.  And of course  they immediately concluded   Oh  what a bummer  Dad. Journalists aren't allowed to have flashy wheels. I mean  how important could you be then   they said. I went   Wait a minute  all right  right    I'll get the wheels.  Purely out of protest  I got the flashy wheels  and I installed them and    check this out. Could I have my special light cue please  Look at that  Now ... look at  look at this  Look at this  So what you are looking at here has completely changed my life  I mean totally changed my life. Instead of blank stares and awkwardness  now it is pointing and smiling  People going   Awesome wheels  dude  Those are awesome  I mean  I want some of those wheels   Little kids say   Can I have a ride   And of course there's the occasional person    usually a middle aged male who will say   Oh  those wheels are great  I guess they're for safety  right   No  They're not for safety. No  no  no  no  no. What's the difference here  the wheelchair with no lights and the wheelchair with lights  The difference is intent. That's right  that's right  I'm no longer a victim. I chose to change the situation    I'm the Commander of the Starship Wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the front. Right  Intent changes the picture completely. I choose to enhance this rolling experience with a simple design element. Acting with intent. It conveys authorship. It suggests that someone is driving. It's reassuring  people are drawn to it. Someone making the experience their own. Covering the tragic tune with something different  something radically different. People respond to that. Now it seems simple  but actually I think in our society and culture in general  we have a huge problem with intent. Now go with me here. Look at this guy. You know who this is  It's Anders Breivik. Now  if he intended to kill in Olso  Norway last year  dozens and dozens of young people    if he intended to do that  he's a vicious criminal. We punish him. Life in prison. Death penalty in the United States  not so much in Norway. But  if he instead acted out of a delusional fantasy  if he was motivated by some random mental illness  he's in a completely different category. We may put him away for life  but we watch him clinically. It's a completely different domain. As an intentional murderer  Anders Breivik is merely evil. But as a dysfunctional  as a dysfunctional murderer psychotic  he's something much more complicated. He's the breath of some primitive  ancient chaos. He's the random state of nature we emerged from. He's something very  very different. It's as though intent is an essential component for humanity. It's what we're supposed to do somehow. We're supposed to act with intent. We're supposed to do things by design. Intent is a marker for civilization. Now here's an example a little closer to home  My family is all about intent. You can probably tell there are two sets of twins  the result of IVF technology  in vitro fertilization technology  due to some physical limitations I won't go into. Anyway  in vitro technology  IVF  is about as intentional as agriculture. Let me tell you  some of you may have the experience. In fact  the whole technology of sperm extraction for spinal cord injured males was invented by a veterinarian. I met the dude. He's a great guy. He carried this big leather bag full of sperm probes for all of the animals that he'd worked with  all the different animals. Probes he designed  and in fact  he was really  really proud of these probes. He would say   You're right between horse and squirrel  John.  But anyway  so when my wife and I decided to upgrade our early middle age    we had four kids  after all    with a little different technology that I won't explain in too much detail here    my urologist assured me I had nothing whatsoever to worry about.  No need for birth control  Doc  are you sure about that    John  John  I looked at your chart. From your sperm tests we can confidently say that you're basically a form of birth control.  Well  What a liberating thought  Yes  And after a couple very liberating weekends  my wife and I  utilizing some cutting edge erectile technology that is certainly worthy of a TEDTalk someday but I won't get into it now  we noticed some familiar  if unexpected  symptoms. I wasn't exactly a form of birth control. Look at that font there. My wife was so pissed. I mean  did a designer come up with that  No  I don't think a designer did come up with that. In fact  maybe that's the problem. And so  little Ajax was born. He's like our other children  but the experience is completely different. It's something like my accident  right  He came out of nowhere. But we all had to change  but not just react to the given  we bend to this new experience with intent. We're five now. Five. Facing the given with intent. Doing things by design. Hey  the name Ajax    you can't get much more intentional than that  right  We're really hoping he thanks us for that later on. But I never became a designer. No  no  no  no. Never attempted. Never even close. I did love some great designs as I was growing up  The HP   S calculator    God  I loved that thing. Oh God  I wish I had one. Man  I love that thing. I could afford that. Other designs I really couldn't afford  like the          Targa. In school  I studied nothing close to design or engineering  I studied useless things like the Classics  but there were some lessons even there    this guy  Plato  it turns out he's a designer. He designed a state in  The Republic   a design never implemented. Listen to one of the design features of Plato's Government  .    The State in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed  and the State in which they are most eager  the worst.  Well  got that wrong  didn't we  But look at that statement  it's all about intent. That's what I love about it. But consider what Plato is doing here. What is he doing  It's a grand idea of design    a huge idea of design  common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy that emerged in the Classical period. What was going on then  They were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive  As the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos  a confrontation with random  brutal nature  they suddenly had a moment to think    and there was a lot to think about. All of a sudden  human existence needed an intent. Human life needed a reason. Reality itself needed a designer. The given was replaced by various aspects of intent  by various designs  by various gods. Gods we're still fighting about. Oh yeah. Today we don't confront the chaos of nature. Today it is the chaos of humanity's impact on the Earth itself that we confront. This young discipline called design  I think  is in fact the emerging ethos formulating and then answering a very new question  What shall we do now in the face of the chaos that we have created  What shall we do  How shall we inscribe intent on all the objects we create  on all the circumstances we create  on all the places we change  The consequences of a planet with   billion people and counting. That's the tune we're all covering today  all of us. And we can't just imitate the past. No. That won't do. That won't do at all. Here's my favorite design moment  In the city of Kinshasa in Zaire in the     s  I was working for ABC News  and I was reporting on the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko  the dictator  the brutal dictator in Zaire  who raped and pillaged that country. There was rioting in the middle of Kinshasa. The place was falling apart  it was a horrible  horrible place  and I needed to go and explore the center of Kinshasa to report on the rioting and the looting. People were carrying off vehicles  carrying off pieces of buildings. Soldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests. In the middle of this chaos  I'm rolling around in a wheelchair  and I was completely invisible. Completely. I was in a wheelchair  I didn't look like a looter. I was in a wheelchair  I didn't look like a journalist  particularly  at least from their perspective. And I didn't look like a soldier  that's for sure. I was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of Zaire  completely invisible. And all of a sudden  from around a corner  comes this young man  paralyzed  just like me  in this metal and wood and leather pedal  three wheel tricycle wheelchair device  and he pedals up to me as fast as he can. He goes   Hey  mister  Mister   And I looked at him    he didn't know any other English than that  but we didn't need English  no  no  no  no  no. We sat there and compared wheels and tires and spokes and tubes. And I looked at his whacky pedal mechanism  he was full of pride over his design. I wish I could show you that contraption. His smile  our glow as we talked a universal language of design  invisible to the chaos around us. His machine  homemade  bolted  rusty  comical. My machine  American made  confident  sleek. He was particularly proud of the comfortable seat  really comfortable seat he had made in his chariot and its beautiful fabric fringe around the edge. Oh  I wish I'd had those sparkly wheels back then to have shown him  man  He would have loved those  Oh yeah. He would have understood those  a chariot of pure intent    think about it    in a city out of control. Design blew it all away for a moment. We spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos. He went back to the streets of Kinshasa  I went to my hotel. And I think of him now  now ... And I pose this question. An object imbued with intent    it has power  it's treasure  we're drawn to it. An object devoid of intent    it's random  it's imitative  it repels us. It's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away. This is what we must demand of our lives  of our objects  of our things  of our circumstances  living with intent. And I have to say that on that score  I have a very unfair advantage over all of you. And I want to explain it to you now because this is a very special day. Thirty six years ago at nearly this moment  a    year old boy awoke from a coma to ask a nurse a question  but the nurse was already there with an answer.  You've had a terrible accident  young man. You've broken your back. You'll never walk again.  I said   I know all that    what day is it   You see  I knew that the car had gone over the guardrail on the   th of February  and I knew that      was a leap year.  Nurse  Is this the   th or the   th   And she looked at me and said   It's March  st.  And I went   Oh my God. I've got some catching up to do   And from that moment  I knew the given was that accident  I had no option but to make up this new life without walking. Intent    a life with intent    lived by design  covering the original with something better. It's something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times. To get back to this  to get back to design  and as my daddy suggested a long time ago   Make the song your own  John. Show everybody what you intend.  Daddy  this one's for you.   Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner     but he was another man.     Jo Jo left his home in Tucson  Arizona to attend a California bash.     Get back  get back      get back to where you once belonged.     Get back  get back      get back to where you once belonged.   So my freshman year of college I signed up for an internship in the housing unit at Greater Boston Legal Services. Showed up the first day ready to make coffee and photocopies  but was paired with this righteous  deeply inspired attorney named Jeff Purcell  who thrust me onto the front lines from the very first day. And over the course of nine months I had the chance to have dozens of conversations with low income families in Boston who would come in presenting with housing issues  but always had an underlying health issue. So I had a client who came in  about to be evicted because he hasn't paid his rent. But he hasn't paid his rent  of course  because he's paying for his HIV medication and just can't afford both. We had moms who would come in  daughter has asthma  wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning. And one of our litigation strategies was actually to send me into the home of these clients with these large glass bottles. And I would collect the cockroaches  hot glue gun them to this poster board that we'd bring to court for our cases. And we always won because the judges were just so grossed out. Far more effective  I have to say  than anything I later learned in law school. But over the course of these nine months  I grew frustrated with feeling like we were intervening too far downstream in the lives of our clients    that by the time they came to us  they were already in crisis. And at the end of my freshman year of college  I read an article about the work that Dr. Barry Zuckerman was doing as Chair of Pediatrics at Boston Medical Center. And his first hire was a legal services attorney to represent the patients. So I called Barry  and with his blessing  in October      walked into the waiting room of the pediatrics clinic at Boston Medical Center. I'll never forget  the TVs played this endless reel of cartoons. And the exhaustion of mothers who had taken two  three  sometimes four buses to bring their child to the doctor was just palpable. The doctors  it seemed  never really had enough time for all the patients  try as they might. And over the course of six months  I would corner them in the hallway and ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question   If you had unlimited resources  what's the one thing you would give your patients   And I heard the same story again and again  a story we've heard hundreds of times since then. They said   Every day we have patients that come into the clinic    child has an ear infection  I prescribe antibiotics. But the real issue is there's no food at home. The real issue is that child is living with    other people in a two bedroom apartment. And I don't even ask about those issues because there's nothing I can do. I have    minutes with each patient. Patients are piling up in the clinic waiting room. I have no idea where the nearest food pantry is. And I don't even have any help.  In that clinic  even today  there are two social workers for        pediatric patients  which is better than a lot of the clinics out there. So Health Leads was born of these conversations    a simple model where doctors and nurses can prescribe nutritious food  heat in the winter and other basic resources for their patients the same way they prescribe medication. Patients then take their prescriptions to our desk in the clinic waiting room where we have a core of well trained college student advocates who work side by side with these families to connect them out to the existing landscape of community resources. So we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room    totally lemonade stand style. But today we have a thousand college student advocates who are working to connect nearly       patients and their families with the resources that they need to be healthy. So    months ago I got this email that changed my life. And the email was from Dr. Jack Geiger  who had written to congratulate me on Health Leads and to share  as he said  a bit of historical context. In      Dr. Geiger founded one of the first two community health centers in this country  in a brutally poor area in the Mississippi Delta. And so many of his patients came in presenting with malnutrition that be began prescribing food for them. And they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket  which would fill them and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic. And when the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington  D.C.    which was funding Geiger's clinic    found out about this  they were furious. And they sent this bureaucrat down to tell Geiger that he was expected to use their dollars for medical care    to which Geiger famously and logically responded   The last time I checked my textbooks  the specific therapy for malnutrition was food.  So when I got this email from Dr. Geiger  I knew I was supposed to be proud to be part of this history. But the truth is I was devastated. Here we are     years after Geiger has prescribed food for his patients  and I have doctors telling me   On those issues  we practice a 'don't ask  don't tell' policy.  Forty five years after Geiger  Health Leads has to reinvent the prescription for basic resources. So I have spent hours upon hours trying to make sense of this weird Groundhog Day. How is it that if for decades we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients  and especially low income patients  healthy  that we didn't use it  If we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a sick care system  why don't we just do it  These questions  in my mind  are not hard because the answers are complicated  they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves. My belief is that it's almost too painful to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system  or even admit that we have any at all. Because if we did  they would be so removed from our current reality. But that doesn't change my belief that all of us  deep inside  here in this room and across this country  share a similar set of desires. That if we are honest with ourselves and listen quietly  that we all harbor one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare  that it keep us healthy. This aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy is an enormously powerful one. And the way I think about this is that healthcare is like any other system. It's just a set of choices that people make. What if we decided to make a different set of choices  What if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare that have drifted away from us and stand firm and say   No. These things are ours. They will be used for our purposes. They will be used to realize our aspiration   What if everything we needed to realize our aspiration for healthcare was right there in front of us just waiting to be claimed  So that's where Health Leads began. We started with the prescription pad    a very ordinary piece of paper    and we asked  not what do patients need to get healthy    antibiotics  an inhaler  medication    but what do patients need to be healthy  to not get sick in the first place  And we chose to use the prescription for that purpose. So just a few miles from here at Children's National Medical Center  when patients come into the doctor's office  they're asked a few questions. They're asked   Are you running out of food at the end of the month  Do you have safe housing   And when the doctor begins the visit  she knows height  weight  is there food at home  is the family living in a shelter. And that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices  but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient  using Health Leads like any other sub specialty referral. The problem is  once you get a taste of what it's like to realize your aspiration for healthcare  you want more. So we thought  if we can get individual doctors to prescribe these basic resources for their patients  could we get an entire healthcare system to shift its presumption  And we gave it a shot. So now at Harlem Hospital Center when patients come in with an elevated body mass index  the electronic medical record automatically generates a prescription for Health Leads. And our volunteers can then work with them to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs in their communities. We've created a presumption that if you're a patient at that hospital with an elevated BMI  the four walls of the doctor's office probably aren't going to give you everything you need to be healthy. You need more. So on the one hand  this is just a basic recoding of the electronic medical record. And on the other hand  it's a radical transformation of the electronic medical record from a static repository of diagnostic information to a health promotion tool. In the private sector  when you squeeze that kind of additional value out of a fixed cost investment  it's called a billion dollar company. But in my world  it's called reduced obesity and diabetes. It's called healthcare    a system where doctors can prescribe solutions to improve health  not just manage disease. Same thing in the clinic waiting room. So every day in this country three million patients pass through about         clinic waiting rooms in this country. And what do they do when they're there  They sit  they watch the goldfish in the fish tank  they read extremely old copies of Good Housekeeping magazine. But mostly we all just sit there forever  waiting. How did we get here where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours to waiting  What if we had a waiting room where you don't just sit when you're sick  but where you go to get healthy. If airports can become shopping malls and McDonald's can become playgrounds  surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room. And that's what Health Leads has tried to do  to reclaim that real estate and that time and to use it as a gateway to connect patients to the resources they need to be healthy. So it's a brutal winter in the Northeast  your kid has asthma  your heat just got turned off  and of course you're in the waiting room of the ER  because the cold air triggered your child's asthma. But what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously  the waiting room became the place where Health Leads turned your heat back on  And of course all of this requires a broader workforce. But if we're creative  we already have that too. We know that our doctors and nurses and even social workers aren't enough  that the ticking minutes of health care are too constraining. Health just takes more time. It requires a non clinical army of community health workers and case managers and many others. What if a small part of that next healthcare workforce were the    million college students in this country  Unencumbered by clinical responsibilities  unwilling to take no for an answer from those bureaucracies that tend to crush patients  and with an unparalleled ability for information retrieval honed through years of using Google. Now lest you think it improbable that a college volunteer can make this kind of commitment  I have two words for you  March Madness. The average NCAA Division I men's basketball player dedicates    hours a week to his sport. Now we may think that's good or bad  but in either case it's real. And Health Leads is based on the presumption that for too long we have asked too little of our college students when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities. College sports teams say   We're going to take dozens of hours at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning and we're going to measure your performance  and your team's performance  and if you don't measure up or you don't show up  we're going to cut you off the team. But we'll make huge investments in your training and development  and we'll give you an extraordinary community of peers.  And people line up out the door just for the chance to be part of it. So our feeling is  if it's good enough for the rugby team  it's good enough for health and poverty. Health Leads too recruits competitively  trains intensively  coaches professionally  demands significant time  builds a cohesive team and measures results    a kind of Teach for America for healthcare. Now in the top    cities in the U.S. with the largest number of Medicaid patients  each of those has at least        college students. New York alone has half a million college students. And this isn't just a sort of short term workforce to connect patients to basic resources  it's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline who've spent two  three  four years in the clinic waiting room talking to patients about their most basic health needs. And they leave with the conviction  the ability and the efficacy to realize our most basic aspirations for health care. And the thing is  there's thousands of these folks already out there. So Mia Lozada is Chief Resident of Internal Medicine at UCSF Medical Center  but for three years as an undergraduate she was a Health Leads volunteer in the clinic waiting room at Boston Medical Center. Mia says   When my classmates write a prescription  they think their work is done. When I write a prescription  I think  can the family read the prescription  Do they have transportation to the pharmacy  Do they have food to take with the prescription  Do they have insurance to fill the prescription  Those are the questions I learned at Health Leads  not in medical school.  Now none of these solutions    the prescription pad  the electronic medical record  the waiting room  the army of college students    are perfect. But they are ours for the taking    simple examples of the vast under utilized healthcare resources that  if we reclaimed and redeployed  could realize our most basic aspiration of healthcare. So I had been at Legal Services for about nine months when this idea of Health Leads started percolating in my mind. And I knew I had to tell Jeff Purcell  my attorney  that I needed to leave. And I was so nervous  because I thought he was going to be disappointed in me for abandoning our clients for some crazy idea. And I sat down with him and I said   Jeff  I have this idea that we could mobilize college students to address patients' most basic health needs.  And I'll be honest  all I wanted was for him to not be angry at me. But he said this   Rebecca  when you have a vision  you have an obligation to realize that vision. You must pursue that vision.  And I have to say  I was like  Whoa. That's a lot of pressure.  I just wanted a blessing  I didn't want some kind of mandate. But the truth is I've spent every waking minute nearly since then chasing that vision. I believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country. I believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare  it will not be by the diseases cured  but by the diseases prevented. It will not be by the excellence of our technologies or the sophistication of our specialists  but by how rarely we needed them. And most of all  I believe that when we measure healthcare  it will be  not by what the system was  but by what we chose it to be. Thank you. Thank you. Evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures create their identity in some kind of narrative form. From mother to daughter  preacher to congregant  teacher to pupil  storyteller to audience. Whether in cave paintings or the latest uses of the Internet  human beings have always told their histories and truths through parable and fable. We are inveterate storytellers. But where  in our increasingly secular and fragmented world  do we offer communality of experience  unmediated by our own furious consumerism  And what narrative  what history  what identity  what moral code are we imparting to our young  Cinema is arguably the   th century's most influential art form. Its artists told stories across national boundaries  in as many languages  genres and philosophies as one can imagine. Indeed  it is hard to find a subject that film has yet to tackle. During the last decade we've seen a vast integration of global media  now dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster. We are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation  not story  is king. What was common to us all    years ago    the telling of stories between generations    is now rarified. As a filmmaker  it worried me. As a human being  it puts the fear of God in me. What future could the young build with so little grasp of where they've come from and so few narratives of what's possible  The irony is palpable  technical access has never been greater  cultural access never weaker. And so in      we set up FILMCLUB  an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools followed by discussions. If we could raid the annals of     years of film  maybe we could build a narrative that would deliver meaning to the fragmented and restless world of the young. Given the access to technology  even a school in a tiny rural hamlet could project a DVD onto a white board. In the first nine months we ran    clubs across the U.K.  with kids in age groups between five and    watching a film uninterrupted for    minutes. The films were curated and contextualized. But the choice was theirs  and our audience quickly grew to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide. The outcome  immediate. It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind. In groups as large as     and as small as three  these young people discovered new places  new thoughts  new perspectives. By the time the pilot had finished  we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join. The film that changed my life is a      film by Vittorio De Sica   Miracle in Milan.  It's a remarkable comment on slums  poverty and aspiration. I had seen the film on the occasion of my father's   th birthday. Technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema  find and pay for the print and the projectionist. But for my father  the emotional and artistic importance of De Sica's vision was so great that he chose to celebrate his half century with his three teenage children and    of their friends   In order   he said   to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation.  In the last shot of  Miracle in Milan   slum dwellers float skyward on flying brooms. Sixty years after the film was made and    years after I first saw it  I see young faces tilt up in awe  their incredulity matching mine. And the speed with which they associate it with  Slumdog Millionaire  or the favelas in Rio speaks to the enduring nature. In a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government  we screened  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.  Made in       the film is older than most of our members' grandparents. Frank Capra's classic values independence and propriety. It shows how to do right  how to be heroically awkward. It is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor. Shortly after  Mr. Smith  became a FILMCLUB classic  there was a week of all night filibustering in the House of Lords. And it was with great delight that we found young people up and down the country explaining with authority what filibustering was and why the Lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle. After all  Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels. In choosing  Hotel Rwanda   they explored genocide of the most brutal kind. It provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace keeping forces and the double dealing of a Western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind. And when  Schindler's List  demanded that they never forget  one child  full of the pain of consciousness  remarked   We already forgot  otherwise how did 'Hotel Rwanda' happen   As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer.  Pickpocket  started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement.  To Sir  with Love  ignited its teen audience. They celebrated a change in attitude towards non white Britons  but railed against our restless school system that does not value collective identity  unlike that offered by Sidney Poitier's careful tutelage. By now  these thoughtful  opinionated  curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms    black and white  subtitled  documentary  non narrative  fantasy    and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose. Six thousand reviews each school week vying for the honor of being review of the week. From    clubs  we became hundreds  then thousands  until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in       clubs right across the country. And although the numbers were  and continue to be  extraordinary  what became more extraordinary was how the experience of critical and curious questioning translated into life. Some of our kids started talking with their parents  others with their teachers  or with their friends. And those without friends started making them. The films provided communality across all manner of divide. And the stories they held provided a shared experience.  Persepolis  brought a daughter closer to her Iranian mother  and  Jaws  became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear he'd experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother  the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey. Who was right  who wrong  What would they do under the same conditions  Was the tale told well  Was there a hidden message  How has the world changed  How could it be different  A tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children who the world didn't think were interested. And they themselves had not known they cared. And as they wrote and debated  rather than seeing the films as artifacts  they began to see themselves. I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller. In a moment she can invoke images of running barefoot on Table Mountain and playing cops and robbers. Quite recently she told me that in       two of her sisters and my father traveled on a boat to Israel without my grandparents. When the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions  it was these teenagers that fed the crew. I was past    when my father died. He never mentioned that journey. My mother's mother left Europe in a hurry without her husband  but with her three year old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt. After two years in hiding  my grandfather appeared in London. He was never right again. And his story was hushed as he assimilated. My story started in England with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents. I had  Anne Frank    The Great Escape    Shoah    Triumph of the Will.  It was Leni Riefenstahl in her elegant Nazi propaganda who gave context to what the family had to endure. These films held what was too hurtful to say out loud  and they became more useful to me than the whispers of survivors and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo on a maiden aunt's wrist. Purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding  that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history  or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth. But within the reels lie purpose and meaning. As one    year old said after watching  Wizard of Oz    Every person should watch this  because unless you do you may not know that you too have a heart.  We honor reading  why not honor watching with the same passion  Consider  Citizen Kane  as valuable as Jane Austen. Agree that  Boyz n the Hood   like Tennyson  offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding that work together. Each a piece of memorable art  each a brick in the wall of who we are. And it's okay if we remember Tom Hanks better than astronaut Jim Lovell or have Ben Kingsley's face superimposed onto that of Gandhi's. And though not real  Eve Harrington  Howard Beale  Mildred Pierce are an opportunity to discover what it is to be human  and no less helpful to understanding our life and times as Shakespeare is in illuminating the world of Elizabethan England. We guessed that film  whose stories are a meeting place of drama  music  literature and human experience  would engage and inspire the young people participating in FILMCLUB. What we could not have foreseen was the measurable improvements in behavior  confidence and academic achievement. Once reluctant students now race to school  talk to their teachers  fight  not on the playground  but to choose next week's film    young people who have found self definition  ambition and an appetite for education and social engagement from the stories they have witnessed. Our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young. They are neither feral nor myopically self absorbed. They are  like other young people  negotiating a world with infinite choice  but little culture of how to find meaningful experience. We appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes  yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered. If we want different values we have to tell a different story  a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person's identity  that a collective narrative is an essential component of a cultural identity  and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group. Because when these people get home after a screening of  Rear Window  and raise their gaze to the building next door  they have the tools to wonder who  apart from them  is out there and what is their story. Thank you. When I was a child growing up in Maine  one of my favorite things to do was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine  because my parents told me it would bring me luck. But you know  these shells  they're hard to find. They're covered in sand  they're difficult to see. However  over time  I got used to looking for them. I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them. This grew into a passion for finding things  a love for the past and archaeology. And eventually  when I started studying Egyptology  I realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough. Because all of the sudden  in Egypt  my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine to one eight hundred miles long  next to the Nile. And my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities. This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery. For trying to map the past  I knew that I had to see differently. So I want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared. This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta called Mendes. And the site visibly appears brown  but when we use the infrared and we process it  all of the sudden  using false color  the site appears as bright pink. What you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape caused by the building materials and activities of the ancient Egyptians. What I want to share with you today is how we've used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city  called Itjtawy  missing for thousands of years. Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital for over four hundred years  at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom  about four thousand years ago. The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt  and the site is really important  because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art  architecture and religion. Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it  indicated within the red circles here  but somewhere within this massive flood plain. This area is huge    it's four miles by three miles in size. The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy  and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east  it covered over the city. So  how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape  Finding it randomly would be the equivalent of locating a needle in a haystack  blindfolded  wearing baseball mitts. So what we did is we used NASA topography data to map out the landscape  very subtle changes. We started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow. But you can see in more detail  and even more interesting  this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy. So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists to do coring work  which you see here. When I say coring  it's like ice coring  but instead of layers of climate change  you're looking for layers of human occupation. And  five meters down  underneath a thick layer of mud  we found a dense layer of pottery. What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy  five meters down  we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years  dating to the Middle Kingdom  dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is. We also found work stone    carnelian  quartz and agate that shows that there was a jeweler's workshop here. These might not look like much  but when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom  these are the stones that were used. So  we have a dense layer of occupation dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site. We also have evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop  showing that whatever was there was a very important city. No Itjtawy was here yet  but we're going to be returning to the site in the near future to map it out. And even more importantly  we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well. So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom    it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy four thousand years ago.  Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings. There's nothing like it in the land.  So as it turns out  TED was not founded in      AD. Making ideas actually started in      BC at a not lost for long city  found from above. It certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective. Thank you very much. Thank you. When I was about    years old I can remember flipping through channels at home during summer vacation  looking for a movie to watch on HBO    and how many of you remember  Ferris Bueller's Day Off   Oh yeah  great movie  right     Well  I saw Matthew Broderick on the screen  and so I thought   Sweet  Ferris Bueller. I'll watch this   It wasn't Ferris Bueller. And forgive me Matthew Broderick  I know you've done other movies besides Ferris Bueller  but that's how I remember you  you're Ferris. But you weren't doing Ferris y things at the time  you were doing gay things at the time. He was in a movie called  Torch Song Trilogy.  And  Torch Song Trilogy  was based on a play about this drag queen who essentially was looking for love. Love and respect    that's what the whole film was about. And as I'm watching it  I'm realizing that they're talking about me. Not the drag queen part    I am not shaving my hair for anyone    but the gay part. The finding love and respect  the part about trying to find your place in the world. So as I'm watching this  I see this powerful scene that brought me to tears  and it stuck with me for the past    years. And there's this quote that the main character  Arnold  tells his mother as they're fighting about who he is and the life that he lives.  There's one thing more    there's just one more thing you better understand. I've taught myself to sew  cook  fix plumbing  build furniture  I can even pat myself on the back when necessary  all so I don't have to ask anyone for anything. There's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect  and anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life.  I remember that scene like it was yesterday  I was     I was in tears  I was in the closet  and I'm looking at these two people  Ferris Bueller and some guy I'd never seen before  fighting for love. When I finally got to a place in my life where I came out and accepted who I was  and was really quite happy  to tell you the truth  I was happily gay and I guess that's supposed to be right because gay means happy too. I realized there were a lot of people who weren't as gay as I was    gay being happy  not gay being attracted to the same sex. In fact  I heard that there was a lot of hate and a lot of anger and a lot of frustration and a lot of fear about who I was and the gay lifestyle. Now  I'm sitting here trying to figure out  the gay lifestyle    the gay lifestyle   and I keep hearing this word over and over and over again  lifestyle  lifestyle  lifestyle. I've even heard politicians say that the gay lifestyle is a greater threat to civilization than terrorism. That's when I got scared. Because I'm thinking  if I'm gay and I'm doing something that's going to destroy civilization  I need to figure out what this stuff is  and I need to stop doing it right now. So  I took a look at my life  a hard look at my life  and I saw some things very disturbing. And I want to begin sharing these evil things that I've been doing with you  starting with my mornings. I drink coffee. Not only do I drink coffee  I know other gay people who drink coffee. I get stuck in traffic    evil  evil traffic. Sometimes I get stuck in lines at airports. I look around  and I go   My God  look at all these gay people  We're all trapped in these lines  These long lines trying to get on an airplane  My God  this lifestyle that I'm living is so freaking evil   I clean up. This is not an actual photograph of my son's room  his is messier. And because I have a    year old  all I do is cook and cook and cook. Any parents out there of teenagers  All we do is cook for these people    they eat two  three  four dinners a night    it's ridiculous  This is the gay lifestyle. And after I'm done cooking and cleaning and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic  my partner and I  we get together and we decide that we're gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun. We're usually in bed before we find out who's eliminated on  American Idol.  We have to wake up and find out the next day who's still on because we're too freaking tired to hear who stays on. This is the super duper evil gay lifestyle. Run for your heterosexual lives  people. When my partner  Steve  and I first started dating  he told me this story about penguins. And I didn't know where he was going with it at first. He was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me  but he told me that when a penguin finds a mate that they want to spend the rest of their life with  they present them with a pebble    the perfect pebble. And then he reaches into his pocket  and he brings this out to me. And I looked at it  and I was like  this is really cool. And he says   I want to spend the rest of my life with you.  So I wear this whenever I have to do something that makes me a little nervous  like  I don't know  a TEDx talk. I wear this when I am apart from him for a long period of time. And sometimes I just wear it just because. How many people out there are in love  Anyone in love out there  You might be gay. Because I  too  am in love  and apparently that's part of the gay lifestyle that I warned you about. You may want to tell your spouse. Who  if they're in love  might be gay as well. How many of you are single  Any single people out there  You too might be gay  Because I know some gay people who are also single. It's really scary  this gay lifestyle thing  it's super duper evil and there's no end to it  It goes and goes and engulfs  It's really quite silly  isn't it  That's why I'm so happy to finally hear President Obama come out and say that he supports    that he supports marriage equality. It's a wonderful day in our country's history  it's a wonderful day in the globe's history to be able to have an actual sitting president say  enough of this    first to himself  and then to the rest of the world. It's wonderful. But there's something that's been disturbing me since he made that remark just a short time ago. And that is  apparently  this is just another move by the gay activists that's on the gay agenda. And I'm disturbed by this because I've been openly gay now for quite some time. I've been to all of the functions  I've been to fundraisers  I've written about the topic  and I have yet to receive my copy of this gay agenda. I've paid my dues on time  I've marched in gay pride flags parades and the whole nine  and I've yet to see a copy of the gay agenda. It's very  very frustrating  and I was feeling left out  like I wasn't quite gay enough. But then something wonderful happened  I was out shopping  as I tend to do  and I came across a bootleg copy of the official gay agenda. And I said to myself   LZ  for so long  you have been denied this. When you get in front of this crowd  you're gonna share the news. You're gonna spread the gay agenda so no one else has to wonder  what exactly is in the gay agenda  What are these gays up to  What do they want   So  without further ado  I will present to you  ladies and gentlemen    now be careful  'cause it's evil    a copy  the official copy  of the gay agenda. The gay agenda  people  There it is  Did you soak it all in  The gay agenda. Some of you may be calling it  what  the Constitution of the United States  is that what you call it too  The U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda. These gays  people like me  want to be treated like full citizens and it's all written down in plain sight. I was blown away when I saw it. I was like  wait  this is the gay agenda  Why didn't you just call it the Constitution so I knew what you were talking about  I wouldn't have been so confused  I wouldn't have been so upset. But there it is. The gay agenda. Run for your heterosexual lives. Did you know that in all the states where there is no shading that people who are gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered can be kicked out of their apartments for being gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered  That's the only reason that a landlord needs to have them removed  because there's no protection from discrimination of GLBT people. Did you know in the states where there's no shading that you can be fired for being gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered  Not based upon the quality of your work  how long you've been there  if you stink  just if you're gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered. All of which flies in the face of the gay agenda  also known as the U.S. Constitution. Specifically  this little amendment right here   No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.  I'm looking at you  North Carolina. But you're not looking at the U.S. Constitution. This is the gay agenda  equality. Not special rights  but the rights that were already written by these people    these elitists  if you will. Educated  well dressed  some would dare say questionably dressed. Nonetheless  our forefathers  right  The people that  we say  knew what they were doing when they wrote the Constitution    the gay agenda  if you will. All of that flies in the face of what they did. That is the reason why I felt it was imperative that I presented you with this copy of the gay agenda. Because I figured if I made it funny  you wouldn't be as threatened. I figured if I was a bit irreverent  you wouldn't find it serious. But when you see the map  and you see our state of Michigan    it's legal to fire someone for being gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered  that it's legal to remove someone from their home because they're gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered  then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality is not about stripping someone's rights away  it's about granting them the rights that  have  already been stated. And we're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated  that we've already agreed upon. There are people living in fear of losing their jobs so they don't show anyone who they really are right here at home. This isn't just about North Carolina  all those states that were clear  it's legal. If I could brag for a second  I have a    year old son from my marriage. He has a  . . He is starting a new club at school  Policy Debate. He's a budding track star  he has almost every single record in middle school for every event that he competed in. He volunteers. He prays before he eats. I would like to think  as his father    and he lives with me primarily    that I had a little something to do with all of that. I would like to think that he's a good boy  a respectful young man. I would like to think that I've proven to be a capable father. But if I were to go to the state of Michigan today  and try to adopt a young person who is in an orphanage  I would be disqualified for only one reason  because I'm gay. It doesn't matter what I've already proven  what I can do with my heart. It's because of what the state of Michigan says that I am that I am disqualified for any sort of adoption. And that's not just about me  that's about so many other Michiganders  U.S. citizens  who don't understand why what they are is so much more significant than who they are. This story just keeps playing over and over and over again in our country's history. There was a time in which  I don't know  people who were black couldn't have the same rights. People who happened to be women didn't have the same rights  couldn't vote. There was a point in our history in which  if you were considered disabled  that an employer could just fire you  before the Americans with Disabilities Act. We keep doing this over and over again. And so here we are        gay agenda  gay lifestyle  and I'm not a good dad and people don't deserve to be able to protect their families because of what they are  not who they are. So when you hear the words  gay lifestyle  and  gay agenda  in the future  I encourage you to do two things  One  remember the U.S. Constitution  and then two  if you wouldn't mind looking to your left  please. Look to your right. That person next to you is a brother  is a sister. And they should be treated with love and respect. Thank you. So  that's what I've done with my life.  Laughter  Thank you.  Applause  As a kid  I grew up on a farm in Florida  and I did what most little kids do. I played a little baseball  did a few other things like that  but I always had the sense of being an outsider  and it wasn't until I saw pictures in the magazines that a couple other guys skate  I thought   Wow  that's for me   you know  Because there was no coach standing directly over you  and these guys  they were just being themselves. There was no opponent directly across from you. And I loved that sense  so I started skating when I was about    years old  in       and when I did  I picked it up pretty quickly. In fact  here's some footage from about     . It wasn't until '   I won my first amateur championship  and then  by '    I was     and I won my first world championship  which was amazing to me  and in a very real sense  that was the first real victory I had. Oh  watch this. This is a casper slide  where the board's upside down. Mental note on that one.  Laughs  And this one here  An ollie. So  as she mentioned  that is overstated for sure  but that's why they called me the godfather of modern street skating. Here's some images of that. Now  I was about halfway through my pro career in  I would say  the mid '  s. Freestyle itself  we developed all these flat ground tricks as you saw  but there was evolving a new kind of skateboarding  where guys were taking it to the streets  and they were using that ollie  like I showed you  They were using it to get up onto stuff like bleachers and handrails and over stairwells and all kinds of cool stuff. So it was evolving upwards. In fact  when someone tells you they're a skater today  they pretty much mean a street skater  because freestyle  it took about five years for it to die  and at that stage  I'd been a  champion  champion for    years  which  phew  And suddenly it was over for me. That's it. It was gone. They took my pro model off the shelf  which was essentially pronouncing you dead publicly. That's how you make your money  you know  You have a signature board and wheels and shoes and clothes. I had all that stuff  and it's gone. The crazy thing was  there was a really liberating sense about it  because I no longer had to protect my record as a champion.  Champion   again. Champion sounds so goofy  but it's what it was  right  And I got to    What drew me to skateboarding  the freedom was now restored  where I could just create things  because that's where the joy was for me  always  was creating new stuff. The other thing that I had was a deep well of tricks to draw from that were rooted in these flat ground tricks. Stuff the normal guys were doing was very much different. So  as humbling and rotten as it was   And believe me  it was rotten. I would go to skate spots  and I was already  like   famous guy   right  And everyone thought I was good. But in this new terrain  I was horrible. So people would go   Oh  he's all    Oh  what happened to Mullen    Laughter   Laughs  So  humbling as it was  I began again. Here are some tricks that I started to bring to that new terrain.  Skateboard noises  And again  there's this undergirding layer of influence of freestyle that made me   Oh  that one  That's  like  the hardest thing I've ever done. Okay  look at that. It's a darkslide. See how it's sliding on the backside  Those are super fun.  Laughter  And  actually  not that hard. You know  at the very root of that  see  caspers  see how you throw it   Skateboard noises  Simple as that  right  No biggie.  Laughter  And your front foot  the way it grabs it  is    I'd seen someone slide on the back of the board like that  and I was like   How can I get it over   Because that had not yet been done. And then it dawned on me  and here's part of what I'm saying. I had an infrastructure. I had this deep layer  where it was like  oh my gosh  it's just your foot. It's just the way you throw your board over. Just let the ledge do that  and it's easy  and the next thing you know  there's    more tricks based out of the variations. So that's the kind of thing that  here  check this out  here's another way  and I won't overdo this. A little indulgent  I understand. There's something called a primo slide. It is the funnest trick ever to do. It's like skinboarding. And this one  look how it slides sideways  every which way  Okay  so when you're skating  and you take a fall  the board slips that way or that way. It's kind of predictable. This  It goes every which way. It's like a cartoon  the falls  and that's what I love the most about it. It's so much fun to do. In fact  when I started doing them  I remember  because I got hurt. I had to get a knee surgery  right  So there were a couple of days where  actually a couple of weeks  where I couldn't skate at all. It would give out on me. And I would watch the guys  I'd go to this warehouse where a lot of the guys were skating  my friends  and I was like   Man I gotta do something new. I want to do something new. I want to start fresh. I want to start fresh.  And so the night before my surgery  I'd watched  and I was like   How am I going to do this   So I ran up  and I jumped on my board  and I cavemanned  and I flipped it down  and I remember thinking  I landed so light footed  thinking  if my knee gives  they'll just have more work to do in the morning. And so  when it was the crazy thing. I don't know how many of you guys have had surgery  but     Laughter     you are so helpless  right  You're on this gurney and you're watching the ceiling go by  every time it's always that  and right when they're putting the mask on you before you go to sleep  all I was thinking is   Man  when I wake up and I get better  the first thing I'm going to do is film that trick.   Laughter  And indeed I did. It was the very first thing I filmed  which was awesome. Now  let me    I told you a little bit about the evolution of the tricks. Consider that content  in a sense. What we do as street skaters is  you have these tricks. Say I'm working on darkslides  or a primo  that you guys know this stuff now.  Laughter   Laughs  What you do is you cruise around the same streets that you've seen a hundred times  but suddenly  because you already have something in this fixed domain of this target  it's like  what will match this trick  How can I expand  how can the context  how can the environment change the very nature of what I do  So you drive and drive and drive  and  actually I gotta admit  just because I was struggling with this because I'm here  but I'll just say it  is  I cannot tell you  not only to be here in front of you  but what a privilege it is to be at USC campus  because I have been escorted off of this campus so many times.  Laughter  So let me give you another example of how context shapes content. This is a place not that far from here. It's a rotten neighborhood. Your first consideration is  am I gonna get beat up  You go out and    See this wall  It's fairly mellow  and it's beckoning to do bank tricks  right  But there's this other aspect of it for wheelies  so check this out. There's a few tricks  again  how environment changes the nature of your tricks. Freestyle oriented  manual down    wheelie down. Watch  this one  Oh  I love this. It's like surfing  this one  the way you catch it. This one  a little sketchy going backwards  and watch the back foot  watch the back foot. Oop.  Laughs  Mental note right there. Again  we'll get back to that. Here. Back foot  back foot. Okay  up there  That was called a     flip. Notice how the board flipped and spun this way  both axes. And another example of how the context changed  and the creative process for me and for most skaters  is  you go  you get out of the car  you check for security  you check for stuff.  Laughter  It's funny  you get to know their rhythms  you know  the guys that cruise around  and skateboarding is such a humbling thing  man. No matter how good you are  right  you still gotta deal with   So you hit this wall  and when I hit it  the first thing you do is you fall forward  and I'm like  all right  all right. As you adjust  you punch it up  and then when I would do that  it was throwing my shoulder this way  which as I was doing it  I was like   Oh wow  that's begging for a     flip   because that's how you load up for a     flip. And so this is what I want to emphasize that  as you can imagine  all of these tricks are made of sub movements  executive motor functions  more granular to the degree to which I can't quite tell you  but one thing I do know is  every trick is made of combining two or three or four or five movements. And so  as I'm going up  these things are floating around  and you have to sort of let the cognitive mind  like  rest back  pull it back a little bit  and let your intuition go as you feel these things. And these sub movements are just kind of floating around  and as the wall hits you  they connect themselves to an extent  and that's when the cognitive mind  you think   Oh      flip  I'm going to make that.  So that's how that works to me  the creative process  the process itself of street skating. So  next   Oh  mind you.  Laughs  Those are the community. These are some of the best skaters in the world. These are my friends. Oh my gosh  they're such good people. And the beauty of skateboarding is that  no one guy is the best. In fact  I know this is rotten to say  they're my friends  but a couple of them actually don't look that comfortable on their board. What makes them great is the degree to which they use their skateboarding to individuate themselves. Every single one of these guys  you look at them  you can see a silhouette of them  and you realize  like   Oh  that's him  that's Haslam  that's Koston  there's these guys  these are the guys. And skaters  I think they tend to be outsiders who seek a sense of belonging  but belonging on their own terms  and real respect is given by how much we take what other guys do  these basic tricks      flips  we take that  we make it our own  and then we contribute back to the community the inner way that edifies the community itself. The greater the contribution  the more we express and form our individuality  which is so important to a lot of us who feel like rejects to begin with. The summation of that gives us something we could never achieve as an individual. I should say this. There's some sort of beautiful symmetry that the degree to which we connect to a community is in proportion to our individuality  which we are expressing by what we do. Next. These guys. Very similar community that's extremely conducive to innovation. Notice a couple of these shots from the Police Department. But it is quite similar. I mean  what is it to hack  right  It's knowing a technology so well that you can manipulate it and steer it to do things it was never intended to do  right  And they're not all bad. You can be a Linux kernel hacker  make it more stable  right  More safe  more secure. You can be an iOS hacker  make your iPhone do stuff it wasn't supposed to. Not authorized  but not illegal. And then you've got some of these guys  right  What they do is very similar to our creative process. They connect disparate information  and they bring it together in a way that a security analyst doesn't expect. Right  It doesn't make them good people  but it's at the heart of engineering  at the heart of a creative community  an innovative community  and the open source community  the basic ethos of it is  take what other people do  make it better  give it back so we all rise further. Very similar communities  very similar. We have our edgier sides  too. It's funny  my dad was right. These are my peers. But I respect what they do  and they respect what I do  because they can do things. It's amazing what they can do. In fact  one of them  he was Ernst   Young's Entrepreneur of the Year for San Diego County  so they're not  you never know who you're dealing with. We've all had some degree of fame. In fact  I've had so much success that I strangely always feel unworthy of. I've had a patent  and that was cool  and we started a company  and it grew  and it became the biggest  and then it went down  and then it became the biggest again  which is harder than the first time  and then we sold it  and then we sold it again. So I've had some success. And in the end  when you've had all of these things  what is it that continues to drive you  As I mentioned  the knee stuff and these things  what is it that will punch you  Because it's not just the mind. What is it that will punch you and make you do something and bring it to another level  and when you've had it all  sometimes  guys  they die on the vine with all of that talent  and one of the things we've had  all of us  is fame  I think the best kind of fame  because you can take it off. I've been all around the world  and there will be a thousand kids crying out your name  and it's such a weird  visceral experience. It's like  it's disorienting. And you get in a car  and you drive away  and    minute drive  and you get out  and no one gives a rat's who you are.  Laughs  And it gives you that clarity of perspective of  man  I'm just me  and popularity  what does that really mean again  Not much. It's peer respect that drives us. That's the one thing that makes us do what we do. I've had over a dozen bones  these guys  this guy  over  what  eight     concussions  to the point where it's comedy  right  It is actually comedy. They mess with him. Next. And this is something deeper  and this is where I'm   I think I was on tour when I  I was reading one of the Feynman biographies. It was the red one or the blue one. And he made this statement that was so profound to me. It was that the Nobel Prize was the tombstone on all great work  and it resonated because I had won    out of    contests that I'd entered over    years  and it made me bananas. In fact  winning isn't the word. I won it once. The rest of the time  you're just defending  and you get into this  like  turtle posture  you know  Where you're not doing. It usurped the joy of what I loved to do because I was no longer doing it to create and have fun  and when it died out from under me  that was one of the most liberating things because I could create. And look  I understand that I am on the very edge of preachy  right here. I'm not here to do that. It's just that I'm in front of a very privileged audience. If you guys aren't already leaders in your community  you probably will be  and if there's anything I can give you that will transcend what I've gotten from skateboarding  the only things of meaning  I think  and of permanence  it's not fame  it's not all these things. What it is is that there's an intrinsic value in creating something for the sake of creating it  and better than that  because  man  I'm    years old  or I'll be     and how pathetic is that I'm still skateboarding  but there is   a community of your own making  and seeing it dispersed  and seeing younger  more talented  just different talent  take it to levels you can never imagine  because that lives on. So thank you for your time. Krisztina Holly  I have a question for you. So you've really reinvented yourself in the past from freestyle to street  and  I think it was about four years ago you officially retired. Is that it  What's next  Rodney Mullen  That's a good question. KH  Something tells me it's not the end. RM  Yeah. I  every time you think you've chased something down  it's funny  no matter how good you are  and I know guys like this  it feels like you're polishing a turd. You know   Laughter  And I thought  the only way I can extend this is to change something infrastructural  and so that's what I proceeded to do  through a long story  one of desperation  so if I do it  rather than talk about it  if I do it  you'll be the first to know. KH  All right  we won't ask you any more. RM  You'll get a text. KH   Laughs  Right. Thank you. Good job.  Applause  RM  Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Like most journalists  I'm an idealist. I love unearthing good stories  especially untold stories. I just didn't think that in       women would still be in that category. I'm the President of the Journalism and Women Symposium    JAWS. That's Sharky. I joined    years ago because I wanted female role models  and I was frustrated by the lagging status of women in our profession and what that meant for our image in the media. We make up half the population of the world  but we're just    percent of the news subjects quoted in news stories. And we're just    percent of the experts quoted in stories. And now  with today's technology  it's possible to remove women from the picture completely. This is a picture of President Barack Obama and his advisors  tracking the killing of Osama bin Laden. You can see Hillary Clinton on the right. Let's see how the photo ran in an Orthodox Jewish newspaper based in Brooklyn. Hillary's completely gone. The paper apologized  but said it never runs photos of women  they might be sexually provocative. This is an extreme case  yes. But the fact is  women are only    percent of the sources in stories on politics  and only    percent in stories on the economy. The news continues to give us a picture where men outnumber women in nearly all occupational categories  except two  students and homemakers. So we all get a very distorted picture of reality. The problem is  of course  there aren't enough women in newsrooms. They report at just    percent of stories in print  TV and radio. Even in stories on gender based violence  men get an overwhelming majority of print space and airtime. Case in point  This March  the New York Times ran a story by James McKinley about a gang rape of a young girl     years old  in a small Texas town. McKinley writes that the community is wondering   How could their boys have been drawn into this    Drawn into this     like they were seduced into committing an act of violence. And the first person he quotes says   These boys will have to live with this the rest of their lives.  You don't hear much about the    year old victim  except that she wore clothes that were a little old for her and she wore makeup. The Times was deluged with criticism. Initially  it defended itself  and said   These aren't our views. This is what we found in our reporting.  Now  here's a secret you probably know already  Your stories are constructed. As reporters  we research  we interview. We try to give a good picture of reality. We also have our own unconscious biases. But The Times makes it sound like anyone would have reported this story the same way. I disagree with that. So three weeks later  The Times revisits the story. This time  it adds another byline to it with McKinley's  Erica Goode. What emerges is a truly sad  horrific tale of a young girl and her family trapped in poverty. She was raped numerous times by many men. She had been a bright  easygoing girl. She was maturing quickly  physically  but her bed was still covered with stuffed animals. It's a very different picture. Perhaps the addition of Ms. Goode is what made this story more complete. The Global Media Monitoring Project has found that stories by female reporters are more likely to challenge stereotypes than those by male reporters. At KUNM here in Albuquerque  Elaine Baumgartel did some graduate research on the coverage of violence against women. What she found was many of these stories tend to blame victims and devalue their lives. They tend to sensationalize  and they lack context. So for her graduate work  she did a three part series on the murder of    women  found buried on Albuquerque's West Mesa. She tried to challenge those patterns and stereotypes in her work and she tried to show the challenges that journalists face from external sources  their own internal biases and cultural norms. And she worked with an editor at National Public Radio to try to get a story aired nationally. She's not sure that would have happened if the editor had not been a female. Stories in the news are more than twice as likely to present women as victims than men  and women are more likely to be defined by their body parts. Wired magazine  November     . Yes  the issue was about breast tissue engineering. Now I know you're all distracted  so I'll take that off. Eyes up here. So    Here's the thing  Wired almost never puts women on its cover. Oh  there have been some gimmicky ones    Pam from  The Office   manga girls  a voluptuous model covered in synthetic diamonds. Texas State University professor Cindy Royal wondered in her blog how are young women like her students supposed to feel about their roles in technology  reading Wired. Chris Anderson  the editor of Wired  defended his choice and said there aren't enough women  prominent women in technology to sell a cover  to sell an issue. Part of that is true  there aren't as many prominent women in technology. Here's my problem with that argument  Media tells us every day what's important  by the stories they choose and where they place them  it's called agenda setting. How many people knew the founders of Facebook and Google before their faces were on a magazine cover  Putting them there made them more recognizable. Now  Fast Company Magazine embraces that idea. This is its cover from November         . The issue is about the most prominent and influential women in technology. Editor Robert Safian told the Poynter Institute   Silicon Valley is very white and very male. But that's not what Fast Company thinks the business world will look like in the future  so it tries to give a picture of where the globalized world is moving.  By the way  apparently  Wired took all this to heart. This was its issue in April. That's Limor Fried  the founder of Adafruit Industries  in the Rosie the Riveter pose. It would help to have more women in positions of leadership in media. A recent global survey found that    percent of the top media management jobs are still held by men. But this is also about something far more complex  our own unconscious biases and blind spots. Shankar Vedantam is the author of  The Hidden Brain  How Our Unconscious Minds Elect Presidents  Control Markets  Wage Wars  and Save Our Lives.  He told the former ombudsman at National Public Radio  who was doing a report on how women fare in NPR coverage  unconscious bias flows throughout most of our lives. It's really difficult to disentangle those strands. But he did have one suggestion. He used to work for two editors who said every story had to have at least one female source. He balked at first  but said he eventually followed the directive happily  because his stories got better and his job got easier. Now  I don't know if one of the editors was a woman  but that can make the biggest difference. The Dallas Morning News won a Pulitzer Prize in      for a series it did on women around the world  but one of the reporters told me she's convinced it never would have happened if they had not had a female assistant foreign editor  and they would not have gotten some of those stories without female reporters and editors on the ground  particularly one on female genital mutilation    men would just not be allowed into those situations. This is an important point to consider  because much of our foreign policy now revolves around countries where the treatment of women is an issue  such as Afghanistan. What we're told in terms of arguments against leaving this country is that the fate of the women is primary. Now  I'm sure a male reporter in Kabul can find women to interview. Not so sure about rural  traditional areas  where I'm guessing women can't talk to strange men. It's important to keep talking about this  in light of Lara Logan. She was the CBS News correspondent who was brutally sexually assaulted in Egypt's Tahrir Square  right after this photo was taken. Almost immediately  pundits weighed in  blaming her and saying things like   You know  maybe women shouldn't be sent to cover those stories.  I never heard anyone say this about Anderson Cooper and his crew  who were attacked covering the same story. One way to get more women into leadership is to have other women mentor them. One of my board members is an editor at a major global media company  but she never thought about this as a career path  until she met female role models at JAWS. But this is not just a job for super journalists or my organization. You all have a stake in a strong  vibrant media. Analyze your news. And speak up when there are gaps missing in coverage  like people at The New York Times did. Suggest female sources to reporters and editors. Remember    a complete picture of reality may depend upon it. And I'll leave you with a video clip that I first saw in        when I was a student in London. It's for The Guardian newspaper. It's actually long before I ever thought about becoming a journalist  but I was very interested in how we learn to perceive our world. Narrator  An event seen from one point of view gives one impression. Seen from another point of view  it gives quite a different impression. But it's only when you get the whole picture  you can fully understand what's going on.  The Guardian  Megan Kamerick  I think you'll all agree that we'd be better off if we all had the whole picture. Two weeks ago  I was sitting at the kitchen table with my wife Katya  and we were talking about what I was going to talk about today. We have an    year old son  his name is Lincoln. He was sitting at the same table  doing his math homework. And during a pause in my conversation with Katya  I looked over at Lincoln and I was suddenly thunderstruck by a recollection of a client of mine. My client was a guy named Will. He was from North Texas. He never knew his father very well  because his father left his mom while she was pregnant with him. And so  he was destined to be raised by a single mom  which might have been all right except that this particular single mom was a paranoid schizophrenic  and when Will was five years old  she tried to kill him with a butcher knife. She was taken away by authorities and placed in a psychiatric hospital  and so for the next several years Will lived with his older brother  until he committed suicide by shooting himself through the heart. And after that Will bounced around from one family member to another  until  by the time he was nine years old  he was essentially living on his own. That morning that I was sitting with Katya and Lincoln  I looked at my son  and I realized that when my client  Will  was his age  he'd been living by himself for two years. Will eventually joined a gang and committed a number of very serious crimes  including  most seriously of all  a horrible  tragic murder. And Will was ultimately executed as punishment for that crime. But I don't want to talk today about the morality of capital punishment. I certainly think that my client shouldn't have been executed  but what I would like to do today instead is talk about the death penalty in a way I've never done before  in a way that is entirely noncontroversial. I think that's possible  because there is a corner of the death penalty debate    maybe the most important corner    where everybody agrees  where the most ardent death penalty supporters and the most vociferous abolitionists are on exactly the same page. That's the corner I want to explore. Before I do that  though  I want to spend a couple of minutes telling you how a death penalty case unfolds  and then I want to tell you two lessons that I have learned over the last    years as a death penalty lawyer from watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way. You can think of a death penalty case as a story that has four chapters. The first chapter of every case is exactly the same  and it is tragic. It begins with the murder of an innocent human being  and it's followed by a trial where the murderer is convicted and sent to death row  and that death sentence is ultimately upheld by the state appellate court. The second chapter consists of a complicated legal proceeding known as a state habeas corpus appeal. The third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding known as a federal habeas corpus proceeding. And the fourth chapter is one where a variety of things can happen. The lawyers might file a clemency petition  they might initiate even more complex litigation  or they might not do anything at all. But that fourth chapter always ends with an execution. When I started representing death row inmates more than    years ago  people on death row did not have a right to a lawyer in either the second or the fourth chapter of this story. They were on their own. In fact  it wasn't until the late     s that they acquired a right to a lawyer during the third chapter of the story. So what all of these death row inmates had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers to handle their legal proceedings. The problem is that there were way more guys on death row than there were lawyers who had both the interest and the expertise to work on these cases. And so inevitably  lawyers drifted to cases that were already in chapter four    that makes sense  of course. Those are the cases that are most urgent  those are the guys who are closest to being executed. Some of these lawyers were successful  they managed to get new trials for their clients. Others of them managed to extend the lives of their clients  sometimes by years  sometimes by months. But the one thing that didn't happen was that there was never a serious and sustained decline in the number of annual executions in Texas. In fact  as you can see from this graph  from the time that the Texas execution apparatus got efficient in the mid  to late     s  there have only been a couple of years where the number of annual executions dipped below   . In a typical year in Texas  we're averaging about two people a month. In some years in Texas  we've executed close to    people  and this number has never significantly declined over the last    years. And yet  at the same time that we continue to execute about the same number of people every year  the number of people who we're sentencing to death on an annual basis has dropped rather steeply. So we have this paradox  which is that the number of annual executions has remained high but the number of new death sentences has gone down. Why is that  It can't be attributed to a decline in the murder rate  because the murder rate has not declined nearly so steeply as the red line on that graph has gone down. What has happened instead is that juries have started to sentence more and more people to prison for the rest of their lives without the possibility of parole  rather than sending them to the execution chamber. Why has that happened  It hasn't happened because of a dissolution of popular support for the death penalty. Death penalty opponents take great solace in the fact that death penalty support in Texas is at an all time low. Do you know what all time low in Texas means  It means that it's in the low    percent. Now  that's really good compared to the mid     s  when it was in excess of    percent  but we can't explain the decline in death sentences and the affinity for life without the possibility of parole by an erosion of support for the death penalty  because people still support the death penalty. What's happened to cause this phenomenon  What's happened is that lawyers who represent death row inmates have shifted their focus to earlier and earlier chapters of the death penalty story. So    years ago  they focused on chapter four. And they went from chapter four    years ago to chapter three in the late     s. And they went from chapter three in the late     s to chapter two in the mid     s. And beginning in the mid  to late     s  they began to focus on chapter one of the story. Now  you might think that this decline in death sentences and the increase in the number of life sentences is a good thing or a bad thing. I don't want to have a conversation about that today. All that I want to tell you is that the reason that this has happened is because death penalty lawyers have understood that the earlier you intervene in a case  the greater the likelihood that you're going to save your client's life. That's the first thing I've learned. Here's the second thing I learned  My client Will was not the exception to the rule  he was the rule. I sometimes say  if you tell me the name of a death row inmate    doesn't matter what state he's in  doesn't matter if I've ever met him before    I'll write his biography for you. And eight out of    times  the details of that biography will be more or less accurate. And the reason for that is that    percent of the people on death row are people who came from the same sort of dysfunctional family that Will did. Eighty percent of the people on death row are people who had exposure to the juvenile justice system. That's the second lesson that I've learned. Now we're right on the cusp of that corner where everybody's going to agree. People in this room might disagree about whether Will should have been executed  but I think everybody would agree that the best possible version of his story would be a story where no murder ever occurs. How do we do that  When our son Lincoln was working on that math problem two weeks ago  it was a big  gnarly problem. And he was learning how  when you have a big old gnarly problem  sometimes the solution is to slice it into smaller problems. That's what we do for most problems    in math  in physics  even in social policy    we slice them into smaller  more manageable problems. But every once in a while  as Dwight Eisenhower said  the way you solve a problem is to make it bigger. The way we solve this problem is to make the issue of the death penalty bigger. We have to say  all right. We have these four chapters of a death penalty story  but what happens before that story begins  How can we intervene in the life of a murderer before he's a murderer  What options do we have to nudge that person off of the path that is going to lead to a result that everybody    death penalty supporters and death penalty opponents    still think is a bad result  the murder of an innocent human being  You know  sometimes people say that something isn't rocket science. And by that  what they mean is rocket science is really complicated and this problem that we're talking about now is really simple. Well that's rocket science  that's the mathematical expression for the thrust created by a rocket. What we're talking about today is just as complicated. What we're talking about today is also rocket science. My client Will and    percent of the people on death row had five chapters in their lives that came before the four chapters of the death penalty story. I think of these five chapters as points of intervention  places in their lives when our society could've intervened in their lives and nudged them off of the path that they were on that created a consequence that we all    death penalty supporters or death penalty opponents    say was a bad result. Now  during each of these five chapters  when his mother was pregnant with him  in his early childhood years  when he was in elementary school  when he was in middle school and then high school  and when he was in the juvenile justice system    during each of those five chapters  there were a wide variety of things that society could have done. In fact  if we just imagine that there are five different modes of intervention  the way that society could intervene in each of those five chapters  and we could mix and match them any way we want  there are          more than          possible strategies that we could embrace in order to nudge kids like Will off of the path that they're on. So I'm not standing here today with the solution. But the fact that we still have a lot to learn  that doesn't mean that we don't know a lot already. We know from experience in other states that there are a wide variety of modes of intervention that we could be using in Texas  and in every other state that isn't using them  in order to prevent a consequence that we all agree is bad. I'll just mention a few. I won't talk today about reforming the legal system. That's probably a topic that is best reserved for a room full of lawyers and judges. Instead  let me talk about a couple of modes of intervention that we can all help accomplish  because they are modes of intervention that will come about when legislators and policymakers  when taxpayers and citizens  agree that that's what we ought to be doing and that's how we ought to be spending our money. We could be providing early childhood care for economically disadvantaged and otherwise troubled kids  and we could be doing it for free. And we could be nudging kids like Will off of the path that we're on. There are other states that do that  but we don't. We could be providing special schools  at both the high school level and the middle school level  but even in K    that target economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids  and particularly kids who have had exposure to the juvenile justice system. There are a handful of states that do that  Texas doesn't. There's one other thing we can be doing    well  there are a bunch of other things    there's one other thing that I'm going to mention  and this is going to be the only controversial thing that I say today. We could be intervening much more aggressively into dangerously dysfunctional homes  and getting kids out of them before their moms pick up butcher knives and threaten to kill them. If we're going to do that  we need a place to put them. Even if we do all of those things  some kids are going to fall through the cracks and they're going to end up in that last chapter before the murder story begins  they're going to end up in the juvenile justice system. And even if that happens  it's not yet too late. There's still time to nudge them  if we think about nudging them rather than just punishing them. There are two professors in the Northeast    one at Yale and one at Maryland    they set up a school that is attached to a juvenile prison. And the kids are in prison  but they go to school from eight in the morning until four in the afternoon. Now  it was logistically difficult. They had to recruit teachers who wanted to teach inside a prison  they had to establish strict separation between the people who work at the school and the prison authorities  and most dauntingly of all  they needed to invent a new curriculum because you know what  People don't come into and out of prison on a semester basis. But they did all those things. Now  what do all of these things have in common  What all of these things have in common is that they cost money. Some of the people in the room might be old enough to remember the guy on the old oil filter commercial. He used to say   Well  you can pay me now or you can pay me later.  What we're doing in the death penalty system is we're paying later. But the thing is that for every        dollars that we spend intervening in the lives of economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids in those earlier chapters  we save        dollars in crime related costs down the road. Even if you don't agree that there's a moral imperative that we do it  it just makes economic sense. I want to tell you about the last conversation that I had with Will. It was the day that he was going to be executed  and we were just talking. There was nothing left to do in his case. And we were talking about his life. And he was talking first about his dad  who he hardly knew  who had died  and then about his mom  who he did know  who was still alive. And I said to him   I know the story. I've read the records. I know that she tried to kill you.  I said   But I've always wondered whether you really actually remember that.  I said   I don't remember anything from when I was five years old. Maybe you just remember somebody telling you.  And he looked at me and he leaned forward  and he said   Professor      he'd known me for    years  he still called me Professor. He said   Professor  I don't mean any disrespect by this  but when your mama picks up a butcher knife that looks bigger than you are  and chases you through the house screaming she's going to kill you  and you have to lock yourself in the bathroom and lean against the door and holler for help until the police get there   he looked at me and he said   that's something you don't forget.  I hope there's one thing you all won't forget  In between the time you arrived here this morning and the time we break for lunch  there are going to be four homicides in the United States. We're going to devote enormous social resources to punishing the people who commit those crimes  and that's appropriate because we should punish people who do bad things. But three of those crimes are preventable. If we make the picture bigger and devote our attention to the earlier chapters  then we're never going to write the first sentence that begins the death penalty story. Thank you. Those of you who have seen the film  Moneyball   or have read the book by Michael Lewis  will be familiar with the story of Billy Beane. Billy was supposed to be a tremendous ballplayer  all the scouts told him so. They told his parents that they predicted that he was going to be a star. But what actually happened when he signed the contract    and by the way  he didn't want to sign that contract  he wanted to go to college    which is what my mother  who actually does love me  said that I should do too  and I did    well  he didn't do very well. He struggled mightily. He got traded a couple of times  he ended up in the Minors for most of his career  and he actually ended up in management. He ended up as a General Manager of the Oakland A's. Now for many of you in this room  ending up in management  which is also what I've done  is seen as a success. I can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the Bigs  going into management ain't no success story. It's a failure. And what I want to talk to you about today  and share with you  is that our healthcare system  our medical system  is just as bad at predicting what happens to people in it    patients  others    as those scouts were at predicting what would happen to Billy Beane. And yet  every day thousands of people in this country are diagnosed with preconditions. We hear about pre hypertension  we hear about pre dementia  we hear about pre anxiety  and I'm pretty sure that I diagnosed myself with that in the green room. We also refer to subclinical conditions. There's subclinical atherosclerosis  subclinical hardening of the arteries  obviously linked to heart attacks  potentially. One of my favorites is called subclinical acne. If you look up subclinical acne  you may find a website  which I did  which says that this is the easiest type of acne to treat. You don't have the pustules or the redness and inflammation. Maybe that's because you don't actually have acne. I have a name for all of these conditions  it's another precondition  I call them preposterous. In baseball  the game follows the pre game. Season follows the pre season. But with a lot of these conditions  that actually isn't the case  or at least it isn't the case all the time. It's as if there's a rain delay  every single time in many cases. We have pre cancerous lesions  which often don't turn into cancer. And yet  if you take  for example  subclinical osteoporosis  a bone thinning disease  the precondition  otherwise known as osteopenia  you would have to treat     women for three years in order to prevent one broken bone. That's an awful lot of women when you multiply by the number of women who were diagnosed with this osteopenia. And so is it any wonder  given all of the costs and the side effects of the drugs that we're using to treat these preconditions  that every year we're spending more than two trillion dollars on healthcare and yet         people a year    and that's a conservative estimate    are dying not because of the conditions they have  but because of the treatments that we're giving them and the complications of those treatments  We've medicalized everything in this country. Women in the audience  I have some pretty bad news that you already know  and that's that every aspect of your life has been medicalized. Strike one is when you hit puberty. You now have something that happens to you once a month that has been medicalized. It's a condition  it has to be treated. Strike two is if you get pregnant. That's been medicalized as well. You have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy  otherwise something might go wrong. Strike three is menopause. We all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms for decades until all of a sudden we realized  because a study came out  a big one  NIH funded. It said  actually  a lot of that hormone replacement therapy may be doing more harm than good for many of those women. Just in case  I don't want to leave the men out    I am one  after all    I have really bad news for all of you in this room  and for everyone listening and watching elsewhere  You all have a universally fatal condition. So  just take a moment. It's called pre death. Every single one of you has it  because you have the risk factor for it  which is being alive. But I have some good news for you  because I'm a journalist  I like to end things in a happy way or a forward thinking way. And that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk  which we'll see if that happens for everyone  you will be a pre vivor. I made up pre death. If I used someone else's pre death  I apologize  I think I made it up. I didn't make up pre vivor. Pre vivor is what a particular cancer advocacy group would like everyone who just has a risk factor  but hasn't actually had that cancer  to call themselves. You are a pre vivor. We've had HBO here this morning. I'm wondering if Mark Burnett is anywhere in the audience  I'd like to suggest a reality TV show called  Pre vivor.  If you develop a disease  you're off the island. But the problem is  we have a system that is completely    basically promoted this. We've selected  at every point in this system  to do what we do  and to give everyone a precondition and then eventually a condition  in some cases. Start with the doctor patient relationship. Doctors  most of them  are in a fee for service system. They are basically incentivized to do more    procedures  tests  prescribe medications. Patients come to them  they want to do something. We're Americans  we can't just stand there  we have to do something. And so they want a drug. They want a treatment. They want to be told  this is what you have and this is how you treat it. If the doctor doesn't give you that  you go somewhere else. That's not very good for doctors' business. Or even worse  if you are diagnosed with something eventually  and the doctor didn't order that test  you get sued. We have pharmaceutical companies that are constantly trying to expand the indications  expand the number of people who are eligible for a given treatment  because that obviously helps their bottom line. We have advocacy groups  like the one that's come up with pre vivor  who want to make more and more people feel they are at risk  or might have a condition  so that they can raise more funds and raise visibility  et cetera. But this isn't actually  despite what journalists typically do  this isn't actually about blaming particular players. We are all responsible. I'm responsible. I actually root for the Yankees  I mean talk about rooting for the worst possible offender when it comes to doing everything you can do. Thank you. But everyone is responsible. I went to medical school  and I didn't have a course called How to Think Skeptically  or How Not to Order Tests. We have this system where that's what you do. And it actually took being a journalist to understand all these incentives. You know  economists like to say  there are no bad people  there are just bad incentives. And that's actually true. Because what we've created is a sort of Field of Dreams  when it comes to medical technology. So when you put another MRI in every corner  you put a robot in every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery. Well  we've created a system where if you build it  they will come. But you can actually perversely tell people to come  convince them that they have to come. It was when I became a journalist that I really realized how I was part of this problem  and how we all are part of this problem. I was medicalizing every risk factor  I was writing stories  commissioning stories  every day  that were trying to  not necessarily make people worried  although that was what often happened. But  you know  there are ways out. I saw my own internist last week  and he said to me   You know   and he told me something that everyone in this audience could have told me for free  but I paid him for the privilege  which is that I need to lose some weight. Well  he's right. I've had honest to goodness high blood pressure for a dozen years now  same age my father got it  and it's a real disease. It's not pre hypertension  it's actual hypertension  high blood pressure. Well  he's right  but he didn't say to me  well  you have pre obesity or you have pre diabetes  or anything like that. He didn't say  better start taking this Statin  you need to lower your cholesterol. No  he said   Go out and lose some weight. Come back and see me in a bit  or just give me a call and let me know how you're doing.  So that's  to me  a way forward. Billy Beane  by the way  learned the same thing. He learned  from watching this kid who he eventually hired  who was really successful for him  that it wasn't swinging for the fences  it wasn't swinging at every pitch like the sluggers do  which is what all the expensive teams like the Yankees like to    they like to pick up those guys. This kid told him  you know  you gotta watch the guys  and you gotta go out and find the guys who like to walk  because getting on base by a walk is just as good  and in our healthcare system we need to figure out  is that really a good pitch or should we let it go by and not swing at everything  Thanks. As a magician  I'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion. And one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater  which was popular in the early part of the   th century. It used mirrors to create the illusion of tiny people performing on a miniature stage. Now  I won't use mirrors  but this is my digital tribute to the tanagra theater. So let the story begin. On a dark and stormy night    really     it was the   th of July      . Lightning lit the sky  and a baby was born. His name was Nikola  Nikola Tesla. Now the baby grew into a very smart guy. Let me show you. Tesla  what is     multiplied by      Nikola Tesla  The result is        . Marco Tempest  Now Tesla's brain worked in the most extraordinary way. When a word was mentioned  an image of it instantly appeared in his mind. Tree. Chair. Girl. They were hallucinations  which vanished the moment he touched them. Probably a form of synesthesia. But it was something he later turned to his advantage. Where other scientists would play in their laboratory  Tesla created his inventions in his mind. NT  To my delight  I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility. MT  And when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination  he would build them in his workshop. NT  I needed no models  drawings or experiments. I could picture them as real in my mind  and there I run it  test it and improve it. Only then do I construct it. MT  His great idea was alternating current. But how could he convince the public that the millions of volts required to make it work were safe  To sell his idea  he became a showman. NT  We are at the dawn of a new age  the age of electricity. I have been able  through careful invention  to transmit  with the mere flick of a switch  electricity across the ether. It is the magic of science. Tesla has over     patents to his name  radio  wireless telegraphy  remote control  robotics. He even photographed the bones of the human body. But the high point was the realization of a childhood dream  harnessing the raging powers of Niagara Falls  and bringing light to the city. But Tesla's success didn't last. NT  I had bigger ideas. Illuminating the city was only the beginning. A world telegraphy center    imagine news  messages  sounds  images delivered to any point in the world instantly and wirelessly. MT  It's a great idea  it was a huge project. Expensive  too. NT  They wouldn't give me the money. MT  Well  maybe you shouldn't have told them it could be used to contact other planets. NT  Yes  that was a big mistake. MT  Tesla's career as an inventor never recovered. He became a recluse. Dodged by death  he spent much of his time in his suite at the Waldorf Astoria. NT  Everything I did  I did for mankind  for a world where there would be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich  where products of intellect  science and art will serve society for the betterment and beautification of life. MT  Nikola Tesla died on the  th of January      . His final resting place is a golden globe that contains his ashes at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade. His legacy is with us still. Tesla became the man who lit the world  but this was only the beginning. Tesla's insight was profound. NT  Tell me  what will man do when the forests disappear  and the coal deposits are exhausted  MT  Tesla thought he had the answer. We are still asking the question. Thank you. Everyone is both a learner and a teacher. This is me being inspired by my first tutor  my mom  and this is me teaching Introduction to Artificial Intelligence to     students at Stanford University. Now the students and I enjoyed the class  but it occurred to me that while the subject matter of the class is advanced and modern  the teaching technology isn't. In fact  I use basically the same technology as this   th century classroom. Note the textbook  the sage on the stage  and the sleeping guy in the back.  Laughter  Just like today. So my co teacher  Sebastian Thrun  and I thought  there must be a better way. We challenged ourselves to create an online class that would be equal or better in quality to our Stanford class  but to bring it to anyone in the world for free. We announced the class on July   th  and within two weeks         people had signed up for it. And that grew to         students from     countries. We were thrilled to have that kind of audience  and just a bit terrified that we hadn't finished preparing the class yet.  Laughter  So we got to work. We studied what others had done  what we could copy and what we could change. Benjamin Bloom had showed that one on one tutoring works best  so that's what we tried to emulate  like with me and my mom  even though we knew it would be one on thousands. Here  an overhead video camera is recording me as I'm talking and drawing on a piece of paper. A student said   This class felt like sitting in a bar with a really smart friend who's explaining something you haven't grasped  but are about to.  And that's exactly what we were aiming for. Now  from Khan Academy  we saw that short    minute videos worked much better than trying to record an hour long lecture and put it on the small format screen. We decided to go even shorter and more interactive. Our typical video is two minutes  sometimes shorter  never more than six  and then we pause for a quiz question  to make it feel like one on one tutoring. Here  I'm explaining how a computer uses the grammar of English to parse sentences  and here  there's a pause and the student has to reflect  understand what's going on and check the right boxes before they can continue. Students learn best when they're actively practicing. We wanted to engage them  to have them grapple with ambiguity and guide them to synthesize the key ideas themselves. We mostly avoid questions like   Here's a formula  now tell me the value of Y when X is equal to two.  We preferred open ended questions. One student wrote   Now I'm seeing Bayes networks and examples of game theory everywhere I look.  And I like that kind of response. That's just what we were going for. We didn't want students to memorize the formulas  we wanted to change the way they looked at the world. And we succeeded. Or  I should say  the students succeeded. And it's a little bit ironic that we set about to disrupt traditional education  and in doing so  we ended up making our online class much more like a traditional college class than other online classes. Most online classes  the videos are always available. You can watch them any time you want. But if you can do it any time  that means you can do it tomorrow  and if you can do it tomorrow  well  you may not ever get around to it.  Laughter  So we brought back the innovation of having due dates.  Laughter  You could watch the videos any time you wanted during the week  but at the end of the week  you had to get the homework done. This motivated the students to keep going  and it also meant that everybody was working on the same thing at the same time  so if you went into a discussion forum  you could get an answer from a peer within minutes. Now  I'll show you some of the forums  most of which were self organized by the students themselves. From Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng  we learned the concept of  flipping  the classroom. Students watched the videos on their own  and then they come together to discuss them. From Eric Mazur  I learned about peer instruction  that peers can be the best teachers  because they're the ones that remember what it's like to not understand. Sebastian and I have forgotten some of that. Of course  we couldn't have a classroom discussion with tens of thousands of students  so we encouraged and nurtured these online forums. And finally  from Teach For America  I learned that a class is not primarily about information. More important is motivation and determination. It was crucial that the students see that we're working hard for them and they're all supporting each other. Now  the class ran    weeks  and in the end  about half of the         students watched at least one video each week  and over        finished all the homework  putting in    to     hours. They got this statement of accomplishment. So what have we learned  Well  we tried some old ideas and some new and put them together  but there are more ideas to try. Sebastian's teaching another class now. I'll do one in the fall. Stanford Coursera  Udacity  MITx and others have more classes coming. It's a really exciting time. But to me  the most exciting part of it is the data that we're gathering. We're gathering thousands of interactions per student per class  billions of interactions altogether  and now we can start analyzing that  and when we learn from that  do experimentations  that's when the real revolution will come. And you'll be able to see the results from a new generation of amazing students. Good evening. We are in this wonderful open air amphitheater and we are enjoying ourselves in that mild evening temperature tonight  but when Qatar will host the football World Cup    years from now        we already heard it will be in the hot  very hot and sunny summer months of June and July. And when Qatar has been assigned to the World Cup all  many people around the world have been wondering  how would it be possible that football players show spectacular football  run around in this desert climate  How would it be possible that spectators sit  enjoy themselves in open air stadia in this hot environment  Together with the architects of Albert Speer   Partner  our engineers from Transsolar have been supporting  have been developing open air stadia based on     percent solar power  on     percent solar cooling. Let me tell you about that  but let me start with comfort. Let me start with the aspect of comfort  because many people are confusing ambient temperature with thermal comfort. We are used to looking at charts like that  and you see this red line showing the air temperature in June and July  and yes  that's right  it's picking up to    degrees C. It's actually very hot. But air temperature is not the full set of climatic parameters which define comfort. Let me show you analysis a colleague of mine did looking on different football  World Cups  Olympic Games around the world  looking on the comfort and analyzing the comfort people have perceived at these different sport activities  and let me start with Mexico. Mexico temperature has been  air temperature has been something between     up to    degrees C  and people enjoyed themselves. It was a very comfortable game in Mexico City. Have a look. Orlando  same kind of stadium  open air stadium. People have been sitting in the strong sun  in the very high humidity in the afternoon  and they did not enjoy. It was not comfortable. The air temperature was not too high  but it was not comfortable during these games. What about Seoul  Seoul  because of broadcast rights  all the games have been in the late afternoon. Sun has already been set  so the games have been perceived as comfortable. What about Athens  Mediterranean climate  but in the sun it was not comfortable. They didn't perceive comfort. And we know that from Spain  we know that  sol y sombra.  If you have a ticket  and you get a ticket for the shade  you pay more  because you're in a more comfortable environment. What about Beijing  It's again  sun in the day and high humidity  and it was not comfortable. So if I overlay  and if you overlay all these comfort envelopes  what we see is  in all these places  air temperature has been ranging something from    to     and if you go on the line      of    degrees C ambient temperatures. If you go along that line you see there has been all kind of comfort  all kinds of perceived outdoor comfort  ranging from very comfortable to very uncomfortable. So why is that  This is because there are more parameters influencing our thermal comfort  which is the sun  the direct sun  the diffuse sun  which is wind  strong wind  mild wind  which is air humidity  which is the radiant temperature of the surroundings where we are in. And this is air temperature. All these parameters go into the comfort feeling of our human body  and scientists have developed a parameter  which is the perceived temperature  where all these parameters go in and help designers to understand which is the driving parameter that I feel comfort or that I don't feel comfort. Which is the driving parameter which gives me a perceived temperature  And these parameters  these climatic parameters are related to the human metabolism. Because of our metabolism  we as human beings  we produce heat. I'm excited  I'm talking to you  I'm probably producing     watts at the moment. You are sitting  you are relaxed  you're looking at me. It's probably     watts each person is producing  and we need to get rid of that energy. I need  with my body  to get rid of the energy  and the harder it is for myself  for my body  to get rid of the energy  the less comfort I feel. That's it. And if I don't get rid of the energy  I will die. If we overlay what happens during the football World Cup  what will happen in June  July  we will see  yes  air temperature will be much higher  but because the games and the plays will be in the afternoon  it's probably the same comfort rating we've found in other places which has perceived as non comfortable. So we sat together with a team which prepared the Bid Book  or goal  that we said  let's aim for perceived temperature  for outdoor comfort in this range  which is perceived with a temperature of    degrees Celsius perceived temperature  which is extremely comfortable. People would feel really fine in an open outdoor environment. But what does it mean  If we just look on what happens  we see  temperature's too high. If we apply the best architectural design  climate engineering design  we won't get much better. So we need to do something active. We need  for instance  to bring in radiant cooling technology  and we need to combine this with so called soft conditioning. And how does it look like in a stadium  So the stadium has a few elements which create that outdoor comfort. First of all  it's shading. It needs to protect where the people are sitting against strong and warm wind. But that's not all what we need to do. We need to use active systems. Instead of blowing a hurricane of chilled air through the stadium  we can use radiant cooling technologies  like a floor heating system where water pipes are embedded in the floor. And just by using cold water going through the water pipes  you can release the heat which is absorbed during the day in the stadium  so you can create that comfort  and then by adding dry air instead of down chilled air  the spectators and the football players can adjust to their individual comfort needs  to their individual energy balance. They can adjust and find their comfort they need to find. There are    stadia probably to come  but there are    training pitches where all the individual countries are going to train. We applied the same concept  shading of the training pitch  using a shelter against wind  then using the grass. Natural watered lawn is a very good cooling source stabilizing temperature  and using dehumidified air to create comfort. But even the best passive design wouldn't help. We need active system. And how do we do that  Our idea for the bid was     percent solar cooling  based on the idea that we use the roof of the stadia  we cover the roofs of the stadia with PV systems. We don't borrow any energy from history. We are not using fossil energies. We are not borrowing energy from our neighbors. We're using energy we can harvest on our roofs  and also on the training pitches  which will be covered with large  flexible membranes  and we will see in the next years an industry coming up with flexible photovoltaics  giving the possibilities of shading against strong sun and producing electric energy in the same time. And this energy now is harvested throughout the year  sent into the grid  is replacing fossils in the grid  and when I need it for the cooling  I take it back from the grid and I use the solar energy which I have brought to the grid back when I need it for the solar cooling. And I can do that in the first year and I can balance that in the next     and the next    years  this energy  which is necessary to condition a World Cup in Qatar  the next    years  this energy goes into the grid of Qatar. So this     Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  This is not only useful for stadia. We can use that also in open air places and streets  and we've been working on the City of the Future in Masdar  which is in the United Emirates  Abu Dhabi. And I had the pleasure to work on the central plaza. And the same idea to use there  to create outdoor conditions which are perceived as comfortable. People enjoy going there instead of going into a shopping mall  which is chilled down and which is cooled. We wanted to create an outdoor space which is so comfortable that people can go there in the early afternoon  even in these sunny and hot summer months  and they can enjoy and meet there with their families.  Applause  And the same concept  shade against the sun  shade against the wind  and use  use and take advantage of the sun you can harvest on your footprint. And these beautiful umbrellas. So I'd like to encourage you to pay attention to your thermal comfort  to your thermal environment  tonight and tomorrow  and if you'd like to learn more about that  I invite you to go to our website. We uploaded a very simple perceived temperature calculator where you can check out about your outdoor comfort. And I also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different climatic parameters  it will be possible to create really good and comfortable outdoor conditions  to change our thermal perception that we feel comfortable in an outdoor environment  and we can do that with the best passive design  but also using the energy source of the site in Qatar which is the sun. Thank you very much.  Applause  Shukran.  Applause  As a kid  I was fascinated with all things air and space. I would watch Nova on PBS. Our school would show Bill Nye the Science Guy. When I was in elementary school  my next door neighbor  he gave me a book for my birthday. It was an astronomy book  and I poured over that thing for hours on end  and it was a combination of all these things that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream  and part of that dream was  I always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft. Well  a number of years later  I graduated from UCLA and I found myself at NASA  working for the jet propulsion laboratory  and there our team was challenged to create a  D visualization of the solar system  and today I want to show you what we've done so far. Now  the kicker is  everything I'm about to do here you can do at home  because we built this for the public for you guys to use. So what you're looking at right now is the Earth. You can see the United States and California and San Diego  and you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around. Now  this isn't new. Anyone who's used Google Earth has seen this before  but one thing we like to say in our group is  we do the opposite of Google Earth. Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard. We go from this view out to the stars. So the Earth is cool  but what we really want to show are the spacecraft  so I'm going to bring the interface back up  and now you're looking at a number of satellites orbiting the Earth. These are a number of our science space Earth orbiters. We haven't included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites. If we did  it would be a complete mess  because there's a lot of stuff out there. And the cool thing is  we actually created  D models for a number of these spacecraft  so if you want to visit any of these  all you need to do is double click on them. So I'm going to find the International Space Station  double click  and it will take us all the way down to the ISS. And now you're riding along with the ISS where it is right now. And the other cool thing is  not only can we move the camera around  we can also control time  so I can slide this jog dial here to shuttle time forward  and now we can see what a sunset on the ISS would look like  and they get one every    minutes.  Laughter  All right  so what about the rest of it  Well  I can click on this home button over here  and that will take us up to the inner solar system  and now we're looking at the rest of the solar system. You can see  there's Saturn  there's Jupiter  and while we're here  I want to point out something. It's actually pretty busy. Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory on its way to Mars  just launched last weekend. Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter  there. We have Dawn orbiting Vesta  and we have over here New Horizons on a straight shot to Pluto. And I mention this because there's this strange public perception that NASA's dead  that the space shuttles stopped flying and all of the sudden there's no more spacecraft out there. Well  a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration  and we have a lot of spacecraft out there. Granted  we're not sending humans up at the moment  well at least with our own launch vehicles  but NASA is far from dead  and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there's so many other things that we're doing. Anyway  while we're here  again  if you want to visit anything  all you need to do is double click. So I'm just going to double click on Vesta  and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta  and this is happening right now. I'm going to double click on Uranus  and we can see Uranus rotating on its side along with its moons. You can see how it's tilted at about    degrees. And just being able to visit different places and go through different times  we have data from      to     . Granted  we don't have everything in between  because some of the data is hard to get. Just being able to visit places in different times  you can explore this for hours  literally hours on end  but I want to show you one thing in particular  so I'm going to open up the destination tab  spacecraft outer planet missions  Voyager    and I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby. So now we've gone back in time. We're now riding along with Voyager  . The date here is November         . Now  there's a funny thing going on here. It doesn't look like anything's going on. It looks like I've paused the program. It's actually running at real rate right now  one second per second  and in fact  Voyager   here is flying by Titan at I think it's        miles per hour. It only looks like nothing's moving because  well  Saturn here is         miles away  and Titan here is       to       miles away. It's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing's happening. But to make it more interesting  I'm going to speed up time  and we can watch as Voyager   flies by Titan  which is a hazy moon of Saturn. It actually has a very thick atmosphere. And I'm going to recenter the camera on Saturn  here. I'm going to pull out  and I want to show you Voyager   as it flies by Saturn. There's a point to be made here. With a  D visualization like this  we can not only just say Voyager   flew by Saturn. There's a whole story to tell here. And even better  because it's an interactive application  you can tell the story for yourself. If you want to pause it  you can pause it. If you want to keep going  if you want to change the camera angle  you can do that  and because of that  I can show you that Voyager   doesn't just fly by Saturn. It actually flies underneath Saturn. Now  what happens is  as it flies underneath Saturn  Saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up and out of the solar system  so if I just keep letting this go  you can see Voyager   fly up like that. And  in fact  I'm going to go back to the solar system. I'm going to go back to today  now  and I want to show you where Voyager   is. Right there  above  way above the solar system  way beyond our solar system. And here's the thing. Now you know how it got there. Now you know why  and to me  that's the point of this program. You can manipulate it yourself. You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself. You know  the theme today is  The World In Your Grasp.  Well  we're trying to give you the solar system in your grasp    Laughter    and we hope once it's there  you'll be able to learn for yourself what we've done out there  and what we're about to do. And my personal dream is for kids to take this and explore and see the wonders out there and be inspired  as I was as a kid  to pursue STEM education and to pursue a dream in space exploration. Thank you.  Applause  Over the last two decades  India has become a global hub for software development and offshoring of back office services  as we call it  and what we were interested in finding out was that because of this huge industry that has started over the last two decades in India  offshoring software development and back office services  there's been a flight of white collar jobs from the developed world to India. When this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to China  it has  you know  led to considerable angst amongst the Western populations. In fact  if you look at polls  they show a declining trend for support for free trade in the West. Now  the Western elites  however  have said this fear is misplaced. For example  if you have read   I suspect many of you have done so   read the book by Thomas Friedman called  The World Is Flat   he said  basically  in his book that  you know  this fear for free trade is wrong because it assumes  it's based on a mistaken assumption that everything that can be invented has been invented. In fact  he says  it's innovation that will keep the West ahead of the developing world  with the more sophisticated  innovative tasks being done in the developed world  and the less sophisticated  shall we say  drudge work being done in the developing world. Now  what we were trying to understand was  is this true  Could India become a source  or a global hub  of innovation  just like it's become a global hub for back office services and software development  And for the last four years  my coauthor Phanish Puranam and I spent investigating this topic. Initially  or  you know  as people would say  you know  in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting the Western innovative model  say   Where are the Indian Googles  iPods and Viagras  if the Indians are so bloody smart    Laughter  So initially  when we started our research  we went and met several executives  and we asked them   What do you think  Will India go from being a favored destination for software services and back office services to a destination for innovation   They laughed. They dismissed us. They said   You know what  Indians don't do innovation.  The more polite ones said   Well  you know  Indians make good software programmers and accountants  but they can't do the creative stuff.  Sometimes  it took a more  took a veneer of sophistication  and people said   You know  it's nothing to do with Indians. It's really the rule based  regimented education system in India that is responsible for killing all creativity.  They said  instead  if you want to see real creativity  go to Silicon Valley  and look at companies like Google  Microsoft  Intel. So we started examining the R amp D and innovation labs of Silicon Valley. Well  interestingly  what you find there is  usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab or the R amp D center as they may call it  and more often than not  it's an Indian.  Laughter  So I immediately said   Well  but you could not have been educated in India  right  You must have gotten your education here.  It turned out  in every single case  they came out of the Indian educational system. So we realized that maybe we had the wrong question  and the right question is  really  can Indians based out of India do innovative work  So off we went to India. We made  I think  about a dozen trips to Bangalore  Mumbai  Gurgaon  Delhi  Hyderabad  you name it  to examine what is the level of corporate innovation in these cities. And what we found was  as we progressed in our research  was  that we were asking really the wrong question. When you ask   Where are the Indian Googles  iPods and Viagras   you are taking a particular perspective on innovation  which is innovation for end users  visible innovation. Instead  innovation  if you remember  some of you may have read the famous economist Schumpeter  he said   Innovation is novelty in how value is created and distributed.  It could be new products and services  but it could also be new ways of producing products. It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries. Once you take this  there's no reason to restrict innovation  the beneficiaries of innovation  just to end users. When you take this broader conceptualization of innovation  what we found was  India is well represented in innovation  but the innovation that is being done in India is of a form we did not anticipate  and what we did was we called it  invisible innovation.  And specifically  there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of India. The first type of invisible innovation out of India is what we call innovation for business customers  which is led by the multinational corporations  which have    in the last two decades  there have been     R amp D centers set up in India by multinational companies employing more than         professionals. Now  when you consider the fact that  historically  the R amp D center of a multinational company was always in the headquarters  or in the country of origin of that multinational company  to have     R amp D centers of multinational corporations in India is truly a remarkable figure. When we went and talked to the people in those innovation centers and asked them what are they working on  they said   We are working on global products.  They were not working on localizing global products for India  which is the usual role of a local R amp D. They were working on truly global products  and companies like Microsoft  Google  AstraZeneca  General Electric  Philips  have already answered in the affirmative the question that from their Bangalore and Hyderabad R amp D centers they are able to produce products and services for the world. But of course  as an end user  you don't see that  because you only see the name of the company  not where it was developed. The other thing we were told then was   Yes  but  you know  the kind of work that is coming out of the Indian R amp D center cannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out of the U.S. R amp D centers.  So my coauthor Phanish Puranam  who happens to be one of the smartest people I know  said he's going to do a study. What he did was he looked at those companies that had an R amp D center in USA and in India  and then he looked at a patent that was filed out of the U.S. and a similar patent filed out of the same company's subsidiary in India  so he's now comparing the patents of R amp D centers in the U.S. with R amp D centers in India of the same company to find out what is the quality of the patents filed out of the Indian centers and how do they compare with the quality of the patents filed out of the U.S. centers  Interestingly  what he finds is   and by the way  the way we look at the quality of a patent is what we call forward citations  How many times does a future patent reference the older patent    he finds something very interesting. What we find is that the data says that the number of forward citations of a patent filed out of a U.S. R amp D subsidiary is identical to the number of forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiary of the same company within that company. So within the company  there's no difference in the forward citation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus their U.S. subsidiaries. So that's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India. The second kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call outsourcing innovation to Indian companies  where many companies today are contracting Indian companies to do a major part of their product development work for their global products which are going to be sold to the entire world. For example  in the pharma industry  a lot of the molecules are being developed  but you see a major part of that work is being sent to India. For example  XCL Technologies  they developed two of the mission critical systems for the new Boeing     Dreamliner  one to avoid collisions in the sky  and another to allow landing in zero visibility. But of course  when you climb onto the Boeing      you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation out of India. The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call process innovations  because of an injection of intelligence by Indian firms. Process innovation is different from product innovation. It's about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product  but not a new product itself  Only in India do millions of young people dream of working in a call center. What happens   You know  it's a dead end job in the West  what high school dropouts do. What happens when you put hundreds of thousands of smart  young  ambitious kids on a call center job  Very quickly  they get bored  and they start innovating  and they start telling the boss how to do this job better  and out of this process innovation comes product innovations  which are then marketed around the world. For example       Customer  traditional call center company  used to be a traditional call center company. Today they're developing analytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before you pick up the phone  you can guess or predict what this phone call is about. It's because of an injection of intelligence into a process which was considered dead for a long time in the West. And the last kind of innovation  invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call management innovation. It's not a new product or a new process but a new way to organize work  and the most significant management innovation to come out of India  invented by the Indian offshoring industry is what we call the global delivery model. What the global delivery model allows is  it allows you to take previously geographically core located tasks  break them up into parts  send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists  and then specify the means for reintegrating them. Without that  you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today. So  what I'm trying to say is  what we are finding in our research is  that if products for end users is the visible tip of the innovation iceberg  India is well represented in the invisible  large  submerged portion of the innovation iceberg. Now  this has  of course  some implications  and so we developed three implications of this research. The first is what we called sinking skill ladder  and now I'm going to go back to where I started my conversation with you  which was about the flight of jobs. Now  of course  when we first  as a multinational company  decide to outsource jobs to India in the R amp D  what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to India  the least sophisticated jobs  just like Tom Friedman would predict. Now  what happens is  when you outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to India for innovation and for R amp D work  at some stage in the very near future you are going to have to confront a problem  which is where does the next step of the ladder people come from within your company  So you have two choices then  Either you bring the people from India into the developed world to take positions in the next step of the ladder   immigration   or you say  there's so many people in the bottom step of the ladder waiting to take the next position in India  why don't we move the next step to India  What we are trying to say is that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder  you    it's a self perpetuating act  because of the sinking skill ladder  and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that you can't be an investment banker without having been an analyst once. You can't be a professor without having been a student. You can't be a consultant without having been a research associate. So  if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs  at some stage  the next step of the ladder has to follow. The second thing we bring up is what we call the browning of the TMT  the top management teams. If the R amp D talent is going to be based out of India and China  and the largest growth markets are going to be based out of India and China  you have to confront the problem that your top management of the future is going to have to come out of India and China  because that's where the product leadership is  that's where the important market leadership is. Right  And the last thing we point out in this slide  which is  you know  that to this story  there's one caveat. India has the youngest growing population in the world. This demographic dividend is incredible  but paradoxically  there's also the mirage of mighty labor pools. Indian institutes and educational system  with a few exceptions  are incapable of producing students in the quantity and quality needed to keep this innovation engine going  so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this  but in the end it does not absolve the government of the responsibility for creating this educational structure. So finally  I want to conclude by showing you the profile of one company  IBM. As many of you know  IBM has always been considered for the last hundred years to be one of the most innovative companies. In fact  if you look at the number of patents filed over history  I think they are in the top or the top two or three companies in the world of all patents filed in the USA as a private company. Here is the profile of employees of IBM over the last decade. In       they had         employees  or         employees  out of which          were in America        were in India. In       they had         employees  by which time the U.S. employees had moved to          whereas the Indian employees had gone to        . Well  in       they decided they're not going to reveal this data anymore  so I had to make some estimates based on various sources. Here are my best guesses. Okay  I'm not saying this is the exact number  it's my best guess. It gives you a sense of the trend. There are         people now at IBM  out of which        are remaining in the U.S.  and         are in India. So you tell me  is IBM an American company  or an Indian company   Laughter  Ladies and gentlemen  thank you very much.  Applause  What I'm going to do is to just give a few notes  and this is from a book I'm preparing called  Letters to a Young Scientist.  I'd thought it'd be appropriate to present it  on the basis that I have had extensive experience in teaching  counseling scientists across a broad array of fields. And you might like to hear some of the principles that I've developed in doing that teaching and counseling. So let me begin by urging you  particularly you on the youngsters' side  on this path you've chosen  to go as far as you can. The world needs you  badly. Humanity is now fully into the techno scientific age. There is going to be no turning back. Although varying among disciplines    say  astrophysics  molecular genetics  the immunology  the microbiology  the public health  to the new area of the human body as a symbiont  to public health  environmental science. Knowledge in medical science and science overall is doubling every    to    years. Technology is increasing at a comparable rate. Between them  the two already pervade  as most of you here seated realize  every dimension of human life. So swift is the velocity of the techno scientific revolution  so startling in its countless twists and turns  that no one can predict its outcome even a decade from the present moment. There will come a time  of course  when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge  which actually began in the     s  has to peak and level off  but that's not going to matter to you. The revolution is going to continue for at least several more decades. It'll render the human condition radically different from what it is today. Traditional fields of study are going to continue to grow and in so doing  inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines. In time  all of science will come to be a continuum of description  an explanation of networks  of principles and laws. That's why you need not just be training in one specialty  but also acquire breadth in other fields  related to and even distant from your own initial choice. Keep your eyes lifted and your head turning. The search for knowledge is in our genes. It was put there by our distant ancestors who spread across the world  and it's never going to be quenched. To understand and use it sanely  as a part of the civilization yet to evolve requires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people like you. In education  medicine  law  diplomacy  government  business and the media that exist today. Our political leaders need at least a modest degree of scientific literacy  which most badly lack today    no applause  please. It will be better for all if they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job. Therefore you will do well to act on the side  no matter how far into the laboratory you may go  to serve as teachers during the span of your career. I'll now proceed quickly  and before else  to a subject that is both a vital asset and a potential barrier to a scientific career. If you are a bit short in mathematical skills  don't worry. Many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathematically semi literate. A metaphor will serve here  Where elite mathematicians and statisticians and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm of science  the remaining large majority of basic applied scientists  including a large portion of those who could be said to be of the first rank  are the ones who map the terrain  they scout the frontiers  they cut the pathways  they raise the buildings along the way. Some may have considered me foolhardy  but it's been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics when talking to candidate scientists. During    years of teaching biology at Harvard  I watched sadly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non required courses in science because they were afraid of failure. These math phobes deprive science and medicine of immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent. Here's how to relax your anxieties  if you have them  Understand that mathematics is a language ruled like other verbal languages  or like verbal language generally  by its own grammar and system of logic. Any person with average quantitative intelligence who learns to read and write mathematics at an elementary level will  as in verbal language  have little difficulty picking up most of the fundamentals if they choose to master the mathspeak of most disciplines of science. The longer you wait to become at least semi literate the harder the language of mathematics will be to master  just as again in any verbal language  but it can be done at any age. I speak as an authority on that subject  because I'm an extreme case. I didn't take algebra until my freshman year at the University of Alabama. They didn't teach it before then. I finally got around to calculus as a    year old tenured professor at Harvard  where I sat uncomfortably in classes with undergraduate students  little more than half my age. A couple of them were students in a course I was giving on evolutionary biology. I swallowed my pride  and I learned calculus. I found out that in science and all its applications  what is crucial is not that technical ability  but it is imagination in all of its applications. The ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes pictured by intuition. I found out that advances in science rarely come upstream from an ability to stand at a blackboard and conjure images from unfolding mathematical propositions and equations. They are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work  during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant. Ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied for its own sake. Of foremost importance is a thorough  well organized knowledge of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain you propose to enter. When something new is discovered  it's logical then that one of the follow up steps is to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward. If that step proves too difficult for the person or team that made the discovery  a mathematician can then be added by them as a collaborator. Consider the following principle  which I will modestly call Wilson's Principle Number One  It is far easier for scientists including medical researchers  to require needed collaboration in mathematics and statistics than it is for mathematicians and statisticians to find scientists able to make use of their equations. It is important in choosing the direction to take in science to find the subject at your level of competence that interests you deeply  and focus on that. Keep in mind  then  Wilson's Second Principle  For every scientist  whether researcher  technician  teacher  manager or businessman  working at any level of mathematical competence  there exists a discipline in science or medicine for which that level is enough to achieve excellence. Now I'm going to offer quickly several more principles that will be useful in organizing your education and career  or if you're teaching  how you might enhance your own teaching and counseling of young scientists. In selecting a subject in which to conduct original research  or to develop world class expertise  take a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited. Judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand. This is not to de emphasize the essential requirement of broad training  or the value of apprenticing yourself in ongoing research to programs of high quality. It is important also to acquire older mentors within these successful programs  and to make friends and colleagues of your age for mutual support. But through it all  look for a way to break out  to find a field and subject not yet popular. We have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine. There is the quickest way advances are likely to occur  as measured in discoveries per investigator per year. You may have heard the military dictum for the gathering of armies  March to the sound of the guns. In science  the exact opposite is the case  March away from the sound of the guns. So Wilson's Principle Number Three  March away from the sound of the guns. Observe from a distance  but do not join the fray. Make a fray of your own. Once you have settled on a specialty  and the profession you can love  and you've secured opportunity  your potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it enough to become an expert. There are thousands of professionally delimited subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry to biology and medicine. And on then into the social sciences  where it is possible in short time to acquire the status of an authority. When the subject is still very thinly populated  you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority. The world needs this kind of expertise  and it rewards the kind of people willing to acquire it. The existing information and what you self discover may at first seem skimpy and difficult to connect to other bodies of knowledge. Well  if that's the case  good. Why hard instead of easy  The answer deserves to be stated as Principle Number Four. In the attempt to make scientific discoveries  every problem is an opportunity  and the more difficult the problem  the greater will be the importance of its solution. Now this brings me to a basic categorization in the way scientific discoveries are made. Scientists  pure mathematicians among them  follow one or the other of two pathways  First through early discoveries  a problem is identified and a solution is sought. The problem may be relatively small  for example  where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread  Or larger  what's the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe  As the answer is sought  other phenomena are typically discovered and other questions are asked. This first of the two strategies is like a hunter  exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry  who finds other quarries along the way. The second strategy of research is to study a subject broadly searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena like a hunter in what we call  the naturalist's trance   the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting  any quarry worth taking. The search is not for the solution of the problem  but for problems themselves worth solving. The two strategies of research  original research  can be stated as follows  in the final principle I'm going to offer you  For every problem in a given discipline of science  there exists a species or entity or phenomenon ideal for its solution. And conversely  for every species or other entity or phenomenon  there exist important problems for the solution of which  those particular objects of research are ideally suited. Find out what they are. You'll find your own way to discover  to learn  to teach. The decades ahead will see dramatic advances in disease prevention  general health  the quality of life. All of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science behind it you will master. You have chosen a calling that will come in steps to give you satisfaction  at its conclusion  of a life well lived. And I thank you for having me here tonight. Oh  thank you. Thank you very much. I salute you. So  last month  the Encyclopaedia Britannica announced that it is going out of print after     years  which made me nostalgic  because I remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library back when I was a kid  maybe    years old. And I wondered if I could update that game  not just for modern methods  but for the modern me. So I tried. I went to an online encyclopedia  Wikipedia  and I entered the term  Earth.  You can start anywhere  this time I chose Earth. And the first rule of the game is pretty simple. You just have to read the article until you find something you don't know  and preferably something your dad doesn't even know. And in this case  I quickly found this  The furthest point from the center of the Earth is not the tip of Mount Everest  like I might have thought  it's the tip of this mountain  Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador. The Earth spins  of course  as it travels around the sun  so the Earth bulges a little bit around the middle  like some Earthlings. And even though Mount Chimborazo isn't the tallest mountain in the Andes  it's one degree away from the equator  it's riding that bulge  and so the summit of Chimborazo is the farthest point on Earth from the center of the Earth. And it is really fun to say. So I immediately decided  this is going to be the name of the game  or my new exclamation. You can use it at TED. Chimborazo  right  It's like  eureka  and  bingo  had a baby. I didn't know that  that's pretty cool. Chimborazo  So the next rule of the game is also pretty simple. You just have to find another term and look that up. Now in the old days  that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically  maybe getting sidetracked  that was fun. Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from. I can go literally anywhere in the world  I think since I was already in Ecuador  I just decided to click on the word  tropical.  That took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics that encircles the Earth. Now that's the Tropic of Cancer in the north and the Tropic of Capricorn in the south  that much I knew  but I was surprised to learn this little fact  Those are not cartographers' lines  like latitude or the borders between nations  they are astronomical phenomena caused by the Earth's tilt  and they change. They move  they go up  they go down. In fact  for years  the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn have been steadily drifting towards the equator at the rate of about    meters per year  and nobody told me that. I didn't know it. Chimborazo  So to keep the game going  I just have to find another term and look that one up. Since I'm already in the tropics  I chose  Tropical rainforest.  Famous for its diversity  human diversity. There are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet. They're all over the globe  but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests. This is the only place you can go nowadays and not get  friended.  The link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end. It mentioned leopards and ring tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then coleoptera  which turn out to be beetles. Now I clicked on this on purpose  but if I'd somehow gotten here by mistake  it does remind me  for the band  see  The Beatles   for the car see  Volkswagon Beetle   but I am here for beetle beetles. This is the most successful order on the planet by far. Something between    and    percent of all life forms on the planet  including plants  are beetles. That means the next time you are in the grocery store  take a look at the four people ahead of you in line. Statistically  one of you is a beetle. And if it is you  you are astonishingly well adapted. There are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums. There are predator beetles  that attack other insects and still look pretty cute to us. There are beetles that roll little balls of dung great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings. This reminded the ancient Egyptians of their god Khepri  who renews the ball of the sun every morning  which is how that dung rolling scarab became that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun. Beetles  I was reminded  have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom. Fireflies are not flies  fireflies are beetles. Fireflies are coleoptera  and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well. Like my next link  The chemical language of pheromones. Now the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex. Yeah. And the link to aphrodisiac. Now that's something that increases sexual desire  possibly chocolate. There is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine that might be an aphrodisiac. But as the article mentions  because of enzyme breakdown  it's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally. So those of you who only eat your chocolate  you might have to experiment. The link I clicked on here   sympathetic magic   mostly because I understand what both of those words mean. But not when they're together like that. I do like sympathy. I do like magic. So when I click on  sympathetic magic   I get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls. This is the boy in me getting lucky again. Sympathetic magic is imitation. If you imitate something  maybe you can have an effect on it. That's the idea behind voodoo dolls  and possibly also cave paintings. The link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind. I would love to see Google maps inside some of these caves. We've got tens of thousands years old artwork. Common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands  usually the left hand. We have been a dominantly right handed tribe for millenia  so even though I don't know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand or blow pigment on it from a tube  I can easily picture how he did it. And I really don't think it's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar right there that I'm going to use now to click on the term for  hand   go to the page for  hand   where I found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia I've found in a long time. It's simply this  The back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar. Now that's embarrassing  because up until now  every time I've said   I know it like the back of my hand   I've really been saying   I'm totally familiar with that  I just don't know it's freaking name  right   And the link I clicked on here  well  lemurs  monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar. I click on chimpanzee  and I get our closest genetic relative. Pan troglodytes  the name we give him  means  cave dweller.  He doesn't. He lives in rainforests and savannas. It's just that we're always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us  evolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us  and in some cases  he gets places before us. Like my next link  the almost irresistible link  Ham the Astrochimp. I click on him  and I really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice  in fact. He's born in Cameroon  which is smack in the middle of my tropics map  and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the Smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles. In between those two landmarks in Ham's life  he flew into space. He experienced weightlessness and re entry months before the first human being to do it  Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. When I click on Yuri Gagarin's page  I get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature  huge in heroism. Top estimates  Soviet estimates  put this guy at  .   meters  that is less than five and a half feet tall max  possibly because he was malnourished as a child. Germans occupied Russia. A Nazi officer took over the Gagarin household  and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut. Years later  the boy from that cramped mud hut would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule on the tip of a rocket who volunteered to be launched into outer space  the first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet. And he didn't just leave it  he circled it once. Fifty years later  as a tribute  the International Space Station  which is still up there tonight  synced its orbit with Gagarin's orbit  at the exact same time of day  and filmed it  so you can go online and you can watch over     minutes of what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride  possibly a lonely one  the first person to ever see such a thing. And then when you've had your fill of that  you can click on one more link. You can come back to Earth. You return to where you started. You can finish your game. You just need to find one more fact that you didn't know. And for me  I quickly landed on this one  The Earth has a tolerance of about .   percent from the reference spheroid  which is less than the .   percent allowed in billiard balls. This is the kind of fact I would have loved as a boy. I found it myself. It's got some math that I can do. I'm pretty sure my dad doesn't know it. What this means is that if you could shrink the Earth to the size of a billiard ball  if you could take planet Earth  with all its mountain tops and caves and rainforests  astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees  voodoo dolls  fireflies  chocolate  sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea  you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball  it would be as smooth as a billiard ball  presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle. That's pretty cool. I didn't know that. Chimborazo  Thank you. So a few weeks ago  a friend of mine gave this toy car to his   year old son. But instead of going into a store and buying one  like we do normally  he went to this website and he downloaded a file  and then he printed it on this printer. So this idea that you can manufacture objects digitally using these machines is something that The Economist magazine defined as the Third Industrial Revolution. Actually  I argue that there is another revolution going on  and it's the one that has to do with open source hardware and the maker's movement  because the printer that my friend used to print the toy is actually open source. So you go to the same website  you can download all the files that you need in order to make that printer  the construction files  the hardware  the software  all the instruction is there. And also this is part of a large community where there are thousands of people around the world that are actually making these kinds of printers  and there's a lot of innovation happening because it's all open source. You don't need anybody's permission to create something great. And that space is like the personal computer in       like the Apples with the other companies are fighting  and we will see in a few years  there will be the Apple of this kind of market come out. Well  there's also another interesting thing. I said the electronics are open source  because at the heart of this printer there is something I'm really attached to  these Arduino boards  the motherboard that sort of powers this printer  is a project I've been working on for the past seven years. It's an open source project. I worked with these friends of mine that I have here. So the five of us  two Americans  two Italians and a Spaniard  we    Laughter  You know  it's a worldwide project.  Laughter  So we came together in this design institute called the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea  which was teaching interaction design  this idea that you can take design from the simple shape of an object and you can move it forward to design the way you interact with things. Well  when you design an object that's supposed to interact with a human being  if you make a foam model of a mobile phone  it doesn't make any sense. You have to have something that actually interacts with people. So  we worked on Arduino and a lot of other projects there to create platforms that would be simple for our students to use  so that our students could just build things that worked  but they don't have five years to become an electronics engineer. We have one month. So how do I make something that even a kid can use  And actually  with Arduino  we have kids like Sylvia that you see here  that actually make projects with Arduino. I have    year old kids stop me and show me stuff they built for Arduino that's really scary to see the capabilities that kids have when you give them the tools. So let's look at what happens when you make a tool that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly  so one of the examples that I like to sort of kick off this discussion is this example of this cat feeder. The gentleman who made this project had two cats. One was sick and the other one was healthy  so he had to make sure they ate the proper food. So he made this thing that recognizes the cat from a chip mounted inside on the collar of the cat  and opens the door and the cat can eat the food. This is made by recycling an old CD player that you can get from an old computer  some cardboard  tape  couple of sensors  a few blinking LEDs  and then suddenly you have a tool. You build something that you cannot find on the market. And I like this phrase   Scratch your own itch.  If you have an idea  you just go and you make it. This is the equivalent of sketching on paper done with electronics. So one of the features that I think is important about our work is that our hardware  on top of being made with love in Italy   as you can see from the back of the circuit    Laughter  is that it's open  so we publish all the design files for the circuit online  so you can download it and you can actually use it to make something  or to modify  to learn. You know  when I was learning about programming  I learned by looking at other people's code  or looking at other people's circuits in magazines. And this is a good way to learn  by looking at other people's work. So the different elements of the project are all open  so the hardware is released with a Creative Commons license. So  you know  I like this idea that hardware becomes like a piece of culture that you share and you build upon  like it was a song or a poem with Creative Commons. Or  the software is GPL  so it's open source as well. The documentation and the hands on teaching methodology is also open source and released as the Creative Commons. Just the name is protected so that we can make sure that we can tell people what is Arduino and what isn't. Now  Arduino itself is made of a lot of different open source components that maybe individually are hard to use for a    year old kid  so Arduino wraps everything together into a mashup of open source technologies where we try to give them the best user experience to get something done quickly. So you have situations like this  where some people in Chile decided to make their own boards instead of buying them  to organize a workshop and to save money. Or there are companies that make their own variations of Arduino that fit in a certain market  and there's probably  maybe like a     of them or something at the moment. This one is made by a company called Adafruit  which is run by this woman called Limor Fried  also known as Ladyada  who is one of the heroes of the open source hardware movement and the maker movement. So  this idea that you have a new  sort of turbo charged DIY community that believes in open source  in collaboration  collaborates online  collaborates in different spaces. There is this magazine called Make that sort of gathered all these people and sort of put them together as a community  and you see a very technical project explained in a very simple language  beautifully typeset. Or you have websites  like this one  like Instructables  where people actually teach each other about anything. So this one is about Arduino projects  the page you see on the screen  but effectively here you can learn how to make a cake and everything else. So let's look at some projects. So this one is a quadcopter. It's a small model helicopter. In a way  it's a toy  no  And so this one was military technology a few years ago  and now it's open source  easy to use  you can buy it online. DIY Drones is the community  they do this thing called ArduCopter. But then somebody actually launched this start up called Matternet  where they figured out that you could use this to actually transport things from one village to another in Africa  and the fact that this was easy to find  open source  easy to hack  enabled them to prototype their company really quickly. Or  other projects. Matt Richardson  I'm getting a little sick of hearing about the same people on TV over and over and over again  so I decided to do something about it. This Arduino project  which I call the Enough Already  will mute the TV anytime any of these over exposed personalities is mentioned.  Laughter  I'll show you how I made it.  Applause  MB  Check this out. MR  Our producers caught up with Kim Kardashian earlier today to find out what she was planning on wearing to her   MB  Eh   Laughter  MR  It should do a pretty good job of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details of Kim Kardashian's wedding. MB  Okay. So  you know  again  what is interesting here is that Matt found this module that lets Arduino process TV signals  he found some code written by somebody else that generates infrared signals for the TV  put it together and then created this great project. It's also used  Arduino's used  in serious places like  you know  the Large Hadron Collider. There's some Arduino balls collecting data and sort of measuring some parameters. Or it's used for   So this is a musical interface built by a student from Italy  and he's now turning this into a product. Because it was a student project becoming a product. Or it can be used to make an assistive device. This is a glove that understands the sign language and transforms the gestures you make into sounds and writes the words that you're signing on a display And again  this is made of all different parts you can find on all the websites that sell Arduino compatible parts  and you assemble it into a project. Or this is a project from the ITP part of NYU  where they met with this boy who has a severe disability  cannot play with the PS   so they built this device that allows the kid to play baseball although he has limited movement capability. Or you can find it in arts projects. So this is the txtBomber. So you put a message into this device and then you roll it on the wall  and it basically has all these solenoids pressing the buttons on spray cans  so you just pull it over a wall and it just writes on the wall all the political messages. So  yeah.  Applause  Then we have this plant here. This is called Botanicalls  because there's an Arduino ball with a Wi Fi module in the plant  and it's measuring the well being of the plant  and it's creating a Twitter account where you can actually interact with the plant.  Laughter  So  you know  this plant will start to say   This is really hot   or there's a lot of  you know   I need water right now.   Laughter  So it just gives a personality to your plant. Or this is something that twitters when the baby inside the belly of a pregnant woman kicks.  Laughter  Or this is a    year old kid in Chile who made a system that detects earthquakes and publishes on Twitter. He has         followers. He's    and he anticipated a governmental project by one year.  Applause  Or again  another project where  by analyzing the Twitter feed of a family  you can basically point where they are  like in the  Harry Potter  movie. So you can find out everything about this project on the website. Or somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts.  Laughter  It's interesting how  in       Gizmodo basically defined  said that this project actually gives a meaning to Twitter  so it was   a lot changed in between.  Laughter  So very serious project. When the Fukushima disaster happened  a bunch of people in Japan  they realized that the information that the government was giving wasn't really open and really reliable  so they built this Geiger counter  plus Arduino  plus network interface. They made     of them and gave them to people around Japan  and essentially the data that they gathered gets published on this website called Cosm  another website they built  so you can actually get reliable real time information from the field  and you can get unbiased information. Or this machine here  it's from the DIY bio movement  and it's one of the steps that you need in order to process DNA  and again  it's completely open source from the ground up. Or you have students in developing countries making replicas of scientific instruments that cost a lot of money to make. Actually they just build them themselves for a lot less using Arduino and a few parts. This is a pH probe. Or you get kids  like these kids  they're from Spain. They learned how to program and to make robots when they were probably  like      and then they started to use Arduino to make these robots that play football. They became world champions by making an Arduino based robot. And so when we had to make our own educational robot  we just went to them and said  you know   You design it  because you know exactly what is needed to make a great robot that excites kids.  Not me. I'm an old guy. What am I supposed to excite  huh   Laughter  But as I   in terms of educational assets.  Laughter  There's also companies like Google that are using the technology to create interfaces between mobile phones  tablets and the real world. So the Accessory Development Kit from Google is open source and based on Arduino  as opposed to the one from Apple which is closed source  NDA  sign your life to Apple. Here you are. There's a giant maze  and Joey's sitting there  and the maze is moving when you tilt the tablet. Also  I come from Italy  and the design is important in Italy  and yet very conservative. So we worked with a design studio called Habits  in Milan  to make this mirror  which is completely open source. This doubles also as an iPod speaker. So the idea is that the hardware  the software  the design of the object  the fabrication  everything about this project is open source and you can make it yourself. So we want other designers to pick this up and learn how to make great devices  to learn how to make interactive products by starting from something real. But when you have this idea  you know  what happens to all these ideas  There's  like  thousands of ideas that I   You know  it would take seven hours for me to do all the presentations. I will not take all the seven hours. Thank you. But let's start from this example  So  the group of people that started this company called Pebble  they prototyped a watch that communicates via Bluetooth with your phone  and you can display information on it. And they prototyped with an old LCD screen from a Nokia mobile phone and an Arduino. And then  when they had a final project  they actually went to Kickstarter and they were asking for         dollars to make a few of them to sell. They got    million dollars. They got a completely fully funded start up  and they don't have to  you know  get VCs involved or anything  just excite the people with their great project. The last project I want to show you is this  It's called ArduSat. It's currently on Kickstarter  so if you want to contribute  please do it. It's a satellite that goes into space  which is probably the least open source thing you can imagine  and it contains an Arduino connected to a bunch of sensors. So if you know how to use Arduino  you can actually upload your experiments into this satellite and run them. So imagine  if you as a high school can have the satellite for a week and do satellite space experiments like that. So  as I said  there's lots of examples  and I'm going to stop here. And I just want to thank the Arduino community for being the best  and just every day making lots of projects. Thank you.  Applause  And thanks to the community. Chris Anderson  Massimo  you told me earlier today that you had no idea  of course  that it would take off like this. MB  No. CA  I mean  how must you feel when you read this stuff and you see what you've unlocked  MB  Well  it's the work of a lot of people  so we as a community are enabling people to make great stuff  and I just feel overwhelmed. It's just  it's difficult to describe this. Every morning  I wake up and I look at all the stuff that Google Alerts sends me  and it's just amazing. It's just going into every field that you can imagine. CA  Thank you so much.  Applause  Openness. It's a word that denotes opportunity and possibilities. Open ended  open hearth  open source  open door policy  open bar.  Laughter  And everywhere the world is opening up  and it's a good thing. Why is this happening  The technology revolution is opening the world. Yesterday's Internet was a platform for the presentation of content. The Internet of today is a platform for computation. The Internet is becoming a giant global computer  and every time you go on it  you upload a video  you do a Google search  you remix something  you're programming this big global computer that we all share. Humanity is building a machine  and this enables us to collaborate in new ways. Collaboration can occur on an astronomical basis. Now a new generation is opening up the world as well. I started studying kids about    years ago     so actually    years ago now    and I noticed how my own children were effortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology  and at first I thought   My children are prodigies    Laughter  But then I noticed all their friends were like them  so that was a bad theory. So I've started working with a few hundred kids  and I came to the conclusion that this is the first generation to come of age in the digital age  to be bathed in bits. I call them the Net Generation. I said  these kids are different. They have no fear of technology  because it's not there. It's like the air. It's sort of like  I have no fear of a refrigerator. And    Laughter  And there's no more powerful force to change every institution than the first generation of digital natives. I'm a digital immigrant. I had to learn the language. The global economic crisis is opening up the world as well. Our opaque institutions from the Industrial Age  everything from old models of the corporation  government  media  Wall Street  are in various stages of being stalled or frozen or in atrophy or even failing  and this is now creating a burning platform in the world. I mean  think about Wall Street. The core modus operandi of Wall Street almost brought down global capitalism. Now  you know the idea of a burning platform  that you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are become greater than the costs of moving to something different  perhaps something radically different. And we need to change and open up all of our institutions. So this technology push  a demographic kick from a new generation and a demand pull from a new economic global environment is causing the world to open up. Now  I think  in fact  we're at a turning point in human history  where we can finally now rebuild many of the institutions of the Industrial Age around a new set of principles. Now  what is openness  Well  as it turns out  openness has a number of different meanings  and for each there's a corresponding principle for the transformation of civilization. The first is collaboration. Now  this is openness in the sense of the boundaries of organizations becoming more porous and fluid and open. The guy in the picture here  I'll tell you his story. His name is Rob McEwen. I'd like to say   I have this think tank  we scour the world for amazing case studies.  The reason I know this story is because he's my neighbor.  Laughter  He actually moved across the street from us  and he held a cocktail party to meet the neighbors  and he says   You're Don Tapscott. I've read some of your books.  I said   Great. What do you do   And he says   Well I used to be a banker and now I'm a gold miner.  And he tells me this amazing story. He takes over this gold mine  and his geologists can't tell him where the gold is. He gives them more money for geological data  they come back  they can't tell him where to go into production. After a few years  he's so frustrated he's ready to give up  but he has an epiphany one day. He wonders   If my geologists don't know where the gold is  maybe somebody else does.  So he does a  radical  thing. He takes his geological data  he publishes it and he holds a contest on the Internet called the Goldcorp Challenge. It's basically half a million dollars in prize money for anybody who can tell me  do I have any gold  and if so  where is it   Laughter  He gets submissions from all around the world. They use techniques that he's never heard of  and for his half a million dollars in prize money  Rob McEwen finds  .  billion dollars worth of gold. The market value of his company goes from    million to    billion dollars  and I can tell you  because he's my neighbor  he's a happy camper.  Laughter  You know  conventional wisdom says talent is inside  right  Your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night. He viewed talent differently. He wondered  who are their peers  He should have fired his geology department  but he didn't. You know  some of the best submissions didn't come from geologists. They came from computer scientists  engineers. The winner was a computer graphics company that built a three dimensional model of the mine where you can helicopter underground and see where the gold is. He helped us understand that social media's becoming social production. It's not about hooking up online. This is a new means of production in the making. And this Ideagora that he created  an open market  agora  for uniquely qualified minds  was part of a change  a profound change in the deep structure and architecture of our organizations  and how we sort of orchestrate capability to innovate  to create goods and services  to engage with the rest of the world  in terms of government  how we create public value. Openness is about collaboration. Now secondly  openness is about transparency. This is different. Here  we're talking about the communication of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations  employees  customers  business partners  shareholders  and so on. And everywhere  our institutions are becoming naked. People are all bent out of shape about WikiLeaks  but that's just the tip of the iceberg. You see  people at their fingertips now  everybody  not just Julian Assange  have these powerful tools for finding out what's going on  scrutinizing  informing others  and even organizing collective responses. Institutions are becoming naked  and if you're going to be naked  well  there's some corollaries that flow from that. I mean  one is  fitness is no longer optional.  Laughter  You know  Or if you're going to be naked  you'd better get buff. Now  by buff I mean  you need to have good value  because value is evidenced like never before. You say you have good products. They'd better be good. But you also need to have values. You need to have integrity as part of your bones and your DNA as an organization  because if you don't  you'll be unable to build trust  and trust is a sine qua non of this new network world. So this is good. It's not bad. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. And we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world. Now  the third meaning and corresponding principle of openness is about sharing. Now this is different than transparency. Transparency is about the communication of information. Sharing is about giving up assets  intellectual property. And there are all kinds of famous stories about this. IBM gave away     million dollars of software to the Linux movement  and that gave them a multi billion dollar payoff. Now  conventional wisdom says   Well  hey  our intellectual property belongs to us  and if someone tries to infringe it  we're going to get out our lawyers and we're going to sue them.  Well  it didn't work so well for the record labels  did it  I mean  they took   They had a technology disruption  and rather than taking a business model innovation to correspond to that  they took and sought a legal solution and the industry that brought you Elvis and the Beatles is now suing children and is in danger of collapse. So we need to think differently about intellectual property. I'll give you an example. The pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble. First of all  there aren't a lot of big inventions in the pipeline  and this is a big problem for human health  and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem  that they're about to fall off something called the patent cliff. Do you know about this  They're going to lose    to    percent of their revenue in the next    months. And what are you going to do  like  cut back on paper clips or something  No. We need to reinvent the whole model of scientific research. The pharmaceutical industry needs to place assets in a commons. They need to start sharing precompetitive research. They need to start sharing clinical trial data  and in doing so  create a rising tide that could lift all boats  not just for the industry but for humanity. Now  the fourth meaning of openness  and corresponding principle  is about empowerment. And I'm not talking about the motherhood sense here. Knowledge and intelligence is power  and as it becomes more distributed  there's a concomitant distribution and decentralization and disaggregation of power that's underway in the world today. The open world is bringing freedom. Now  take the Arab Spring. The debate about the role of social media and social change has been settled. You know  one word  Tunisia. And then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too. But in the Tunisian revolution  the new media didn't cause the revolution  it was caused by injustice. Social media didn't create the revolution  it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore. But just as the Internet drops transaction and collaboration costs in business and government  it also drops the cost of dissent  of rebellion  and even insurrection in ways that people didn't understand. You know  during the Tunisian revolution  snipers associated with the regime were killing unarmed students in the street. So the students would take their mobile devices  take a picture  triangulate the location  send that picture to friendly military units  who'd come in and take out the snipers. You think that social media is about hooking up online  For these kids  it was a military tool to defend unarmed people from murderers. It was a tool of self defense. You know  as we speak today  young people are being killed in Syria  and up until three months ago  if you were injured on the street  an ambulance would pick you up  take you to the hospital  you'd go in  say  with a broken leg  and you'd come out with a bullet in your head. So these    somethings created an alternative health care system  where what they did is they used Twitter and basic publicly available tools that when someone's injured  a car would show up  it would pick them up  take them to a makeshift medical clinic  where you'd get medical treatment  as opposed to being executed. So this is a time of great change. Now  it's not without its problems. Up until two years ago  all revolutions in human history had a leadership  and when the old regime fell  the leadership and the organization would take power. Well  these wiki revolutions happen so fast they create a vacuum  and politics abhors a vacuum  and unsavory forces can fill that  typically the old regime  or extremists  or fundamentalist forces. You can see this playing out today in Egypt. But that doesn't matter  because this is moving forward. The train has left the station. The cat is out of the bag. The horse is out of the barn. Help me out here  okay  I mean  we're not putting this one back. The open world is bringing empowerment and freedom. I think  at the end of these four days  that you'll come to conclude that the arc of history is a positive one  and it's towards openness. If you go back a few hundred years  all around the world it was a very closed society. It was agrarian  and the means of production and political system was called feudalism  and knowledge was concentrated in the church and the nobility. People didn't know about things. There was no concept of progress. You were born  you lived your life and you died. But then Johannes Gutenberg came along with his great invention  and  over time  the society opened up. People started to learn about things  and when they did  the institutions of feudal society appeared to be stalled  or frozen  or failing. It didn't make sense for the church to be responsible for medicine when people had knowledge. So we saw the Protestant Reformation. Martin Luther called the printing press  God's highest act of grace.  The creation of a corporation  science  the university  eventually the Industrial Revolution  and it was all good. But it came with a cost. And now  once again  the technology genie is out of the bottle  but this time it's different. The printing press gave us access to the written word. The Internet enables each of us to be a producer. The printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge. The Internet gives us access  not just to information and knowledge  but to the intelligence contained in the crania of other people on a global basis. To me  this is not an information age  it's an age of networked intelligence. It's an age of vast promise  an age of collaboration  where the boundaries of our organizations are changing  of transparency  where sunlight is disinfecting civilization  an age of sharing and understanding the new power of the commons  and it's an age of empowerment and of freedom. Now  what I'd like to do is  to close  to share with you some research that I've been doing. I've tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like  but I've been studying nature recently. You know  bees come in swarms and fish come in schools. Starlings  in the area around Edinburgh  in the moors of England  come in something called a murmuration  and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings of the birds  and throughout the day the starlings are out over a    mile radius sort of doing their starling thing. And at night they come together and they create one of the most spectacular things in all of nature  and it's called a murmuration. And scientists that have studied this have said they've never seen an accident. Now  this thing has a function. It protects the birds. You can see on the right here  there's a predator being chased away by the collective power of the birds  and apparently this is a frightening thing if you're a predator of starlings. And there's leadership  but there's no one leader. Now  is this some kind of fanciful analogy  or could we actually learn something from this  Well  the murmuration functions to record a number of principles  and they're basically the principles that I have described to you today. This is a huge collaboration. It's an openness  it's a sharing of all kinds of information  not just about location and trajectory and danger and so on  but about food sources. And there's a real sense of interdependence  that the individual birds somehow understand that their interests are in the interest of the collective. Perhaps like we should understand that business can't succeed in a world that's failing. Well  I look at this thing  and I get a lot of hope. Think about the kids today in the Arab Spring  and you see something like this that's underway. And imagine  just consider this idea  if you would  What if we could connect ourselves in this world through a vast network of air and glass  Could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge  Could we start to share our intelligence  Could we create some kind of collective intelligence that goes beyond an individual or a group or a team to create  perhaps  some kind of consciousness on a global basis  Well  if we could do this  we could attack some big problems in the world. And I look at this thing  and  I don't know  I get a lot of hope that maybe this smaller  networked  open world that our kids inherit might be a better one  and that this new age of networked intelligence could be an age of promise fulfilled and of peril unrequited. Let's do this. Thank you. So I'm a woman with chronic schizophrenia. I've spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals. I might have ended up spending most of my life on the back ward of a hospital  but that isn't how my life turned out. In fact  I've managed to stay clear of hospitals for almost three decades  perhaps my proudest accomplishment. That's not to say that I've remained clear of all psychiatric struggles. After I graduated from the Yale Law School and got my first law job  my New Haven analyst  Dr. White  announced to me that he was going to close his practice in three months  several years before I had planned to leave New Haven. White had been enormously helpful to me  and the thought of his leaving shattered me. My best friend Steve  sensing that something was terribly wrong  flew out to New Haven to be with me. Now I'm going to quote from some of my writings   I opened the door to my studio apartment. Steve would later tell me that  for all the times he had seen me psychotic  nothing could have prepared him for what he saw that day. For a week or more  I had barely eaten. I was gaunt. I walked as though my legs were wooden. My face looked and felt like a mask. I had closed all the curtains in the apartment  so in the middle of the day the apartment was in near total darkness. The air was fetid  the room a shambles. Steve  both a lawyer and a psychologist  has treated many patients with severe mental illness  and to this day he'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen. 'Hi ' I said  and then I returned to the couch  where I sat in silence for several moments. 'Thank you for coming  Steve. Crumbling world  word  voice. Tell the clocks to stop. Time is. Time has come.' 'White is leaving ' Steve said somberly. 'I'm being pushed into a grave. The situation is grave ' I moan. 'Gravity is pulling me down. I'm scared. Tell them to get away.'  As a young woman  I was in a psychiatric hospital on three different occasions for lengthy periods. My doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia  and gave me a prognosis of  grave.  That is  at best  I was expected to live in a board and care  and work at menial jobs. Fortunately  I did not actually enact that grave prognosis. Instead  I'm a chaired Professor of Law  Psychology and Psychiatry at the USC Gould School of Law  I have many close friends and I have a beloved husband  Will  who's here with us today. He's definitely the star of my show. I'd like to share with you how that happened  and also describe my experience of being psychotic. I hasten to add that it's my experience  because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way. Let's start with the definition of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a brain disease. Its defining feature is psychosis  or being out of touch with reality. Delusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of the illness. Delusions are fixed and false beliefs that aren't responsive to evidence  and hallucinations are false sensory experiences. For example  when I'm psychotic I often have the delusion that I've killed hundreds of thousands of people with my thoughts. I sometimes have the idea that nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain. Occasionally  I have hallucinations  like one time I turned around and saw a man with a raised knife. Imagine having a nightmare while you're awake. Often  speech and thinking become disorganized to the point of incoherence. Loose associations involves putting together words that may sound a lot alike but don't make sense  and if the words get jumbled up enough  it's called  word salad.  Contrary to what many people think  schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality. The schizophrenic mind is not split  but shattered. Everyone has seen a street person  unkempt  probably ill fed  standing outside of an office building muttering to himself or shouting. This person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia. But schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic status  and there are people with the illness who are full time professionals with major responsibilities. Several years ago  I decided to write down my experiences and my personal journey  and I want to share some more of that story with you today to convey the inside view. So the following episode happened the seventh week of my first semester of my first year at Yale Law School. Quoting from my writings   My two classmates  Rebel and Val  and I had made the date to meet in the law school library on Friday night to work on our memo assignment together. But we didn't get far before I was talking in ways that made no sense. 'Memos are visitations ' I informed them. 'They make certain points. The point is on your head. Pat used to say that. Have you killed you anyone ' Rebel and Val looked at me as if they or I had been splashed in the face with cold water. 'What are you talking about  Elyn ' 'Oh  you know  the usual. Who's what  what's who  heaven and hell. Let's go out on the roof. It's a flat surface. It's safe.' Rebel and Val followed and they asked what had gotten into me. 'This is the real me ' I announced  waving my arms above my head. And then  late on a Friday night  on the roof of the Yale Law School  I began to sing  and not quietly either. 'Come to the Florida sunshine bush. Do you want to dance ' 'Are you on drugs ' one asked. 'Are you high ' 'High  Me  No way  no drugs. Come to the Florida sunshine bush  where there are lemons  where they make demons.' 'You're frightening me ' one of them said  and Rebel and Val headed back into the library. I shrugged and followed them. Back inside  I asked my classmates if they were having the same experience of words jumping around our cases as I was. 'I think someone's infiltrated my copies of the cases ' I said. 'We've got to case the joint. I don't believe in joints  but they do hold your body together.'     It's an example of loose associations.     Eventually I made my way back to my dorm room  and once there  I couldn't settle down. My head was too full of noise  too full of orange trees and law memos I could not write and mass murders I knew I would be responsible for. Sitting on my bed  I rocked back and forth  moaning in fear and isolation.  This episode led to my first hospitalization in America. I had two earlier in England. Continuing with the writings   The next morning I went to my professor's office to ask for an extension on the memo assignment  and I began gibbering unintelligably as I had the night before  and he eventually brought me to the emergency room. Once there  someone I'll just call 'The Doctor' and his whole team of goons swooped down  lifted me high into the air  and slammed me down on a metal bed with such force that I saw stars. Then they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed with thick leather straps. A sound came out of my mouth that I'd never heard before  half groan  half scream  barely human and pure terror. Then the sound came again  forced from somewhere deep inside my belly and scraping my throat raw.  This incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization. One of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me against my will was that I was  gravely disabled.  To support this view  they wrote in my chart that I was unable to do my Yale Law School homework. I wondered what that meant about much of the rest of New Haven. During the next year  I would spend five months in a psychiatric hospital. At times  I spent up to    hours in mechanical restraints  arms tied  arms and legs tied down  arms and legs tied down with a net tied tightly across my chest. I never struck anyone. I never harmed anyone. I never made any direct threats. If you've never been restrained yourself  you may have a benign image of the experience. There's nothing benign about it. Every week in the United States  it's been estimated that one to three people die in restraints. They strangle  they aspirate their vomit  they suffocate  they have a heart attack. It's unclear whether using mechanical restraints is actually saving lives or costing lives. While I was preparing to write my student note for the Yale Law Journal on mechanical restraints  I consulted an eminent law professor who was also a psychiatrist  and said surely he would agree that restraints must be degrading  painful and frightening. He looked at me in a knowing way  and said   Elyn  you don't really understand  These people are psychotic. They're different from me and you. They wouldn't experience restraints as we would.  I didn't have the courage to tell him in that moment that  no  we're not that different from him. We don't like to be strapped down to a bed and left to suffer for hours any more than he would. In fact  until very recently  and I'm sure some people still hold it as a view  that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe. I've never met a psychiatric patient who agreed with that view. Today  I'd like to say I'm very pro psychiatry but very anti force. I don't think force is effective as treatment  and I think using force is a terrible thing to do to another person with a terrible illness. Eventually  I came to Los Angeles to teach at the University of Southern California Law School. For years  I had resisted medication  making many  many efforts to get off. I felt that if I could manage without medication  I could prove that  after all  I wasn't really mentally ill  it was some terrible mistake. My motto was the less medicine  the less defective. My L.A. analyst  Dr. Kaplan  was urging me just to stay on medication and get on with my life  but I decided I wanted to make one last college try to get off. Quoting from the text   I started the reduction of my meds  and within a short time I began feeling the effects. After returning from a trip to Oxford  I marched into Kaplan's office  headed straight for the corner  crouched down  covered my face  and began shaking. All around me I sensed evil beings poised with daggers. They'd slice me up in thin slices or make me swallow hot coals. Kaplan would later describe me as 'writhing in agony.' Even in this state  what he accurately described as acutely and forwardly psychotic  I refused to take more medication. The mission is not yet complete. Immediately after the appointment with Kaplan  I went to see Dr. Marder  a schizophrenia expert who was following me for medication side effects. He was under the impression that I had a mild psychotic illness. Once in his office  I sat on his couch  folded over  and began muttering. 'Head explosions and people trying to kill. Is it okay if I totally trash your office ' 'You need to leave if you think you're going to do that ' said Marder. 'Okay. Small. Fire on ice. Tell them not to kill me. Tell them not to kill me. What have I done wrong  Hundreds of thousands with thoughts  interdiction.' 'Elyn  do you feel like you're dangerous to yourself or others  I think you need to be in the hospital. I could get you admitted right away  and the whole thing could be very discrete.' 'Ha  ha  ha. You're offering to put me in hospitals  Hospitals are bad  they're mad  they're sad. One must stay away. I'm God  or I used to be.'  At that point in the text  where I said  I'm God  or I used to be   my husband made a marginal note. He said   Did you quit or were you fired    'I give life and I take it away. Forgive me  for I know not what I do.' Eventually  I broke down in front of friends  and everybody convinced me to take more medication. I could no longer deny the truth  and I could not change it. The wall that kept me  Elyn  Professor Saks  separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past  lay smashed and in ruins.  Everything about this illness says I shouldn't be here  but I am. And I am  I think  for three reasons  First  I've had excellent treatment. Four  to five day a week psychoanalytic psychotherapy for decades and continuing  and excellent psychopharmacology. Second  I have many close family members and friends who know me and know my illness. These relationships have given my life a meaning and a depth  and they also helped me navigate my life in the face of symptoms. Third  I work at an enormously supportive workplace at USC Law School. This is a place that not only accommodates my needs but actually embraces them. It's also a very intellectually stimulating place  and occupying my mind with complex problems has been my best and most powerful and most reliable defense against my mental illness. Even with all that   excellent treatment  wonderful family and friends  supportive work environment   I did not make my illness public until relatively late in life  and that's because the stigma against mental illness is so powerful that I didn't feel safe with people knowing. If you hear nothing else today  please hear this  There are not  schizophrenics.  There are people with schizophrenia  and these people may be your spouse  they may be your child  they may be your neighbor  they may be your friend  they may be your coworker. So let me share some final thoughts. We need to invest more resources into research and treatment of mental illness. The better we understand these illnesses  the better the treatments we can provide  and the better the treatments we can provide  the more we can offer people care  and not have to use force. Also  we must stop criminalizing mental illness. It's a national tragedy and scandal that the L.A. County Jail is the biggest psychiatric facility in the United States. American prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer from severe mental illness  and many of them are there because they never received adequate treatment. I could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself. A message to the entertainment industry and to the press  On the whole  you've done a wonderful job fighting stigma and prejudice of many kinds. Please  continue to let us see characters in your movies  your plays  your columns  who suffer with severe mental illness. Portray them sympathetically  and portray them in all the richness and depth of their experience as people and not as diagnoses. Recently  a friend posed a question  If there were a pill I could take that would instantly cure me  would I take it  The poet Rainer Maria Rilke was offered psychoanalysis. He declined  saying   Don't take my devils away  because my angels may flee too.  My psychosis  on the other hand  is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying that all my angels have already fled. So would I take the pill  In an instant. That said  I don't wish to be seen as regretting the life I could have had if I'd not been mentally ill  nor am I asking anyone for their pity. What I rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share is more important than the mental illness we may not. What those of us who suffer with mental illness want is what everybody wants  in the words of Sigmund Freud   to work and to love.  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. You're very kind.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  The phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment is called quantum levitation and quantum locking. And the object that was levitating here is called a superconductor. Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter  and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature. Now  it's quite an old phenomenon  it was discovered     years ago. However  only recently  due to several technological advancements  we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation and quantum locking. So  a superconductor is defined by two properties. The first is zero electrical resistance  and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor. That sounds complicated  right  But what is electrical resistance  So  electricity is the flow of electrons inside a material. And these electrons  while flowing  they collide with the atoms  and in these collisions they lose a certain amount of energy. And they dissipate this energy in the form of heat  and you know that effect. However  inside a superconductor there are no collisions  so there is no energy dissipation. It's quite remarkable. Think about it. In classical physics  there is always some friction  some energy loss. But not here  because it is a quantum effect. But that's not all  because superconductors don't like magnetic fields. So a superconductor will try to expel magnetic field from the inside  and it has the means to do that by circulating currents. Now  the combination of both effects    the expulsion of magnetic fields and zero electrical resistance    is exactly a superconductor. But the picture isn't always perfect  as we all know  and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor. Now  under proper conditions  which we have here  these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor. And these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor  they come in discrete quantities. Why  Because it is a quantum phenomenon. It's quantum physics. And it turns out that they behave like quantum particles. In this movie here  you can see how they flow one by one discretely. This is strands of magnetic field. These are not particles  but they behave like particles. So  this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking. But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field  Well  first there are strands of magnetic field left inside  but now the superconductor doesn't like them moving around  because their movements dissipate energy  which breaks the superconductivity state. So what it actually does  it locks these strands  which are called fluxons  and it locks these fluxons in place. And by doing that  what it actually does is locking itself in place. Why  Because any movement of the superconductor will change their place  will change their configuration. So we get quantum locking. And let me show you how this works. I have here a superconductor  which I wrapped up so it'd stay cold long enough. And when I place it on top of a regular magnet  it just stays locked in midair. Now  this is not just levitation. It's not just repulsion. I can rearrange the fluxons  and it will be locked in this new configuration. Like this  or move it slightly to the right or to the left. So  this is quantum locking    actually locking    three dimensional locking of the superconductor. Of course  I can turn it upside down  and it will remain locked. Now  now that we understand that this so called levitation is actually locking  Yeah  we understand that. You won't be surprised to hear that if I take this circular magnet  in which the magnetic field is the same all around  the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet. Why  Because as long as it rotates  the locking is maintained. You see  I can adjust and I can rotate the superconductor. We have frictionless motion. It is still levitating  but can move freely all around. So  we have quantum locking and we can levitate it on top of this magnet. But how many fluxons  how many magnetic strands are there in a single disk like this  Well  we can calculate it  and it turns out  quite a lot. One hundred billion strands of magnetic field inside this three inch disk. But that's not the amazing part yet  because there is something I haven't told you yet. And  yeah  the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here is only half a micron thick. It's extremely thin. And this extremely thin layer is able to levitate more than        times its own weight. It's a remarkable effect. It's very strong. Now  I can extend this circular magnet  and make whatever track I want. For example  I can make a large circular rail here. And when I place the superconducting disk on top of this rail  it moves freely. And again  that's not all. I can adjust its position like this  and rotate  and it freely moves in this new position. And I can even try a new thing  let's try it for the first time. I can take this disk and put it here  and while it stays here    don't move    I will try to rotate the track  and hopefully  if I did it correctly  it stays suspended. You see  it's quantum locking  not levitation. Now  while I'll let it circulate for a little more  let me tell you a little bit about superconductors. Now     Laughter     So we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors  so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields  such as needed in MRI machines  particle accelerators and so on. But we can also store energy using superconductors  because we have no dissipation. And we could also produce power cables  to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations. Imagine you could back up a single power station with a single superconducting cable. But what is the future of quantum levitation and quantum locking  Well  let me answer this simple question by giving you an example. Imagine you would have a disk similar to the one I have here in my hand  three inch diameter  with a single difference. The superconducting layer  instead of being half a micron thin  being two millimeters thin  quite thin. This two millimeter thin superconducting layer could hold       kilograms  a small car  in my hand. Amazing. Thank you. I'd like to talk about my dad. My dad has Alzheimer's disease. He started showing the symptoms about    years ago  and he was officially diagnosed in     . Now he's really pretty sick. He needs help eating  he needs help getting dressed  he doesn't really know where he is or when it is  and it's been really  really hard. My dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life  and I've spent the last decade watching him disappear. My dad's not alone. There's about    million people globally living with some kind of dementia  and by      they're expecting that to double to    million. That's a lot of people. Dementia scares us. The confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia  the big numbers of people who get it  they frighten us. And because of that fear  we tend to do one of two things  We go into denial   It's not me  it has nothing to do with me  it's never going to happen to me.  Or  we decide that we're going to prevent dementia  and it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us. I'm looking for a third way  I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease. Prevention is good  and I'm doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer's. I'm eating right  I'm exercising every day  I'm keeping my mind active  that's what the research says you should do. But the research also shows that there's nothing that will     percent protect you. If the monster wants you  the monster's gonna get you. That's what happened with my dad. My dad was a bilingual college professor. His hobbies were chess  bridge and writing op eds. He got dementia anyway. If the monster wants you  the monster's gonna get you. Especially if you're me  'cause Alzheimer's tends to run in families. So I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease. Based on what I've learned from taking care of my father  and researching what it's like to live with dementia  I'm focusing on three things in my preparation  I'm changing what I do for fun  I'm working to build my physical strength  and    this is the hard one    I'm trying to become a better person. Let's start with the hobbies. When you get dementia  it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself. You can't sit and have long talks with your old friends  because you don't know who they are. It's confusing to watch television  and often very frightening. And reading is just about impossible. When you care for someone with dementia  and you get training  they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar  hands on  open ended. With my dad  that turned out to be letting him fill out forms. He was a college professor at a state school  he knows what paperwork looks like. He'll sign his name on every line  he'll check all the boxes  he'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers. But it got me thinking  what would my caregivers do with me  I'm my father's daughter. I read  I write  I think about global health a lot. Would they give me academic journals so I could scribble in the margins  Would they give me charts and graphs that I could color  So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands on. I've always liked to draw  so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it. I am learning some basic origami. I can make a really great box. And I'm teaching myself to knit  which so far I can knit a blob. But  you know  it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it. What matters is that my hands know how to do it. Because the more things that are familiar  the more things my hands know how to do  the more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymore. They say that people who are engaged in activities are happier  easier for their caregivers to look after  and it may even slow the progress of the disease. That all seems like win to me. I want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can. A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms  as well as cognitive symptoms. You lose your sense of balance  you get muscle tremors  and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile. They get scared to walk around. They get scared to move. So I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance. I'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance  so that when I start to lose it  I'll still be able to be mobile. I'm doing weight bearing exercise  so that I have the muscle strength so that when I start to wither  I have more time that I can still move around. Finally  the third thing. I'm trying to become a better person. My dad was kind and loving before he had Alzheimer's  and he's kind and loving now. I've seen him lose his intellect  his sense of humor  his language skills  but I've also seen this  He loves me  he loves my sons  he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers. And that love makes us want to be around him  even now. even when it's so hard. When you take away everything that he ever learned in this world  his naked heart still shines. I was never as kind as my dad  and I was never as loving. And what I need now is to learn to be like that. I need a heart so pure that if it's stripped bare by dementia  it will survive. I don't want to get Alzheimer's disease. What I want is a cure in the next    years  soon enough to protect me. But if it comes for me  I'm going to be ready. Thank you. About    years ago  my grandfather  a young man  walked into a tent that was converted into a movie theater like that  and he fell hopelessly in love with the woman he saw on the silver screen  none other than Mae West  the heartthrob of the '  s  and he could never forget her. In fact  when he had his daughter many years later  he wanted to name her after Mae West  but can you imagine an Indian child name Mae West  The Indian family said  no way  So when my twin brother Kaesava was born  he decided to tinker with the spelling of Keshava's name. He said  if Mae West can be M A E  why can't Keshava be K A E  So he changed Kaesava's spelling. Now Kaesava had a baby boy called Rehan a couple of weeks ago. He decided to spell  or  rather  misspell Raehan with an A E. You know  my grandfather died many years ago when I was little  but his love for Mae West lives on as a misspelling in the DNA of his progeny. That for me is successful legacy.  Laughs  You know  as for me  my wife and I have our own crazy legacy project. We actually sit every few years  argue  disagree  fight  and actually come up with our very own     year plan. Our friends think we're mad. Our parents think we're cuckoo. Because  you know  we both come from families that really look up to humility and wisdom  but we both like to live larger than life. I believe in the concept of a Raja Yogi  Be a dude before you can become an ascetic. This is me being a rock star  even if it's in my own house. You know  So when Netra and I sat down to make our first plan    years ago  we said we want the focus of this plan to go way beyond ourselves. What do we mean by beyond ourselves  Well     years  we calculated  is at the end of our direct contact with the world. There's nobody I'll meet in my life will ever live beyond     years  so we thought that's a perfect place where we should situate our plan and let our imagination take flight. You know  I never really believed in legacy. What am I going to leave behind  I'm an artist. Until I made a cartoon about     . It caused so much trouble for me. I was so upset. You know  a cartoon that was meant to be a cartoon of the week ended up staying so much longer. Now I'm in the business of creating art that will definitely even outlive me  and I think about what I want to leave behind through those paintings. You know  the      cartoon upset me so much that I decided I'll never cartoon again. I said  I'm never going to make any honest public commentary again. But of course I continued creating artwork that was honest and raw  because I forgot about how people reacted to my work. You know  sometimes forgetting is so important to remain idealistic. Perhaps loss of memory is so crucial for our survival as human beings. One of the most important things in my     year plan that Netra and I write is what to forget about ourselves. You know  we carry so much baggage  from our parents  from our society  from so many people    fears  insecurities    and our     year plan really lists all our childhood problems that we have to expire. We actually put an expiry date on all our childhood problems. The latest date I put was  I said  I am going to expire my fear of my leftist  feminist mother in law  and this today is the date   Laughs  She's watching.  Laughter  Anyway  you know  I really make decisions all the time about how I want to remember myself  and that's the most important kind of decisions I make. And this directly translates into my paintings. But like my friends  I can do that really well on Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Flickr  YouTube. Name it  I'm on it. I've started outsourcing my memory to the digital world  you know  But that comes with a problem. It's so easy to think of technology as a metaphor for memory  but our brains are not perfect storage devices like technology. We only remember what we want to. At least I do. And I rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory  you know  And if technology is not a metaphor for memory  what is it  Netra and I use our technology as a tool in our     year plan to really curate our digital legacy. That is a picture of my mother  and she recently got a Facebook account. You know where this is going. And I've been very supportive until this picture shows up on my Facebook page.  Laughter  And I actually untagged myself first  then I picked up the phone. I said   Mom  you will never put a picture of me in a bikini ever again.  And she said   Why  You look so cute  darling.  I said   You just don't understand.  Maybe we are among the first generation that really understands this digital curating of ourselves. Maybe we are the first to even actively record our lives. You know  whether you agree with  you know  legacy or not  we are actually leaving behind digital traces all the time. So Netra and I really wanted to use our     year plan to curate this digital legacy  and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future. How  you may ask  Well  when I think of the future  I never see myself moving forward in time. I actually see time moving backward towards me. I can actually visualize my future approaching. I can dodge what I don't want and pull in what I want. It's like a video game obstacle course. And I've gotten better and better at doing this. Even when I make a painting  I actually imagine I'm behind the painting  it already exists  and someone's looking at it  and I see whether they're feeling it from their gut. Are they feeling it from their heart  or is it just a cerebral thing  And it really informs my painting. Even when I do an art show  I really think about  what should people walk away with  I remember when I was     I did  I wanted to do my first art exhibition  and I wanted the whole world to know about it. I didn't know TED then  but what I did was I closed my eyes tight  and I started dreaming. I could imagine people coming in  dressed up  looking beautiful  my paintings with all the light  and in my visualization I actually saw a very famous actress launching my show  giving credibility to me. And I woke up from my visualization and I said  who was that  I couldn't tell if it was Shabana Azmi or Rekha  two very famous Indian actresses  like the Meryl Streeps of India. As it turned out  next morning I wrote a letter to both of them  and Shabana Azmi replied  and came and launched my very first show    years ago. And what a bang it started my career with  You know  when we think of time in this way  we can curate not only the future but also the past. This is a picture of my family  and that is Netra  my wife. She's the co creator of my     year plan. Netra's a high school history teacher. I love Netra  but I hate history. I keep saying   Nets  you live in the past while I'll create the future  and when I'm done  you can study about it.  She gave me an indulgent smile  and as punishment  she said   Tomorrow I'm teaching a class on Indian history  and you are sitting in it  and I'm grading you.  I'm like   Oh  God.  I went. I actually went and sat in on her class. She started by giving students primary source documents from India  Pakistan  from Britain  and I said   Wow.  Then she asked them to separate fact from bias. I said   Wow   again. Then she said   Choose your facts and biases and create an image of your own story of dignity.  History as an imaging tool  I was so inspired. I went and created my own version of Indian history. I actually included stories from my grandmother. She used to work for the telephone exchange  and she used to actually overhear conversations between Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten. And she used to hear all kinds of things she shouldn't have heard. But  you know  I include things like that. This is my version of Indian history. You know  if this is so  it occurred to me that maybe  just maybe  the primary objective of our brains is to serve our dignity. Go tell Facebook to figure that out  Netra and I don't write our     year plan for someone else to come and execute it in     years. Imagine receiving a parcel saying  from the past  okay now you're supposed to spend the rest of your life doing all of this. No. We actually write it only to set our attitudes right. You know  I used to believe that education is the most important tool to leave a meaningful legacy. Education is great. It really teaches us who we are  and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world  but it's really my creativity that's taught me that I can be much more than what my education told me I am. I'd like to make the argument that creativity is the most important tool we have. It lets us create who we are  and curate what is to come. I like to think    Thank you. I like to think of myself as a storyteller  where my past and my future are only stories  my stories  waiting to be told and retold. I hope all of you one day get a chance to share and write your own     year story. Thank you so much. Shukran   Applause  In the ocean  what is the common point between oil  plastic and radioactivity  On the top line  this is the BP oil spill  billions of barrels of oil gushing in the Gulf of Mexico. The middle line is millions of tons of plastic debris accumulating in our ocean  and the third line is radioactive material leaking from Fukushima nuclear power plant in the Pacific Ocean. Well  the three big problems have in common that they are man made problems but they are controlled by natural forces. This should make us feel very  terribly awful as much as it should make us feel hopeful  because if we have the power to create these problems  we may as well have the power to remediate these problems. But what about natural forces  Well  that's exactly what I want to talk about today  is how we can use these natural forces to remediate these man made problems. When the BP oil spill happened  I was working at MIT  and I was in charge of developing an oil spill cleaning technology. And I had a chance to go in the Gulf of Mexico and meet some fishermen and see the terrible conditions in which they were working. More than     of these boats  which are fishermen boats repurposed with oil absorbent in white and oil containment in orange  were used  but they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface  and the health of the cleaners were very deeply affected. I was working on a very interesting technology at MIT  but it was a very long term view of how to develop technology  and it was going to be a very expensive technology  and also it would be patented. So I wanted to develop something that we could develop very fast  that would be cheap  and that would be open source  so  because oil spills are not only happening in the Gulf of Mexico  and that would be using renewable energy. So I quit my dream job  and I moved to New Orleans  and I kept on studying how the oil spill was happening. Currently  what they were doing is that they were using these small fishing boats  and they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt. If you're using the exact same amount of surface of oil absorbent  but you're just paying attention to natural patterns  and if you're going up the winds  you can collect a lot more material. If you're multiplying the rig  so you multiply how many layers of absorbent you're using  you can collect a lot more. But it's extremely difficult to move oil absorbent against the winds  the surface currents and the waves. These are enormous forces. So the very simple idea was to use the ancient technique of sailing and tacking of the wind to capture or intercept the oil that is drifting down the wind. So this didn't require any invention. We just took a simple sailing boat and we tried to pull something long and heavy  but as we tacked back and forth  what we lost was two things  we were losing pulling power and direction. And so  I thought  what about if we just take the rudder from the back of the boat to the front  would we have better control  So I built this small sailing robot with the rudder at the front  and I was trying to pull something very long and heavy  so that's a four meter long object just to pull  and I was surprised with just a    centimeter rudder  I could control four meters of absorbent. Then I was so happy that I kept playing with the robot  and so you see the robot has a front rudder here. Normally it's at the back. And  playing  I realized that the maneuverability of this was really amazing  and I could avoid an obstacle at the very last second  more maneuverable than a normal boat. Then I started publishing online  and some friends from Korea  they started being interested in this  and we made a boat which has a front rudder and a back rudder  so we started interacting with this  and it was slightly better  although it was very small and a bit off balance  but then we thought  what if we have more than two points of control  What if the entire boat becomes a point of control  What if the entire boat changes shape  So    Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  And so that's the beginning of Protei  and that's the first boat in history that completely changed the shape of the hull in order to control it  and the properties of sailing that we get are very superior compared to a normal boat. When we're turning  we have the feeling of surfing  and the way it's going up wind  it's very efficient. This is low speed  low wind speed  and the maneuverability is very increased  and here I'm going to do a small jibe  and look at the position of the sail. What's happening is that  because the boat changes shape  the position of the front sail and the main sail are different to the wind. We're catching wind from both sides. And this is exactly what we're looking  for  if we want to pull something long and heavy. We don't want to lose pulling power  nor direction. So  I wanted to know if this was possible to put this at an industrial level  so we made a large boat with a large sail  and with a very light hull  inflatable  very small footprint  so we have a very big size and power ratio. After this  we wanted to see if we could implement this and automate the system  so we used the same system but we added a structure to it so we could activate the machine. So  we used the same bladder inflated system  and we took it for testing. So this is happening in the Netherlands. We tried in the water without any skin or ballast just to see how it works. And then we mounted a camera for controlling it  but quickly we saw that we would need a lot more weight at the bottom  so we had to take it back to the lab  and then we built a skin around it  we put batteries  remote controllers  and then we put it in the water and then we let it go in the water and see how well it would work  so let some rope out  and hope it's going to work  and it worked okay  but we still have a long way. Our small prototype has given us good insight that it's working very well  but we still need to work a lot more on this. So what we are doing is an accelerated evolution of sailing technology. We went from a back rudder to a front rudder to two rudders to multiple rudders to the whole boat changing shape  and the more we are moving forward  and the more the design looks simple and cute.  Laughter  But I wanted to show you a fish because    In fact  it's very different from a fish. A fish will move because    by changing like this  but our boat is propelled by the wind still  and the hull controls the trajectory. So I brought to you for the first time on the TED stage Protei Number Eight. It's not the last one  but it's a good one for making demos. So the first thing as I show you in the video is that we may be able to control the trajectory of a sailing boat better  or we may be able to never be in irons  so never facing the wind  we always can catch the wind from both sides. But new properties of a sailing boat. So if you're looking at the boat from this side  this might remind you of an airplane profile. An airplane  when you're moving in this direction  starts to lift  and that's how it takes off. Now  if you're taking the same system  and you're putting vertical  you're bending  and if you're moving this way forward  your instinct will tell you that you might go this way  but if you're moving fast enough  you might create what we call lateral lift  so we could get further or closer to the wind. Other property is this  A normal sailing boat has a centerboard here and a rudder at the back  and these two things are what creates most resistance and turbulence behind the boat  but because this doesn't have either a centerboard or a rudder  we hope that if we keep working on this hull design we can improve and have less resistance. The other thing is  most boats  when they reach a certain speed  and they are going on waves  they start to hit and slap on the surface of the water  and a lot of the energy moving forward is lost. But if we're going with the flow  if we pay attention to natural patterns instead of trying to be strong  but if you're going with the flow  we may absorb a lot of environmental noises  so the wave energy  to actually save some energy to move forward. So we may have developed the technology which is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy  but the idea is  what is the purpose of technology if it doesn't reach the right hands  Normal technology or innovation happens like this  Somebody has an interesting idea  some other scientist or engineer  they take it to the next level  they make a theory about it and maybe they patent it  and then some industry will make a contract of exclusivity to manufacture and sell it  and then  eventually  a buyer will buy it  and we hope that they are going to use  it  for a good purpose. What we really want is that this innovation happens continuously. The inventor and engineers and also the manufacturers and everybody works at the same time  but this would be sterile if this was happening in a parallel and uncrossed process. What you really want is not a sequential  not parallel development. You want to have a network of innovation. You want everybody  like we're doing now  to work at the same time  and that can only happen if these people all together decide to share the information  and that's exactly what open hardware is about. It's to replace competition by collaboration. It's to transform any new product into a new market. So what is open hardware  Essentially  open hardware is a license. It's just an intellectual property setup. It means that everybody is free to use  modify and distribute  and in exchange we only ask for two things  The name is credited    the name of the project    and also the people who make improvement  they share back with the community. So it's a very simple condition. And I started this project alone in a garage in New Orleans  but quickly after I wanted to publish and share this information  so I made a Kickstarter  which is a crowd fundraising platform  and in about one month we fundraised        dollars. With this money  I hired a team of young engineers from all over the world  and we rented a factory in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We were peer learning  we were engineering  we were making things  prototyping  but most importantly we were trying our prototypes in the water as often as possible  to fail as quickly as possible  to learn from. This is a proud member of Protei from Korea  and on the right side  this is a multiple masts design proposed by a team in Mexico. This idea really appealed to Gabriella Levine in New York  and so she decided to prototype this idea that she saw  and she documented every step of the process  and she published it on Instructables  which is a website for sharing inventions. Less than one week after  this is a team in Eindhoven  it's a school of engineering. They made it  but they eventually published a simplified design. They also made it into an Instructable  and in less than one week  they had almost        views  and they got many new friends. We're working on also simpler technology  not that complex  with younger people and also older people  like this dinosaur is from Mexico.  Laughter  So Protei is now an international network of innovation for selling technology using this shape shifting hull. And what puts us together is that we have a common  at least  global understanding of what the word  business  is  or what it should be. This is how most work today. Business as usual is saying  what's most important is to make lots of profit  and you'll be using technology for that  and people will be your work force  instrumentalized  and environment is usually the last priority. It will be just a way to  say  greenwash your audience and  say  increase your price tag. What we're trying to do  or what we believe  because this is how we believe the world really works  is that without the environment you have nothing. We have the people so we need to protect each other  yes  and we're a technology company  and profit is necessary to make this happen.  Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  If we have the courage to understand or accept that this actually how the world really works  and this is the order of priority that we need to choose  then it makes obvious why we need to choose open hardware for developing environmental technology  because we need to share information. What's next for us  So  this small machine that you've seen  we're hoping to make small toys like one meter remote control Protei that you can upgrade    so replace the remote control parts by Androids  so the mobile phone  and Arduino micro controller  so you could be controlling this from your mobile phone  your tablet. Then what we want to do is create six meter versions so we can test the maximum performance of these machines  so we can go at very  very high speed. So imagine yourself. You are laying down in a flexible torpedo  sailing at high speed  controlling the shape of the hull with your legs and controlling the sail with your arms. So that's what we're looking for developing.  Applause  And we replace the human being    to go  for example  for measuring radioactivity  you don't want a human to be sailing those robots    with batteries  motors  micro controllers and sensors. This is what our teammates  we dream of at night. We hope that we can sometime clean up oil spills  or we can gather or collect plastic in the ocean  or we can have swarms of our machines controlled by multi player video game engines to control many of these machines  to monitor coral reefs or to monitor fisheries. Our hope is that we can use open hardware technology to better understand and protect our oceans. Thank you very much.  Applause  I'm a gamer  so I like to have goals. I like special missions and secret objectives. So here's my special mission for this talk  I'm going to try to increase the life span of every single person in this room by seven and a half minutes. Literally  you will live seven and a half minutes longer than you would have otherwise  just because you watched this talk. Some of you are looking a little bit skeptical. That's okay  because check it out    I have math to prove that it is possible. It won't make much sense now. I'll explain it all later  just pay attention to the number at the bottom    .         minutes. That will be my gift to you if I'm successful in my mission. Now  you have a secret mission too. Your mission is to figure out how you want to spend your extra seven and a half minutes. And I think you should do something unusual with them  because these are bonus minutes. You weren't going to have them anyway. Now  because I'm a game designer  you might be thinking to yourself  I know what she wants us to do with those minutes  she wants us to spend them playing games. Now this is a totally reasonable assumption  given that I have made quite a habit of encouraging people to spend more time playing games. For example  in my first TED Talk  I did propose that we should spend    billion hours a week  as a planet  playing video games. Now     billion hours  it's a lot of time. It's so much time  in fact  that the number one unsolicited comment that I have heard from people all over the world since I gave that talk  is this  Jane  games are great and all  but on your deathbed  are you really going to wish you spent more time playing Angry Birds  This idea is so pervasive    that games are a waste of time that we will come to regret    that I hear it literally everywhere I go. For example  true story  Just a few weeks ago  this cab driver  upon finding out that a friend and I were in town for a game developers' conference  turned around and said    and I quote     I hate games. Waste of life. Imagine getting to the end of your life and regretting all that time.  Now  I want to take this problem seriously. I want games to be a force for good in the world. I don't want gamers to regret the time they spent playing  time that I encouraged them to spend. So I have been thinking about this question a lot lately. When we're on our deathbeds  will we regret the time we spent playing games  Now  this may surprise you  but it turns out there is actually some scientific research on this question. It's true. Hospice workers  the people who take care of us at the end of our lives  recently issued a report on the most frequently expressed regrets that people say when they are literally on their deathbeds. And that's what I want to share with you today    the top five regrets of the dying. Number one  I wish I hadn't worked so hard. Number two  I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends. Number three  I wish I had let myself be happier. Number four  I wish I'd had the courage to express my true self. And number five  I wish I'd lived a life true to my dreams  instead of what others expected of me. Now  as far as I know  no one ever told one of the hospice workers   I wish I'd spent more time playing video games   but when I hear these top five regrets of the dying  I can't help but hear five deep human cravings that games actually help us fulfill. For example  I wish I hadn't worked so hard. For many people  this means  I wish I'd spent more time with my family  with my kids when they were growing up. Well  we know that playing games together has tremendous family benefits. A recent study from Brigham Young University School of Family Life reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids have much stronger real life relationships with them.  I wish I'd stayed in touch with my friends.  Hundreds of millions of people use social games like FarmVille or Words With Friends to stay in daily contact with real life friends and family. A recent study from the University of Michigan showed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship management tools. They help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from  if we weren't playing games together.  I wish I'd let myself be happier.  Well  here I can't help but think of the groundbreaking clinical trials recently conducted at East Carolina University that showed that online games can outperform pharmaceuticals for treating clinical anxiety and depression. Just    minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic boosts in mood and long term increases in happiness.  I wish I'd had the courage to express my true self.  Well  avatars are a way to express our true selves  our most heroic  idealized version of who we might become. You can see that in this alter ego portrait by Robbie Cooper of a gamer with his avatar. And Stanford University has been doing research for five years now to document how playing a game with an idealized avatar changes how we think and act in real life  making us more courageous  more ambitious  more committed to our goals.  I wish I'd led a life true to my dreams  and not what others expected of me.  Are games doing this yet  I'm not sure  so I've left a Super Mario question mark. We're going to come back to this one. But in the meantime  perhaps you're wondering  who is this game designer to be talking to us about deathbed regrets  And it's true  I've never worked in a hospice  I've never been on my deathbed. But recently I did spend three months in bed  wanting to die. Really wanting to die. Now let me tell you that story. It started two years ago  when I hit my head and got a concussion. The concussion didn't heal properly  and after    days  I was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches  nausea  vertigo  memory loss  mental fog. My doctor told me that in order to heal my brain  I had to rest it. So I had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms. For me that meant no reading  no writing  no video games  no work or email  no running  no alcohol  no caffeine. In other words    and I think you see where this is going    no reason to live. Of course it's meant to be funny  but in all seriousness  suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries. It happens to one in three  and it happened to me. My brain started telling me   Jane  you want to die.  It said   You're never going to get better.  It said   The pain will never end.  And these voices became so persistent and so persuasive that I started to legitimately fear for my life  which is the time that I said to myself after    days    and I will never forget this moment    I said   I am either going to kill myself or I'm going to turn this into a game.  Now  why a game  I knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade that when we play a game    and this is in the scientific literature    we tackle tough challenges with more creativity  more determination  more optimism  and we're more likely to reach out to others for help. I wanted to bring these gamer traits to my real life challenge  so I created a role playing recovery game called Jane the Concussion Slayer. Now this became my new secret identity  and the first thing I did as a slayer was call my twin sister    I have an identical twin sister named Kelly    and tell her   I'm playing a game to heal my brain  and I want you to play with me.  This was an easier way to ask for help. She became my first ally in the game  my husband Kiyash joined next  and together we identified and battled the bad guys. Now this was anything that could trigger my symptoms and therefore slow down the healing process  things like bright lights and crowded spaces. We also collected and activated power ups. This was anything I could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good  just a little bit productive. Things like cuddling my dog for    minutes  or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once. Now the game was that simple  Adopt a secret identity  recruit your allies  battle the bad guys  activate the power ups. But even with a game so simple  within just a couple days of starting to play  that fog of depression and anxiety went away. It just vanished. It felt like a miracle. Now it wasn't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms. That lasted for more than a year  and it was the hardest year of my life by far. But even when I still had the symptoms  even while I was still in pain  I stopped suffering. Now what happened next with the game surprised me. I put up some blog posts and videos online  explaining how to play. But not everybody has a concussion  obviously  not everyone wants to be  the slayer   so I renamed the game SuperBetter. And soon  I started hearing from people all over the world who were adopting their own secret identity  recruiting their own allies  and they were getting  super better   facing challenges like cancer and chronic pain  depression and Crohn's disease. Even people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like ALS. And I could tell from their messages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me. They talked about feeling stronger and braver. They talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family. And they even talked about feeling happier  even though they were in pain  even though they were tackling the toughest challenge of their lives. Now at the time  I'm thinking to myself  what is going on here  I mean  how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully in such serious  and in some cases life and death  circumstances  I mean  if it hadn't worked for me  there's no way I would have believed it was possible. Well  it turns out there's some science here  too. Some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event. And that's what was happening to us. The game was helping us experience what scientists call post traumatic growth  which is not something we usually hear about. We usually hear about post traumatic stress disorder. But scientists now know that a traumatic event doesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely. Instead  we can use it as a springboard to unleash our best qualities and lead happier lives. Here are the top five things that people with post traumatic growth say   My priorities have changed.   I'm not afraid to do what makes me happy.   I feel closer to my friends and family.   I understand myself better. I know who I really am now.   I have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life.   I'm better able to focus on my goals and dreams.  Now  does this sound familiar  It should  because the top five traits of post traumatic growth are essentially the direct opposite of the top five regrets of the dying. Now this is interesting  right  It seems that somehow  a traumatic event can unlock our ability to lead a life with fewer regrets. But how does it work  How do you get from trauma to growth  Or better yet  is there a way to get all the benefits of post traumatic growth without the trauma  without having to hit your head in the first place  That would be good  right  I wanted to understand the phenomenon better  so I devoured the scientific literature  and here's what I learned. There are four kinds of strength  or resilience  that contribute to post traumatic growth  and there are scientifically validated activities that you can do every day to build up these four kinds of resilience  and you don't need a trauma to do it. I could tell you what these four types of strength are  but I'd rather you experience them firsthand. I'd rather we all start building them up together right now. Here's what we're going to do. We'll play a quick game together. This is where you earn the seven and a half minutes of bonus life that I promised you earlier. All you have to do is successfully complete the first four SuperBetter quests. And I feel like you can do it. I have confidence in you. So  everybody ready  This is your first quest. Here we go. Pick one  Stand up and take three steps  or make your hands into fists  raise them over your head as high as you can for five seconds  go  All right  I like the people doing both. You are overachievers. Very good. Well done  everyone. That is worth    physical resilience  which means that your body can withstand more stress and heal itself faster. We know from the research that the number one thing you can do to boost your physical resilience is to not sit still. That's all it takes. Every single second that you are not sitting still  you are actively improving the health of your heart  and your lungs and brains. Everybody ready for your next quest  I want you to snap your fingers exactly    times  or count backwards from     by seven  like this         ... Go  Don't give up. Don't let the people counting down from     interfere with your counting to   . Nice. Wow. That's the first time I've ever seen that. Bonus physical resilience. Well done  everyone. Now that's worth    mental resilience  which means you have more mental focus  more discipline  determination and willpower. We know from the scientific research that willpower actually works like a muscle. It gets stronger the more you exercise it. So tackling a tiny challenge without giving up  even one as absurd as snapping your fingers exactly    times or counting backwards from     by seven is actually a scientifically validated way to boost your willpower. So good job. Quest number three. Pick one  Because of the room  fate's really determined this for you  but here are the two options. If you're inside  find a window and look out of it. If you're outside  find a window and look in. Or do a quick YouTube or Google image search for  baby  your favorite animal.   Do it on your phones  or just shout out some baby animals  and I'll put them on the screen. So  what do we want to see  Sloth  giraffe  elephant  snake. Okay  let's see what we got. Baby dolphin and baby llamas. Everybody look. Got that  Okay  one more. Baby elephant. We're clapping for that  That's amazing. All right  what we're just feeling there is plus one emotional resilience  which means you have the ability to provoke powerful  positive emotions like curiosity or love  which we feel looking at baby animals  when you need them most. Here's a secret from the scientific literature for you. If you can manage to experience three positive emotions for every one negative emotion over the course of an hour  a day  a week  you dramatically improve your health and your ability to successfully tackle any problem you're facing. And this is called the three to one positive emotion ratio. It's my favorite SuperBetter trick  so keep it up. All right  pick one  last quest  Shake someone's hand for six seconds  or send someone a quick thank you by text  email  Facebook or Twitter. Go  Looking good  looking good. Nice  nice. Keep it up. I love it  All right  everybody  that is    social resilience  which means you actually get more strength from your friends  your neighbors  your family  your community. Now  a great way to boost social resilience is gratitude. Touch is even better. Here's one more secret for you  Shaking someone's hand for six seconds dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream  now that's the trust hormone. That means that all of you who just shook hands are biochemically primed to like and want to help each other. This will linger during the break  so take advantage of the networking opportunities. Well  you have successfully completed your four quests  let's see if I've successfully completed my mission to give you seven and a half minutes of bonus life. Now I get to share one more little bit of science with you. It turns out that people who regularly boost these four types of resilience    physical  mental  emotional and social    live    years longer than everyone else. So this is true. If you are regularly achieving the three to one positive emotion ratio  if you are never sitting still for more than an hour at a time  if you are reaching out to one person you care about every single day  if you are tackling tiny goals to boost your willpower  you will live    years longer than everyone else  and here's where that math I showed you earlier comes in. So  the average life expectancy in the U.S. and the U.K. is   .  years  but we know from more than       peer reviewed scientific studies that you can add    years of life by boosting your four types of resilience. So every single year that you are boosting your four types of resilience  you're actually earning .    more years of life or    more days of life  or        more minutes of life  which means every single day  you are earning     minutes of life  or every single hour that you are boosting your four types of resilience  like we just did together  you are earning  .         more minutes of life. Congratulations  those seven and a half minutes are all yours. You totally earned them. Yeah  Awesome. Wait  wait  wait. You still have your special mission  your secret mission. How are you going to spend these minutes of bonus life  Well  here's my suggestion. These seven and a half bonus minutes are kind of like genie's wishes. You can use your first wish to wish for a million more wishes. Pretty clever  right  So  if you spend these seven and a half minutes today doing something that makes you happy  or that gets you physically active  or puts you in touch with someone you care about  or even just tackling a tiny challenge  you're going to boost your resilience  so you're going to earn more minutes. And the good news is  you can keep going like that. Every hour of the day  every day of your life  all the way to your deathbed  which will now be    years later than it would have otherwise. And when you get there  more than likely  you will not have any of those top five regrets  because you will have built up the strength and resilience to lead a life truer to your dreams. And with    extra years  you might even have enough time to play a few more games. Thank you. I'm going to start with a little story. So  I grew up in this neighborhood. When I was    years old  I went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete  over four months  slowly wasting away until I was basically a famine victim with an unquenchable thirst. I had basically digested away my body. And this all came to a head when I was on a backpacking trip  my first one ever actually  on Old Rag Mountain in West Virginia  and was putting my face into puddles of water and drinking like a dog. That night  I was taken into the emergency room and diagnosed as a type   diabetic in full blown ketoacidosis. And I recovered  thanks to the miracles of modern medicine  insulin and other things  and gained all my weight back and more. And something festered inside me after this happened. What I thought about was  what caused the diabetes  You see  diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your body fights itself  and at the time people thought that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen and then kill the cells that make insulin. And this is what I thought for a long period of time  and that's in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit  the microbes that do bad things. And that's where I need my assistant here now. You may recognize her. So  I went yesterday  I apologize  I skipped a few of the talks  and I went over to the National Academy of Sciences building  and they sell toys  giant microbes. And here we go  So you have caught flesh eating disease if you caught that one. I gotta get back out my baseball ability here. So  unfortunately or not surprisingly  most of the microbes they sell at the National Academy building are pathogens. Everybody focuses on the things that kill us  and that's what I was focusing on. And it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes  and those microbes actually do us good much of the time  rather than killing us. And so  we've known about this for some period of time. People have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us  I know you're not paying attention to me  but ... The microbes that cover us. And if you look at them in the microscope  you can see that we actually have    times as many cells of microbes on us as we have human cells. There's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain. We are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms. And unfortunately  if you want to learn about the microorganisms  just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient. And so we just heard about the DNA sequencing. It turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes and to understand them is to look at their DNA. And that's what I've been doing for    years  using DNA sequencing  collecting samples from various places  including the human body  reading the DNA sequence and then using that DNA sequencing to tell us about the microbes that are in a particular place. And what's amazing  when you use this technology  for example  looking at humans  we're not just covered in a sea of microbes. There are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us. We have millions of genes of microbes in our human microbiome covering us. And so this microbial diversity differs between people  and what people have been thinking about in the last     maybe    years is  maybe these microbes  this microbial cloud in and on us  and the variation between us  may be responsible for some of the health and illness differences between us. And that comes back to the diabetes story I was telling you. It turns out that people now think that one of the triggers for type   diabetes is not fighting a pathogen  but is in fact trying to    miscommunicating with the microbes that live in and on you. And somehow maybe the microbial community that's in and on me got off  and then this triggered some sort of immune response and led to me killing the cells that make insulin in my body. And so what I want to tell you about for a few minutes is  what people have learned using DNA sequencing techniques in particular  to study the microbial cloud that lives in and on us. And I want to tell you a story about a personal project. My first personal experience with studying the microbes on the human body actually came from a talk that I gave  right around the corner from here at Georgetown. I gave a talk  and a family friend who happened to be the Dean of Georgetown Medical School was at the talk  and came up to me afterwards saying  they were doing a study of ileal transplants in people. And they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants. And so I started a collaboration with this person  Michael Zasloff and Thomas Fishbein  to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient. And I can tell you all the details about the microbial study that we did there  but the reason I want to tell you this story is something really striking that they did at the beginning of this project. They take the donor ileum  which is filled with microbes from a donor and they have a recipient who might have a problem with their microbial community  say Crohn's disease  and they sterilized the donor ileum. Cleaned out all the microbes  and then put it in the recipient. They did this because this was common practice in medicine  even though it was obvious that this was not a good idea. And fortunately  in the course of this project  the transplant surgeons and the other people decided  forget common practice. We have to switch. So they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial community in the ileum. They leave the microbes with the donor  and theoretically that might help the people who are receiving this ileal transplant. And so  people    this is a study that I did now. In the last few years there's been a great expansion in using DNA technology to study the microbes in and on people. There's something called the Human Microbiome Project that's going on in the United States  and MetaHIT going on in Europe  and a lot of other projects. And when people have done a variety of studies  they have learned things such as  when a baby is born  during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the microbes from your mother. There are risk factors associated with cesarean sections  some of those risk factors may be due to mis colonization when you carve a baby out of its mother rather than being delivered through the birth canal. And a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system  helps in fighting off pathogens  helps in our metabolism  and determining our metabolic rate  probably determines our odor  and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways. And so  these studies have documented or suggested out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community  this cloud  the non pathogens that live in and on us. And one area that I think is very interesting  which many of you may have now that we've thrown microbes into the crowd  is something that I would call  germophobia.  So people are really into cleanliness  right  We have antibiotics in our kitchen counters  people are washing every part of them all of the time  we pump antibiotics into our food  into our communities  we take antibiotics excessively. And killing pathogens is a good thing if you're sick  but we should understand that when we pump chemicals and antibiotics into our world  that we're also killing the cloud of microbes that live in and on us. And excessive use of antibiotics  in particular in children  has been shown to be associated with  again  risk factors for obesity  for autoimmune diseases  for a variety of problems that are probably due to disruption of the microbial community. So the microbial community can go wrong whether we want it to or not  or we can kill it with antibiotics  but what can we do to restore it  I'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics. Probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore the microbial community that is in and on you. And they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases. There's a project going on at UC Davis where people are using probiotics to try and treat  prevent  necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants. Premature infants have real problems with their microbial community. And it may be that probiotics can help prevent the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis in these premature infants. But probiotics are sort of a very  very simple solution. Most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat have one or two species in them  maybe five species in them  and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species. So what can we do to restore our microbial community when we have thousands and thousands of species on us  Well  one thing that animals seem to do is  they eat poo    coprophagia. And it turns out that many veterinarians  old school veterinarians in particular  have been doing something called  poo tea   not booty  but poo tea  to treat colic and other ailments in horses and cows and things like that  where you make tea from the poo from a healthy individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal. Although  unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side  and you can put your hand into its rumen  it's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes directly into the mouth and through the entire top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system  so you may have heard in people they are now doing fecal transplants  where rather than delivering a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth  they are delivering a community of probiotics  a community of microbes from a healthy donor  through the other end. And this has turned out to be very effective in fighting certain intransigent infectious diseases like Clostridium difficile infections that can stay with people for years and years and years. Transplants of the feces  of the microbes from the feces  from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure systemic C. dif infections in some people. Now what these transplants  these fecal transplants  or the poo tea suggest to me  and many other people have come up with this same idea  is that the microbial community in and on us  it's an organ. We should view it as a functioning organ  part of ourselves. We should treat it carefully and with respect  and we do not want to mess with it  say by C sections or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness  without some real good justification. And what the DNA sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now is do detailed studies of  say      patients who have Crohn's disease and     people who don't have Crohn's disease. Or     people who took antibiotics when they were little  and     people who did not take antibiotics. And we can now start to compare the community of microbes and their genes and see if there are differences. And eventually we may be able to understand if they're not just correlative differences  but causative. Studies in model systems like mouse and other animals are also helping do this  but people are now using these technologies because they've gotten very cheap  to study the microbes in and on a variety of people. So  in wrapping up  what I want to tell you about is  I didn't tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes. It turns out that my father was an M.D.  actually studied hormones. I told him many times that I was tired  thirsty  not feeling very good. And he shrugged it off  I think he either thought I was just complaining a lot  or it was the typical M.D.  nothing can be wrong with my children.  We even went to the International Society of Endocrinology meeting as family in Quebec. And I was getting up every five minutes to pee  and drinking everybody's water at the table  and I think they all thought I was a druggie. But the reason I'm telling you this is that the medical community  my father as an example  sometimes doesn't see what's right in front of their eyes. The microbial cloud  it is right in front of us. We can't see it most of the time. It's invisible. They're microbes. They're tiny. But we can see them through their DNA  we can see them through the effects that they have on people. And what we need now is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context of everything in human medicine. It doesn't mean that it affects every part of us  but it might. What we need is a full field guide to the microbes that live in and on people  so that we can understand what they're doing to our lives. We are them. They are us. Thank you. So  how many of you have ever gotten behind the wheel of a car when you really shouldn't have been driving  Maybe you're out on the road for a long day  and you just wanted to get home. You were tired  but you felt you could drive a few more miles. Maybe you thought  I've had less to drink than everybody else  I should be the one to go home. Or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere. Does this sound familiar to you  Now  in those situations  wouldn't it be great if there was a button on your dashboard that you could push  and the car would get you home safely  Now  that's been the promise of the self driving car  the autonomous vehicle  and it's been the dream since at least       when General Motors showcased this idea at their Futurama booth at the World's Fair. Now  it's been one of those dreams that's always seemed about    years in the future. Now  two weeks ago  that dream took a step forward  when the state of Nevada granted Google's self driving car the very first license for an autonomous vehicle  clearly establishing that it's legal for them to test it on the roads in Nevada. Now  California's considering similar legislation  and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in Vegas. Now  in my lab at Stanford  we've been working on autonomous cars too  but with a slightly different spin on things. You see  we've been developing robotic race cars  cars that can actually push themselves to the very limits of physical performance. Now  why would we want to do such a thing  Well  there's two really good reasons for this. First  we believe that before people turn over control to an autonomous car  that autonomous car should be at least as good as the very best human drivers. Now  if you're like me  and the other    percent of the population who know that we are above average drivers  you understand that's a very high bar. There's another reason as well. Just like race car drivers can use all of the friction between the tire and the road  all of the car's capabilities to go as fast as possible  we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid any accident we can. Now  you may push the car to the limits not because you're driving too fast  but because you've hit an icy patch of road  conditions have changed. In those situations  we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physically be avoided. I must confess  there's kind of a third motivation as well. You see  I have a passion for racing. In the past  I've been a race car owner  a crew chief and a driving coach  although maybe not at the level that you're currently expecting. One of the things that we've developed in the lab    we've developed several vehicles    is what we believe is the world's first autonomously drifting car. It's another one of those categories where maybe there's not a lot of competition. But this is P . It's an entirely student built electric vehicle  which through using its rear wheel drive and front wheel steer by wire can drift around corners. It can get sideways like a rally car driver  always able to take the tightest curve  even on slippery  changing surfaces  never spinning out. We've also worked with Volkswagen Oracle  on Shelley  an autonomous race car that has raced at     miles an hour through the Bonneville Salt Flats  gone around Thunderhill Raceway Park in the sun  the wind and the rain  and navigated the     turns and   .  miles of the Pikes Peak Hill Climb route in Colorado with nobody at the wheel. I guess it goes without saying that we've had a lot of fun doing this. But in fact  there's something else that we've developed in the process of developing these autonomous cars. We have developed a tremendous appreciation for the capabilities of human race car drivers. As we've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform  we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts. And we discovered their human counterparts are amazing. Now  we can take a map of a race track  we can take a mathematical model of a car  and with some iteration  we can actually find the fastest way around that track. We line that up with data that we record from a professional driver  and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable. Yes  there are subtle differences here  but the human race car driver is able to go out and drive an amazingly fast line  without the benefit of an algorithm that compares the trade off between going as fast as possible in this corner  and shaving a little bit of time off of the straight over here. Not only that  they're able to do it lap after lap after lap. They're able to go out and consistently do this  pushing the car to the limits every single time. It's extraordinary to watch. You put them in a new car  and after a few laps  they've found the fastest line in that car  and they're off to the races. It really makes you think  we'd love to know what's going on inside their brain. So as researchers  that's what we decided to find out. We decided to instrument not only the car  but also the race car driver  to try to get a glimpse into what was going on in their head as they were doing this. Now  this is Dr. Lene Harbott applying electrodes to the head of John Morton. John Morton is a former Can Am and IMSA driver  who's also a class champion at Le Mans. Fantastic driver  and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research. She's putting electrodes on his head so that we can monitor the electrical activity in John's brain as he races around the track. Now  clearly we're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track. However  neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this. For instance  the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves. In contrast  theta waves are associated with a lot of cognitive activity  like visual processing  things where the driver is thinking quite a bit. Now  we can measure this  and we can look at the relative power between the theta waves and the alpha waves. This gives us a measure of mental workload  how much the driver is actually challenged cognitively at any point along the track. Now  we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track  so we headed down south to Laguna Seca. Laguna Seca is a legendary raceway about halfway between Salinas and Monterey. It has a curve there called the Corkscrew. Now  the Corkscrew is a chicane  followed by a quick right handed turn as the road drops three stories. Now  the strategy for driving this as explained to me was  you aim for the bush in the distance  and as the road falls away  you realize it was actually the top of a tree. All right  so thanks to the Revs Program at Stanford  we were able to take John there and put him behind the wheel of a      Porsche Abarth Carrera. Life is way too short for boring cars. So  here you see John on the track  he's going up the hill    Oh  Somebody liked that    and you can see  actually  his mental workload    measuring here in the red bar    you can see his actions as he approaches. Now watch  he has to downshift. And then he has to turn left. Look for the tree  and down. Not surprisingly  you can see this is a pretty challenging task. You can see his mental workload spike as he goes through this  as you would expect with something that requires this level of complexity. But what's really interesting is to look at areas of the track where his mental workload doesn't increase. I'm going to take you around now to the other side of the track. Turn three. And John's going to go into that corner and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out. He's going to have to correct for that with steering. So watch as John does this here. Watch the mental workload  and watch the steering. The car begins to slide out  dramatic maneuver to correct it  and no change whatsoever in the mental workload. Not a challenging task. In fact  entirely reflexive. Now  our data processing on this is still preliminary  but it really seems that these phenomenal feats that the race car drivers are performing are instinctive. They are things that they have simply learned to do. It requires very little mental workload for them to perform these amazing feats. And their actions are fantastic. This is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel to catch the car in this situation. Now  this has given us tremendous insight and inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles. We've started to ask the question  Can we make them a little less algorithmic and a little more intuitive  Can we take this reflexive action that we see from the very best race car drivers  introduce it to our cars  and maybe even into a system that could get onto your car in the future  That would take us a long step along the road to autonomous vehicles that drive as well as the best humans. But it's made us think a little bit more deeply as well. Do we want something more from our car than to simply be a chauffeur  Do we want our car to perhaps be a partner  a coach  someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential  Can  in fact  the technology not simply replace humans  but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition that we're all capable of  So  as we move forward into this technological future  I want you to just pause and think of that for a moment. What is the ideal balance of human and machine  And as we think about that  let's take inspiration from the absolutely amazing capabilities of the human body and the human mind. Thank you. I study the future of crime and terrorism  and frankly  I'm afraid. I'm afraid by what I see. I sincerely want to believe that technology can bring us the techno utopia that we've been promised  but  you see  I've spent a career in law enforcement  and that's informed my perspective on things. I've been a street police officer  an undercover investigator  a counter terrorism strategist  and I've worked in more than    countries around the world. I've had to see more than my fair share of violence and the darker underbelly of society  and that's informed my opinions. My work with criminals and terrorists has actually been highly educational. They have taught me a lot  and I'd like to be able to share some of these observations with you. Today I'm going to show you the flip side of all those technologies that we marvel at  the ones that we love. In the hands of the TED community  these are awesome tools which will bring about great change for our world  but in the hands of suicide bombers  the future can look quite different. I started observing technology and how criminals were using it as a young patrol officer. In those days  this was the height of technology. Laugh though you will  all the drug dealers and gang members with whom I dealt had one of these long before any police officer I knew did. Twenty years later  criminals are still using mobile phones  but they're also building their own mobile phone networks  like this one  which has been deployed in all    states of Mexico by the narcos. They have a national encrypted radio communications system. Think about that. Think about the innovation that went into that. Think about the infrastructure to build it. And then think about this  Why can't I get a cell phone signal in San Francisco   Laughter  How is this possible   Laughter  It makes no sense.  Applause  We consistently underestimate what criminals and terrorists can do. Technology has made our world increasingly open  and for the most part  that's great  but all of this openness may have unintended consequences. Consider the      terrorist attack on Mumbai. The men that carried that attack out were armed with AK   s  explosives and hand grenades. They threw these hand grenades at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes and waited to catch trains on their way home from work. But heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations. Guns and bombs are nothing new. What was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims and slaughter them. They were armed with mobile phones. They had BlackBerries. They had access to satellite imagery. They had satellite phones  and they even had night vision goggles. But perhaps their greatest innovation was this. We've all seen pictures like this on television and in the news. This is an operations center. And the terrorists built their very own op center across the border in Pakistan  where they monitored the BBC  al Jazeera  CNN and Indian local stations. They also monitored the Internet and social media to monitor the progress of their attacks and how many people they had killed. They did all of this in real time. The innovation of the terrorist operations center gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness and tactical advantage over the police and over the government. What did they do with this  They used it to great effect. At one point during the    hour siege  the terrorists were going room to room trying to find additional victims. They came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel  and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed. And they said to him   Who are you  and what are you doing here   And the man replied   I'm just an innocent schoolteacher.  Of course  the terrorists knew that no Indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the Taj. They picked up his identification  and they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room  where the terrorist war room Googled him  and found a picture and called their operatives on the ground and said   Your hostage  is he heavyset  Is he bald in front  Does he wear glasses    Yes  yes  yes   came the answers. The op center had found him and they had a match. He was not a schoolteacher. He was the second wealthiest businessman in India  and after discovering this information  the terrorist war room gave the order to the terrorists on the ground in Mumbai. We all worry about our privacy settings on Facebook  but the fact of the matter is  our openness can be used against us. Terrorists are doing this. A search engine can determine who shall live and who shall die. This is the world that we live in. During the Mumbai siege  terrorists were so dependent on technology that several witnesses reported that as the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand  they were checking their mobile phone messages in the very other hand. In the end      people were gravely wounded and over     men  women and children lost their lives that day. Think about what happened. During this    hour siege on Mumbai     men armed not just with weapons  but with technology  were able to bring a city of    million people to a standstill. Ten people brought    million people to a standstill  and this traveled around the world. This is what radicals can do with openness. This was done nearly four years ago. What could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have  What will they do tomorrow  The ability of one to affect many is scaling exponentially  and it's scaling for good and it's scaling for evil. It's not just about terrorism  though. There's also been a big paradigm shift in crime. You see  you can now commit more crime as well. In the old days  it was a knife and a gun. Then criminals moved to robbing trains. You could rob     people on a train  a great innovation. Moving forward  the Internet allowed things to scale even more. In fact  many of you will remember the recent Sony PlayStation hack. In that incident  over     million people were robbed. Think about that. When in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob     million  Of course  it's not just about stealing things. There are other avenues of technology that criminals can exploit. Many of you will remember this super cute video from the last TED  but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute. They don't all have drumsticks. Some can be armed with HD cameras and do countersurveillance on protesters  or  as in this little bit of movie magic  quadcopters can be loaded with firearms and automatic weapons. Little robots are cute when they play music to you. When they swarm and chase you down the block to shoot you  a little bit less so. Of course  criminals and terrorists weren't the first to give guns to robots. We know where that started. But they're adapting quickly. Recently  the FBI arrested an al Qaeda affiliate in the United States  who was planning on using these remote controlled drone aircraft to fly C  explosives into government buildings in the United States. By the way  these travel at over     miles an hour. Every time a new technology is being introduced  criminals are there to exploit it. We've all seen  D printers. We know with them that you can print in many materials ranging from plastic to chocolate to metal and even concrete. With great precision I actually was able to make this just the other day  a very cute little ducky. But I wonder to myself  for those people that strap bombs to their chests and blow themselves up  how might they use  D printers  Perhaps like this. You see  if you can print in metal  you can print one of these  and in fact you can also print one of these too. The UK I know has some very strict firearms laws. You needn't bring the gun into the UK anymore. You just bring the  D printer and print the gun while you're here  and  of course  the magazines for your bullets. But as these get bigger in the future  what other items will you be able to print  The technologies are allowing bigger printers. As we move forward  we'll see new technologies also  like the Internet of Things. Every day we're connecting more and more of our lives to the Internet  which means that the Internet of Things will soon be the Internet of Things To Be Hacked. All of the physical objects in our space are being transformed into information technologies  and that has a radical implication for our security  because more connections to more devices means more vulnerabilities. Criminals understand this. Terrorists understand this. Hackers understand this. If you control the code  you control the world. This is the future that awaits us. There has not yet been an operating system or a technology that hasn't been hacked. That's troubling  since the human body itself is now becoming an information technology. As we've seen here  we're transforming ourselves into cyborgs. Every year  thousands of cochlear implants  diabetic pumps  pacemakers and defibrillators are being implanted in people. In the United States  there are        people who have a pacemaker that connects to the Internet. The defibrillators allow a physician at a distance to give a shock to a heart in case a patient needs it. But if you don't need it  and somebody else gives you the shock  it's not a good thing. Of course  we're going to go even deeper than the human body. We're going down to the cellular level these days. Up until this point  all the technologies I've been talking about have been silicon based  ones and zeroes  but there's another operating system out there  the original operating system  DNA. And to hackers  DNA is just another operating system waiting to be hacked. It's a great challenge for them. There are people already working on hacking the software of life  and while most of them are doing this to great good and to help us all  some won't be. So how will criminals abuse this  Well  with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things. For example  I predict that we will move away from a plant based narcotics world to a synthetic one. Why do you need the plants anymore  You can just take the DNA code from marijuana or poppies or coca leaves and cut and past that gene and put it into yeast  and you can take those yeast and make them make the cocaine for you  or the marijuana  or any other drug. So how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting. In fact  we may have some really interesting bread and beer as we go into this next century. The cost of sequencing the human genome is dropping precipitously. It was proceeding at Moore's Law pace  but then in       something changed. The technologies got better  and now DNA sequencing is proceeding at a pace five times that of Moore's Law. That has significant implications for us. It took us    years to get from the introduction of the personal computer to the level of cybercrime we have today  but looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly  and knowing criminals and terrorists as I do  we may get there a lot faster with biocrime in the future. It will be easy for anybody to go ahead and print their own bio virus  enhanced versions of ebola or anthrax  weaponized flu. We recently saw a case where some researchers made the H N  avian influenza virus more potent. It already has a    percent mortality rate if you get it  but it's hard to get. Engineers  by moving around a small number of genetic changes  were able to weaponize it and make it much more easy for human beings to catch  so that not thousands of people would die  but tens of millions. You see  you can go ahead and create new pandemics  and the researchers who did this were so proud of their accomplishments  they wanted to publish it openly so that everybody could see this and get access to this information. But it goes deeper than that. DNA researcher Andrew Hessel has pointed out quite rightly that if you can use cancer treatments  modern cancer treatments  to go after one cell while leaving all the other cells around it intact  then you can also go after any one person's cell. Personalized cancer treatments are the flip side of personalized bioweapons  which means you can attack any one individual  including all the people in this picture. How will we protect them in the future  What to do  What to do about all this  That's what I get asked all the time. For those of you who follow me on Twitter  I will be tweeting out the answer later on today.  Laughter  Actually  it's a bit more complex than that  and there are no magic bullets. I don't have all the answers  but I know a few things. In the wake of       the best security minds put together all their innovation and this is what they created for security. If you're expecting the people who built this to protect you from the coming robopocalypse    Laughter    uh  you may want to have a backup plan.  Laughter  Just saying. Just think about that.  Applause  Law enforcement is currently a closed system. It's nation based  while the threat is international. Policing doesn't scale globally. At least  it hasn't  and our current system of guns  border guards  big gates and fences are outdated in the new world into which we're moving. So how might we prepare for some of these specific threats  like attacking a president or a prime minister  This would be the natural government response  to hide away all our government leaders in hermetically sealed bubbles. But this is not going to work. The cost of doing a DNA sequence is going to be trivial. Anybody will have it and we will all have them in the future. So maybe there's a more radical way that we can look at this. What happens if we were to take the President's DNA  or a king or queen's  and put it out to a group of a few hundred trusted researchers so they could study that DNA and do penetration testing against it as a means of helping our leaders  Or what if we sent it out to a few thousand  Or  controversially  and not without its risks  what happens if we just gave it to the whole public  Then we could all be engaged in helping. We've already seen examples of this working well. The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project is staffed by journalists and citizens where they are crowd sourcing what dictators and terrorists are doing with public funds around the world  and  in a more dramatic case  we've seen in Mexico  a country that has been racked by        narcotics related murders in the past six years. They're killing so many people they can't even afford to bury them all in anything but these unmarked graves like this one outside of Ciudad Juarez. What can we do about this  The government has proven ineffective. So in Mexico  citizens  at great risk to themselves  are fighting back to build an effective solution. They're crowd mapping the activities of the drug dealers. Whether or not you realize it  we are at the dawn of a technological arms race  an arms race between people who are using technology for good and those who are using it for ill. The threat is serious  and the time to prepare for it is now. I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are. My personal belief is that  rather than having a small  elite force of highly trained government agents here to protect us all  we're much better off having average and ordinary citizens approaching this problem as a group and seeing what we can do. If we all do our part  I think we'll be in a much better space. The tools to change the world are in everybody's hands. How we use them is not just up to me  it's up to all of us. This was a technology I would frequently deploy as a police officer. This technology has become outdated in our current world. It doesn't scale  it doesn't work globally  and it surely doesn't work virtually. We've seen paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism. They call for a shift to a more open form and a more participatory form of law enforcement. So I invite you to join me. After all  public safety is too important to leave to the professionals. Thank you.  Applause  My passions are music  technology and making things. And it's the combination of these things that has led me to the hobby of sound visualization  and  on occasion  has led me to play with fire. This is a Rubens' tube. It's one of many I've made over the years  and I have one here tonight. It's about an   foot long tube of metal  it's got a hundred or so holes on top  on that side is the speaker  and here is some lab tubing  and it's connected to this tank of propane. So  let's fire it up and see what it does. So let's play a     herz frequency and watch what happens. Thank you.  Applause  It's okay to applaud the laws of physics  but essentially what's happening here     Laughter     is the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules is influencing the combustion properties of propane  creating a visible waveform  and we can see the alternating regions of compression and rarefaction that we call frequency  and the height is showing us amplitude. So let's change the frequency of the sound  and watch what happens to the fire. So every time we hit a resonant frequency we get a standing wave and that emergent sine curve of fire. So let's turn that off. We're indoors. Thank you.  Applause  I also have with me a flame table. It's very similar to a Rubens' tube  and it's also used for visualizing the physical properties of sound  such as eigenmodes  so let's fire it up and see what it does. Ooh.  Laughter  Okay. Now  while the table comes up to pressure  let me note here that the sound is not traveling in perfect lines. It's actually traveling in all directions  and the Rubens' tube's a little like bisecting those waves with a line  and the flame table's a little like bisecting those waves with a plane  and it can show a little more subtle complexity  which is why I like to use it to watch Geoff Farina play guitar. All right  so it's a delicate dance. If you watch closely    Applause  If you watch closely  you may have seen some of the eigenmodes  but also you may have seen that jazz music is better with fire. Actually  a lot of things are better with fire in my world  but the fire's just a foundation. It shows very well that eyes can hear  and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound  such as the removal of time. So here  I'm using a rendering algorithm to paint the frequencies of the song  Smells Like Teen Spirit  in a way that the eyes can take them in as a single visual impression  and the technique will also show the strengths of the visual cortex for pattern recognition. So if I show you another song off this album  and another  your eyes will easily pick out the use of repetition by the band Nirvana  and in the frequency distribution  the colors  you can see the clean dirty clean sound that they are famous for  and here is the entire album as a single visual impression  and I think this impression is pretty powerful. At least  it's powerful enough that if I show you these four songs  and I remind you that this is  Smells Like Teen Spirit   you can probably correctly guess  without listening to any music at all  that the song a die hard Nirvana fan would enjoy is this song   I'll Stick Around  by the Foo Fighters  whose lead singer is Dave Grohl  who was the drummer in Nirvana. The songs are a little similar  but mostly I'm just interested in the idea that someday maybe we'll buy a song because we like the way it looks. All right  now for some more sound data. This is data from a skate park  and this is Mabel Davis skate park in Austin  Texas.  Skateboard sounds  And the sounds you're hearing came from eight microphones attached to obstacles around the park  and it sounds like chaos  but actually all the tricks start with a very distinct slap  but successful tricks end with a pop  whereas unsuccessful tricks more of a scratch and a tumble  and tricks on the rail will ring out like a gong  and voices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park. So if we were to render these sounds visually  we might end up with something like this. This is all    minutes of the recording  and right away the algorithm tells us a lot more tricks are missed than are made  and also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely to produce a cheer  and if you look really closely  we can tease out traffic patterns. You see the skaters often trick in this direction. The obstacles are easier. And in the middle of the recording  the mics pick this up  but later in the recording  this kid shows up  and he starts using a line at the top of the park to do some very advanced tricks on something called the tall rail. And it's fascinating. At this moment in time  all the rest of the skaters turn their lines    degrees to stay out of his way. You see  there's a subtle etiquette in the skate park  and it's led by key influencers  and they tend to be the kids who can do the best tricks  or wear red pants  and on this day the mics picked that up. All right  from skate physics to theoretical physics. I'm a big fan of Stephen Hawking  and I wanted to use all eight hours of his Cambridge lecture series to create an homage. Now  in this series he's speaking with the aid of a computer  which actually makes identifying the ends of sentences fairly easy. So I wrote a steering algorithm. It listens to the lecture  and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x axis  and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y axis. And these trend lines  you can see  there's more questions than answers in the laws of physics  and when we reach the end of a sentence  we place a star at that location. So there's a lot of sentences  so a lot of stars  and after rendering all of the audio  this is what we get. This is Stephen Hawking's universe. It's all eight hours of the Cambridge lecture series taken in as a single visual impression  and I really like this image  but a lot of people think it's fake. So I made a more interactive version  and the way I did that is I used their position in time in the lecture to place these stars into  D space  and with some custom software and a Kinect  I can walk right into the lecture. I'm going to wave through the Kinect here and take control  and now I'm going to reach out and I'm going to touch a star  and when I do  it will play the sentence that generated that star. Stephen Hawking  There is one  and only one  arrangement in which the pieces make a complete picture. Jared Ficklin  Thank you.  Applause  There are       stars. It's a really fun way to explore the lecture  and  I hope  a fitting homage. All right. Let me close with a work in progress. I think  after    years  the opportunity exists to create an enhanced version of closed captioning. Now  we've all seen a lot of TEDTalks online  so let's watch one now with the sound turned off and the closed captioning turned on. There's no closed captioning for the TED theme song  and we're missing it  but if you've watched enough of these  you hear it in your mind's ear  and then applause starts. It usually begins here  and it grows and then it falls. Sometimes you get a little star applause  and then I think even Bill Gates takes a nervous breath  and the talk begins. All right  so let's watch this clip again. This time  I'm not going to talk at all. There's still going to be no audio  but what I am going to do is I'm going to render the sound visually in real time at the bottom of the screen. So watch closely and see what your eyes can hear. This is fairly amazing to me. Even on the first view  your eyes will successfully pick out patterns  but on repeated views  your brain actually gets better at turning these patterns into information. You can get the tone and the timbre and the pace of the speech  things that you can't get out of closed captioning. That famous scene in horror movies where someone is walking up from behind is something you can see  and I believe this information would be something that is useful at times when the audio is turned off or not heard at all  and I speculate that deaf audiences might actually even be better at seeing sound than hearing audiences. I don't know. It's a theory right now. Actually  it's all just an idea. And let me end by saying that sound moves in all directions  and so do ideas. Thank you.  Applause  Something happened in the early morning hours of May  nd        that had a profound effect on the way our society operates. Ironically  hardly anyone noticed at the time. The change was silent  imperceptible  unless you knew exactly what to look for. On that morning  U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered that a special switch be thrown in the orbiting satellites of the Global Positioning System. Instantaneously  every civilian GPS receiver around the globe went from errors the size of a football field to errors the size of a small room. It's hard to overstate the effect that this change in accuracy has had on us. Before this switch was thrown  we didn't have in car navigation systems giving turn by turn directions  because back then  GPS couldn't tell you what block you were on  let alone what street. For geolocation  accuracy matters  and things have only improved over the last    years. With more base stations  more ground stations  better receivers and better algorithms  GPS can now not only tell you what street you are on  but what part of the street. This level of accuracy has unleashed a firestorm of innovation. In fact  many of you navigated here today with the help of your TomTom or your smartphone. Paper maps are becoming obsolete. But we now stand on the verge of another revolution in geolocation accuracy. What if I told you that the two meter positioning that our current cell phones and our TomToms give us is pathetic compared to what we could be getting  For some time now  it's been known that if you pay attention to the carrier phase of the GPS signal  and if you have an Internet connection  then you can go from meter level to centimeter level  even millimeter level positioning. So why don't we have this capability on our phones  Only  I believe  for a lack of imagination. Manufacturers haven't built this carrier phase technique into their cheap GPS chips because they're not sure what the general public would do with geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint the wrinkles in the palm of your hand. But you and I and other innovators  we can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy. Imagine  for example  an augmented reality app that overlays a virtual world to millimeter level precision on top of the physical world. I could build for you a structure up here in  D  millimeter accurate  that only you could see  or my friends at home. So this level of positioning  this is what we're looking for  and I believe that  within the next few years  I predict  that this kind of hyper precise  carrier phase based positioning will become cheap and ubiquitous  and the consequences will be fantastic. The Holy Grail  of course  is the GPS dot. Do you remember the movie  The Da Vinci Code   Here's Professor Langdon examining a GPS dot  which his accomplice tells him is a tracking device accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe  but we know that in the world of nonfiction  the GPS dot is impossible  right  For one thing  GPS doesn't work indoors  and for another  they don't make devices quite this small  especially when those devices have to relay their measurements back over a network. Well  these objections were perfectly reasonable a few years ago  but things have changed. There's been a strong trend toward miniaturization  better sensitivity  so much so that  a few years ago  a GPS tracking device looked like this clunky box to the left of the keys. Compare that with the device released just months ago that's now packaged into something the size of a key fob  and if you take a look at the state of the art for a complete GPS receiver  which is only a centimeter on a side and more sensitive than ever  you realize that the GPS dot will soon move from fiction to nonfiction. Imagine what we could do with a world full of GPS dots. It's not just that you'll never lose your wallet or your keys anymore  or your child when you're at Disneyland. You'll buy GPS dots in bulk  and you'll stick them on everything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars. I couldn't find my shoes one recent morning  and  as usual  had to ask my wife if she had seen them. But I shouldn't have to bother my wife with that kind of triviality. I should be able to ask my house where my shoes are. Those of you who have made the switch to Gmail  remember how refreshing it was to go from organizing all of your email to simply searching it. The GPS dot will do the same for our possessions. Now  of course  there is a flip side to the GPS dot. I was in my office some months back and got a telephone call. The woman on the other end of the line  we'll call her Carol  was panicked. Apparently  an ex boyfriend of Carol's from California had found her in Texas and was following her around. So you might ask at this point why she's calling you. Well  so did I. But it turned out there was a technical twist to Carol's case. Every time her ex boyfriend would show up  at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations  he was carrying an open laptop  and over time Carol realized that he had planted a GPS tracking device on her car  so she was calling me for help to disable it.  Well  you should go to a good mechanic and have him look at your car   I said.  I already have   she told me.  He didn't see anything obvious  and he said he'd have to take the car apart piece by piece.   Well then  you'd better go to the police   I said.  I already have   she replied.  They're not sure this rises to the level of harassment  and they're not set up technically to find the device.   Okay  what about the FBI    I've talked to them too  and same story.  We then talked about her coming to my lab and us performing a radio sweep of her car  but I wasn't even sure that would work  given that some of these devices are configured to only transmit when they're inside safe zones or when the car is moving. So  there we were. Carol isn't the first  and certainly won't be the last  to find herself in this kind of fearsome environment  worrisome situation caused by GPS tracking. In fact  as I looked into her case  I discovered to my surprise that it's not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else's car. The Supreme Court ruled last month that a policeman has to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking  but the law isn't clear about civilians doing this to one another  so it's not just Big Brother we have to worry about  but Big Neighbor.  Laughter  There is one alternative that Carol could have taken  very effective. It's called the Wave Bubble. It's an open source GPS jammer  developed by Limor Fried  a graduate student at MIT  and Limor calls it  a tool for reclaiming our personal space.  With a flip of the switch you create a bubble around you within which GPS signals can't reside. They get drowned out by the bubble. And Limor designed this  in part  because  like Carol  she felt threatened by GPS tracking. Then she posted her design to the web  and if you don't have time to build your own  you can buy one. Chinese manufacturers now sell thousands of nearly identical devices on the Internet. So you might be thinking  the Wave Bubble sounds great. I should have one. Might come in handy if somebody ever puts a tracking device on my car. But you should be aware that its use is very much illegal in the United States. And why is that  Well  because it's not a bubble at all. Its jamming signals don't stop at the edge of your personal space or at the edge of your car. They go on to jam innocent GPS receivers for miles around you.  Laughter  Now  if you're Carol or Limor  or someone who feels threatened by GPS tracking  it might not feel wrong to turn on a Wave Bubble  but in fact  the results can be disastrous. Imagine  for example  you're the captain of a cruise ship trying to make your way through a thick fog and some passenger in the back turns on a Wave Bubble. All of a sudden your GPS readout goes blank  and now it's just you and the fog and whatever you can pull off the radar system if you remember how to work it. They    in fact  they don't update or upkeep lighthouses anymore  and LORAN  the only backup to GPS  was discontinued last year. Our modern society has a special relationship with GPS. We're almost blindly reliant on it. It's built deeply into our systems and infrastructure. Some call it  the invisible utility.  So  turning on a Wave Bubble might not just cause inconvenience. It might be deadly. But as it turns out  for purposes of protecting your privacy at the expense of general GPS reliability  there's something even more potent and more subversive than a Wave Bubble  and that is a GPS spoofer. The idea behind the GPS spoofer is simple. Instead of jamming the GPS signals  you fake them. You imitate them  and if you do it right  the device you're attacking doesn't even know it's being spoofed. So let me show you how this works. In any GPS receiver  there's a peak inside that corresponds to the authentic signals. These three red dots represent the tracking points that try to keep themselves centered on that peak. But if you send in a fake GPS signal  another peak pops up  and if you can get these two peaks perfectly aligned  the tracking points can't tell the difference  and they get hijacked by the stronger counterfeit signal  with the authentic peak getting forced off. At this point  the game is over. The fake signals now completely control this GPS receiver. So is this really possible  Can someone really manipulate the timing and positioning of a GPS receiver just like that  with a spoofer  Well  the short answer is yes. The key is that civil GPS signals are completely open. They have no encryption. They have no authentication. They're wide open  vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack. Even so  up until very recently  nobody worried about GPS spoofers. People figured that it would be too complex or too expensive for some hacker to build one. But I  and a friend of mine from graduate school  we didn't see it that way. We knew it wasn't going to be so hard  and we wanted to be the first to build one so we could get out in front of the problem and help protect against GPS spoofing. I remember vividly the week it all came together. We built it at my home  which means that I got a little extra help from my three year old son Ramon. Here's Ramon    Laughter    looking for a little attention from Dad that week. At first  the spoofer was just a jumble of cables and computers  though we eventually got it packaged into a small box. Now  the Dr. Frankenstein moment  when the spoofer finally came alive and I glimpsed its awful potential  came late one night when I tested the spoofer against my iPhone. Let me show you some actual footage from that very first experiment. I had come to completely trust this little blue dot and its reassuring blue halo. They seemed to speak to me. They'd say   Here you are. Here you are.   Laughter  And  you can trust us.  So something felt very wrong about the world. It was a sense  almost  of betrayal  when this little blue dot started at my house  and went running off toward the north leaving me behind. I wasn't moving. What I then saw in this little moving blue dot was the potential for chaos. I saw airplanes and ships veering off course  with the captain learning only too late that something was wrong. I saw the GPS derived timing of the New York Stock Exchange being manipulated by hackers. You can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc you could cause if you knew what you were doing with a GPS spoofer. There is  though  one redeeming feature of the GPS spoofer. It's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of GPS dots. Imagine  for example  you're being tracked. Well  you can play the tracker for a fool  pretending to be at work when you're really on vacation. Or  if you're Carol  you could lure your ex boyfriend into some empty parking lot where the police are waiting for him. So I'm fascinated by this conflict  a looming conflict  between privacy on the one hand and the need for a clean radio spectrum on the other. We simply cannot tolerate GPS jammers and spoofers  and yet  given the lack of effective legal means for protecting our privacy from the GPS dot  can you really blame people for wanting to turn them on  for wanting to use them  I hold out hope that we'll be able to reconcile this conflict with some sort of  some yet uninvented technology. But meanwhile  grab some popcorn  because things are going to get interesting. Within the next few years  many of you will be the proud owner of a GPS dot. Maybe you'll have a whole bag full of them. You'll never lose track of your things again. The GPS dot will fundamentally reorder your life. But will you be able to resist the temptation to track your fellow man  Or will you be able to resist the temptation to turn on a GPS spoofer or a Wave Bubble to protect your own privacy  So  as usual  what we see just beyond the horizon is full of promise and peril. It'll be fascinating to see how this all turns out. Thanks.  Applause  I love to collect things. Ever since I was a kid  I've had massive collections of random stuff  everything from bizarre hot sauces from all around the world to insects that I've captured and put in jars. Now  it's no secret  because I like collecting things  that I love the Natural History Museum and the collections of animals at the Natural History Museum in dioramas. These  to me  are like living sculptures  right  that you can go and look at  and they memorialize a specific point of time in this animal's life. So I was thinking about my own life  and how I'd like to memorialize my life  you know  for the ages  and also    Laughter    the lives of my friends  but the problem with this is that my friends aren't quite keen on the idea of me taxidermy ing them.  Laughter  So instead  I turned to video  and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize someone and to capture a specific moment in time. So what I did was  I filmed six of my friends and then  using video mapping and video projection  I created a video sculpture  which was these six friends projected into jars.  Laughter  So now I have this collection of my friends I can take around with me whenever I go  and this is called Animalia Chordata  from the Latin nomenclature for human being  classification system. So this piece memorializes my friends in these jars  and they actually move around.  Laughter  So  this is interesting to me  but it lacked a certain human element.  Laughter  It's a digital sculpture  so I wanted to add an interaction system. So what I did was  I added a proximity sensor  so that when you get close to the people in jars  they react to you in different ways. You know  just like people on the street when you get too close to them. Some people reacted in terror.  Laughter  Others reacted in asking you for help  and some people hide from you. So this was really interesting to me  this idea of taking video off the screen and putting it in real life  and also adding interactivity to sculpture. So over the next year  I documented    of my other friends and trapped them in jars as well and created a piece known as Garden  which is literally a garden of humanity. But something about the first piece  the Animali Chordata piece  kept coming back to me  this idea of interaction with art  and I really liked the idea of people being able to interact  and also being challenged by interacting with art. So I wanted to create a new piece that actually forced people to come and interact with something  and the way I did this was actually by projecting a     s housewife into a blender.  Laughter  This is a piece called Blend  and what it does is it actually makes you implicit in the work of art. You may never experience the entire thing yourself. You can walk away  you can just watch as this character stands there in the blender and looks at you  or you can actually choose to interact with it. So if you do choose to interact with the piece  and you press the blender button  it actually sends this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment. By doing that  you are now part of my piece. You  like the people that are trapped in my work    Blender noises  laughter    have become part of my work as well.  Laughter  But  but this seems a bit unfair  right  I put my friends in jars  I put this character  this sort of endangered species character in a blender. But I'd never done anything about myself. I'd never really memorialized myself. So I decided to create a piece which is a self portrait piece. This is sort of a self portrait taxidermy time capsule piece called A Point Just Passed  in which I project myself on top of a time card punch clock  and it's up to you. If you want to choose to punch that punch card clock  you actually age me. So I start as a baby  and then if you punch the clock  you'll actually transform the baby into a toddler  and then from a toddler I'm transformed into a teenager. From a teenager  I'm transformed into my current self. From my current self  I'm turned into a middle aged man  and then  from there  into an elderly man. And if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times in one day  the piece goes black and is not to be reset until the next day. So  in doing so  you're erasing time. You're actually implicit in this work and you're erasing my life. So I like this about interactive video sculpture  that you can actually interact with it  that all of you can actually touch an artwork and be part of the artwork yourselves  and hopefully  one day  I'll have each and every one of you trapped in one of my jars.  Laughter  Thank you.  Applause  Now  I don't usually like cartoons  I don't think many of them are funny  I find them weird. But I love this cartoon from the New Yorker. So  the guy is telling the cat  don't you dare think outside the box. Well  I'm afraid I used to be the cat. I always wanted to be outside the box. And it's partly because I came to this field from a different background  chemist and a bacterial geneticist. So  what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer  sources of cancer  or  for that matter  why you are who you are  didn't make sense. So  let me quickly try and tell you why I thought that and how I went about it. So  to begin with  however  I have to give you a very  very quick lesson in developmental biology  with apologies to those of you who know some biology. So  when your mom and dad met  there is a fertilized egg  that round thing with that little blip. It grows and then it grows  and then it makes this handsome man. So  this guy  with all the cells in his body  all have the same genetic information. So how did his nose become his nose  his elbow his elbow  and why doesn't he get up one morning and have his nose turn into his foot  It could. It has the genetic information. You all remember  dolly  it came from a single mammary cell. So  why doesn't it do it  So  have a guess of how many cells he has in his body. Somewhere between    trillion to    trillion cells in his body. Trillion  Now  how did these cells  all with the same genetic material  make all those tissues  And so  the question I raised before becomes even more interesting if you thought about the enormity of this in every one of your bodies. Now  the dominant cancer theory would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cancer cell  and it would make you a cancer victim. Well  this did not make sense to me. Do you even know how a trillion looks  Now  let's look at it. There it comes  these zeroes after zeroes after zeroes. Now  if .     of these cells got mutated  and .      got cancer  you will be a lump of cancer. You will have cancer all over you. And you're not. Why not  So  I decided over the years  because of a series of experiments that this is because of context and architecture. And let me quickly tell you some crucial experiment that was able to actually show this. To begin with  I came to work with this virus that causes that ugly tumor in the chicken. Rous discovered this in     . It was the first cancer virus discovered  and when I call it  oncogene   meaning  cancer gene.  So  he made a filtrate  he took this filter which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter  and he injected it to another chicken  and he got another tumor. So  scientists were very excited  and they said  a single oncogene can do it. All you need is a single oncogene. So  they put the cells in cultures  chicken cells  dumped the virus on it  and it would pile up  and they would say  this is malignant and this is normal. And again this didn't make sense to me. So for various reasons  we took this oncogene  attached it to a blue marker  and we injected it into the embryos. Now look at that. There is that beautiful feather in the embryo. Every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene inside a cancer cell  and they're part of the feather. So  when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish  we got a mass of blue cells. So  in the chicken you get a tumor  in the embryo you don't  you dissociate  you put it in a dish  you get another tumor. What does that mean  That means that microenvironment and the context which surrounds those cells actually are telling the cancer gene and the cancer cell what to do. Now  let's take a normal example. The normal example  let's take the human mammary gland. I work on breast cancer. So  here is a lovely human breast. And many of you know how it looks  except that inside that breast  there are all these pretty  developing  tree like structures. So  we decided that what we like to do is take just a bit of that mammary gland  which is called an  acinus   where there are all these little things inside the breast where the milk goes  and the end of the nipple comes through that little tube when the baby sucks. And we said  wonderful  Look at this pretty structure. We want to make this a structure  and ask the question  how do the cells do that  So  we took the red cells    you see the red cells are surrounded by blue  other cells that squeeze them  and behind it is material that people thought was mainly inert  and it was just having a structure to keep the shape  and so we first photographed it with the electron microscope years and years ago  and you see this cell is actually quite pretty. It has a bottom  it has a top  it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk  because it just came from an early pregnant mouse. You take these cells  you put them in a dish  and within three days  they look like that. They completely forget. So you take them out  you put them in a dish  they don't make milk. They completely forget. For example  here is a lovely yellow droplet of milk on the left  there is nothing on the right. Look at the nuclei. The nuclei in the cell on the left is in the animal  the one on the right is in a dish. They are completely different from each other. So  what does this tell you  This tells you that here also  context overrides. In different contexts  cells do different things. But how does context signal  So  Einstein said that  For an idea that does not first seem insane  there is no hope.  So  you can imagine the amount of skepticism I received    couldn't get money  couldn't do a whole lot of other things  but I'm so glad it all worked out. So  we made a section of the mammary gland of the mouse  and all those lovely acini are there  every one of those with the red around them are an acinus  and we said okay  we are going to try and make this  and I said  maybe that red stuff around the acinus that people think there's just a structural scaffold  maybe it has information  maybe it tells the cells what to do  maybe it tells the nucleus what to do. So I said  extracellular matrix  which is this stuff called ECM  signals and actually tells the cells what to do. So  we decided to make things that would look like that. We found some gooey material that had the right extracellular matrix in it  we put the cells in it  and lo and behold  in about four days  they got reorganized and on the right  is what we can make in culture. On the left is what's inside the animal  we call it in vivo  and the one in culture was full of milk  the lovely red there is full of milk. So  we Got Milk  for the American audience. All right. And here is this beautiful human cell  and you can imagine that here also  context goes. So  what do we do now  I made a radical hypothesis. I said  if it's true that architecture is dominant  architecture restored to a cancer cell should make the cancer cell think it's normal. Could this be done  So  we tried it. In order to do that  however  we needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant  and on the left is the single normal cell  human breast  put in three dimensional gooey gel that has extracellular matrix  it makes all these beautiful structures. On the right  you see it looks very ugly  the cells continue to grow  the normal ones stop. And you see here in higher magnification the normal acinus and the ugly tumor. So we said  what is on the surface of these ugly tumors  Could we calm them down    they were signaling like crazy and they have pathways all messed up    and make them to the level of the normal  Well  it was wonderful. Boggles my mind. This is what we got. We can revert the malignant phenotype. And in order to show you that the malignant phenotype I didn't just choose one  here are little movies  sort of fuzzy  but you see that on the left are the malignant cells  all of them are malignant  we add one single inhibitor in the beginning  and look what happens  they all look like that. We inject them into the mouse  the ones on the right  and none of them would make tumors. We inject the other ones in the mouse      percent tumors. So  it's a new way of thinking about cancer  it's a hopeful way of thinking about cancer. We should be able to be dealing with these things at this level  and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior is regulated at the level of tissue organization and that the tissue organization is dependent on the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment. All right  thus form and function interact dynamically and reciprocally. And here is another five seconds of repose  is my mantra. Form and function. And of course  we now ask  where do we go now  We'd like to take this kind of thinking into the clinic. But before we do that  I'd like you to think that at any given time when you're sitting there  in your    trillion cells  the extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus  the nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix and this is how your balance is kept and restored. We have made a lot of discoveries  we have shown that extracellular matrix talks to chromatin. We have shown that there's little pieces of DNA on the specific genes of the mammary gland that actually respond to extracellular matrix. It has taken many years  but it has been very rewarding. And before I get to the next slide  I have to tell you that there are so many additional discoveries to be made. There is so much mystery we don't know. And I always say to the students and post docs I lecture to  don't be arrogant  because arrogance kills curiosity. Curiosity and passion. You need to always think  what else needs to be discovered  And maybe my discovery needs to be added to or maybe it needs to be changed. So  we have now made an amazing discovery  a post doc in the lab who is a physicist asked me  what do the cells do when you put them in  What do they do in the beginning when they do  I said  I don't know  we couldn't look at them. We didn't have high images in the old days. So she  being an imager and a physicist  did this incredible thing. This is a single human breast cell in three dimensions. Look at it. It's constantly doing this. Has a coherent movement. You put the cancer cells there  and they do go all over  they do this. They don't do this. And when we revert the cancer cell  it again does this. Absolutely boggles my mind. So the cell acts like an embryo. What an exciting thing. So I'd like to finish with a poem. Well I used to love English literature  and I debated in college  which one should I do  And unfortunately or fortunately  chemistry won. But here is a poem from Yeats. I'll just read you the last two lines. It's called  Among the School Children.   O body swayed to music   O brightening glance   How  can we know  the dancer from the dance   And here is Merce Cunningham  I was fortunate to dance with him when I was younger  and here he is a dancer  and while he is dancing  he is both the dancer and the dance. The minute he stops  we have neither. So it's like form and function. Now  I'd like to show you a current picture of my group. I have been fortunate to have had these magnificant students and post docs who have taught me so much  and I have had many of these groups come and go. They are the future and I try to make them not be afraid of being the cat and being told  don't think outside the box. And I'd like to leave you with this thought. On the left is water coming through the shore  taken from a NASA satellite. On the right  there is a coral. Now if you take the mammary gland and spread it and take the fat away  on a dish it looks like that. Do they look the same  Do they have the same patterns  Why is it that nature keeps doing that over and over again  And I'd like to submit to you that we have sequenced the human genome  we know everything about the sequence of the gene  the language of the gene  the alphabet of the gene  But we know nothing  but nothing  about the language and alphabet of form. So  it's a wonderful new horizon  it's a wonderful thing to discover for the young and the passionate old  and that's me. So go to it  So let me start by taking you back  back into the mists of your memory to perhaps the most anticipated year in your life  but certainly the most anticipated year in all human history  the year     . Remember that  Y K  the dotcom bubble  stressing about whose party you're going to go to as the clock strikes midnight  before the champagne goes flat  and then there's that inchoate yearning that was felt  I think  by many  that the millennium  that the year       should mean more  more than just a two and some zeroes. Well  amazingly  for once  our world leaders actually lived up to that millennium moment and back in      agreed to some pretty extraordinary stuff  visionary  measurable  long term targets called the Millennium Development Goals. Now  I'm sure you all keep a copy of the goals under your pillow  or by the bedside table  but just in case you don't  and your memory needs some jogging  the deal agreed then goes like this  developing countries promised to at least halve extreme poverty  hunger and deaths from disease  alongside some other targets  by       and developed nations promised to help them get that done by dropping debts  increasing smart aid  and trade reform. Well  we're approaching       so we'd better assess  how are we doing on these goals  But we've also got to decide  do we like such global goals  Some people don't. And if we like them  we've got to decide what we want to do on these goals going forward. What does the world want to do together  We've got to decide a process by which we decide. Well  I definitely think these goals are worth building on and seeing through  and here's just a few reasons why. Incredible partnerships between the private sector  political leaders  philanthropists and amazing grassroots activists across the developing world  but also         people marched in the streets of Edinburgh outside this very building for Make Poverty History. All together  they achieved these results  increased the number of people on anti retrovirals  life saving anti AIDS drugs  nearly halved deaths from malaria  vaccinated so many that  .  million lives will be saved. And combined  this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year  last year  than in the year     . That's       fewer kids dying every day  ten times you lot not dead every day  because of all of these partnerships. So I think this is amazing living proof of progress that more people should know about  but the challenge of communicating this kind of good news is probably the subject of a different TEDTalk. Anyway  for now  anyone involved in getting these results  thank you. I think this proved these goals are worth it. But there's still a lot of unfinished business. Still   .  million children die every year of preventable  treatable diseases  and     million kids are malnourished to the point of stunting  a horrible term which means physical and cognitive lifelong impairment. So there's plainly a lot more to do on the goals we've got. But then  a lot of people think there are things that should have been in the original package that weren't agreed back then that should now be included  like sustainable development targets  natural resource governance targets  access to opportunity  to knowledge  equity  fighting corruption. All of this is measurable and could be in the new goals. But the key thing here is  what do you think should be in the new goals  What do you want  Are you annoyed that I didn't talk about gender equality or education  Should those be in the new package of goals  And quite frankly  that's a good question  but there's going to be some tough tradeoffs and choices here  so you want to hope that the process by which the world decides these new goals is going to be legitimate  right  Well  as we gather here in Edinburgh  technocrats appointed by the U.N. and certain governments  with the best intentions  are busying themselves designing a new package of goals  and currently they're doing that through pretty much the same old late   th century  top down  elite  closed process. But  of course  since then  the Web and mobile telephony  along with ubiquitous reality TV formats have spread all around the world. So what we'd like to propose is that we use them to involve people from all around the world in an historic first  the world's first truly global poll and consultation  where everyone everywhere has an equal voice for the very first time. I mean  wouldn't it be a huge historic missed opportunity not to do this  given that we can  There's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake  tens of millions of lives  or deaths  at stake  and  I'd argue  the security and future of you and your family is also at stake. So  if you're with me  I'd say there's three essential steps in this crowdsourcing campaign  collecting  connecting and committing. So first of all  we've got to ground this campaign in core polling data. Let's go into every country that will let us in  ask       people what they want the new goals to be  making special efforts to reach the poorest  those without access to modern technology  and let's make sure that their views are at the center of the goals going forward. Then  we've got to commission a baseline survey to make sure we can monitor and progress the goals going forward. The original goals didn't really have good baseline survey data  and we're going to need the help of big data through all of this process to make sure we can really monitor the progress. And then we've got to connect with the big crowd. Now here  we see the role for an unprecedented coalition of social media giants and upstarts  telecoms companies  reality TV show formats  gaming companies  telecoms  all of them together in kind of their  We Are The World  moment. Could they come together and help the Millennium Development Goals get rebranded into the Millennial Generation's Goals  And if just five percent of the five billion plus who are currently connected made a comment  and that comment turned into a commitment  we could crowdsource a force of     million people around the world to help see these goals through. If we have this collected data  and this connected crowd  based upon our experience of campaigning and getting world leaders to commit  I think world leaders will commit to most of the crowdsourced recommendations. But the question really is  through this process will we all have become committed  And if we are  are we ready to iterate  monitor and provide feedback  make sure these promises are really delivering results  Well  there's some fantastic examples here to scale up  mostly piloted within Africa  actually. There's Open Data Kenya  which geocodes and crowdsources information about where projects are  are they delivering results. Often  they're not in the right place. And Ushahidi  which means  witness  in Swahili  which geocodes and crowdsources information in complex emergencies to help target responses. This is some of the most exciting stuff in development and democracy  where citizens on the edge of a network are helping to force open the process to make sure that the big global aid promises and vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people at a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid. This openness  this forcing openness  is key  and if it wasn't entirely transparent already  I should be open  I've got a completely transparent agenda. Long term trends suggest that this century is going to be a tough place to live  with population increases  consumption patterns increasing  and conflict over scarce natural resources. And look at the state of global politics today. Look at the Rio Earth Summit that happened just last week  or the Mexican G    also last week. Both  if we're honest  a bust. Our world leaders  our global politics  currently can't get it done. They need our help. They need the cavalry  and the cavalry's not going to come from Mars. It's got to come from us  and I see this process of deciding democratically in a bottom up fashion what the world wants to work on together as one vital means by which we can crowdsource the force to really build that constituency that's going to reinvigorate global governance in the   st century. I started in     . Let me finish in     . Many people made fun of a big campaign a few years ago we had called Make Poverty History. It was a naive thought in many people's minds  and it's true  it was just a t shirt slogan that worked for the moment. But look. The empirical condition of living under a dollar and    is trending down  and look where it gets to by     . It's getting near zero. Now sure  progress in China and India and poverty reduction there was key to that  but recently also in Africa  poverty rates are being reduced. It will get harder as we get towards zero  as the poor will be increasingly located in post conflict  fragile states  or maybe in middle income states where they don't really care about the marginalized. But I'm confident  with the right kind of political campaigning and creative and technological innovation combined working together more and more as one  I think we can get this and other goals done. Thank you.  Applause  Chris Anderson  Jamie  here's the puzzle to me. If there was an incident today where a hundred kids died in some tragedy or where  say  a hundred kids were kidnapped and then rescued by special forces  I mean  it would be all over the news for a week  right  You just put up  just as one of your numbers there  that          is that the number  Jamie Drummond  Fewer children every day. CA  Five thousand fewer children dying every day. I mean  it dwarfs  dwarfs everything that is actually on our news agenda  and it's invisible. This must drive you crazy. JD  It does  and we're having a huge debate in this country about aid levels  for example  and aid alone is not the whole solution. Nobody thinks it is. But  you know  if people saw the results of this smart aid  I mean  they'd be going crazy for it. I wish the         people who really did march outside this very building knew these results. Right now they don't  and it would be great to find a way to better communicate it  because we have not. Creatively  we've failed to communicate this success so far. If those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice and amplify it at the key moments  I know for a fact we'd get better policy. The Mexican G   need not have been a bust. Rio  if anyone cares about the environment  need not have been a bust  okay  But these conferences are going on  and I know people get skeptical and cynical about the big global summits and the promises and their never being kept  but actually  the bits that are  are making a difference  and what the politicians need is more permission from the public. CA  But you haven't fully worked out the Web mechanisms  etc. by which this might happen. I mean  if the people here who've had experience using open platforms  you're interested to talk with them this week and try to take this forward. JD  Absolutely. CA  All right  well I must say  if this conference led in some way to advancing that idea  that's a huge idea  and if you carry that forward  that is really awesome  so thank you. JD  I'd love your help. CA  Thank you  thank you. I'm going to start on a slightly somber note. Two thousand and seven  five years ago  my wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer. Stage IIB. Now  looking back  the most harrowing part of that experience was not just the hospital visits    these were very painful for my wife  understandably so. It was not even the initial shock of knowing that she had breast cancer at just    years old  absolutely no history of cancer in her family. The most horrifying and agonizing part of the whole experience was we were making decisions after decisions after decisions that were being thrust upon us. Should it be a mastectomy  Should it be a lumpectomy  Should it be a more aggressive form of treatment  given that it was stage IIB  With all the side effects  Or should it be a less aggressive form of treatment  And these were being thrust upon us by the doctors. Now you could ask this question  why were the doctors doing this  A simplistic answer would be  the doctors are doing this because they want to protect themselves legally. I think that is too simplistic. These are well meaning doctors  some of them have gone on to become very good friends. They probably were simply following the wisdom that has come down through the ages  this adage that when you're making decisions  especially decisions of importance  it's best to be in charge  it's best to be in control  it's best to be in the driver's seat. And we were certainly in the driver's seat  making all these decisions. And let me tell you    if some of you have been there  it was a most agonizing and harrowing experience. Which got me thinking. I said  is there any validity to this whole adage that when you're making decisions  it's best to take the driver's seat  be in charge  be in control  Or are there contexts where we're far better off taking the passenger's seat and have someone else drive  For example  a trusted financial advisor  could be a trusted doctor  etc. And since I study human decision making  I said  I'm going to run some studies to find some answers. And I'm going to share one of these studies with you today. So  imagine that all of you are participants in the study. I want to tell you that what you're going to do in the study is  you're going to drink a cup of tea. If you're wondering why  I'll tell you why in a few seconds from now. You are going to solve a series of puzzles  and I'm going to show you examples of these puzzles momentarily. And the more puzzles you solve  the greater the chances that you'll win some prizes. Now  why do you have to consume the tea  Why  Because it makes a lot of sense  In order to solve these puzzles effectively  if you think about it  your mind needs to be in two states simultaneously  right  It needs to be alert  for which caffeine is very good. Simultaneously  it needs to be calm    not agitated  calm    for which chamomile is very good. Now comes the between subjects design  the AB design  the AB testing. So what I'm going to do is randomly assign you to one of two groups. So imagine that there is an imaginary line out here  so everyone here will be group A  everyone out here will be group B. Now  for you folks  what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you these two teas  and I'll go ahead and ask you to choose your tea. So you can choose whichever tea you want. You can decide  what is your mental state  OK  I choose the caffeinated tea  I choose the chamomile tea. So you're going to be in charge  you're going to be in control  you're going to be in the driver's seat. You folks  I'm going to show you these two teas  but you don't have a choice. I'm going to give you one of these two teas  and keep in mind  I'm going to pick one of these two teas at random for you. And you know that. So if you think about it  this is an extreme case scenario  because in the real world  whenever you are taking passenger's seat  very often the driver is going to be someone you trust  an expert  etc. So this is an extreme case scenario. Now  you're all going to consume the tea. So imagine that you're taking the tea now  we'll wait for you to finish the tea. We'll give another five minutes for the ingredient to have its effects. Now you're going to have    minutes to solve    puzzles. Here's an example of the puzzle you're going to solve. Anyone in the audience want to take a stab  Audience member  Pulpit  Baba Shiv  Whoa  OK. That's cool. Yeah  so what we'd do if we had you who gave the answer as a participant  we would have calibrated the difficulty level of the puzzles to your expertise. Because we want these puzzles to be difficult. These are tricky puzzles  because your first instinct is to say  tulip.  And then you have to unstick yourself. Right  So these have been calibrated to your level of expertise  because we want this to be difficult  and I'll tell you why  momentarily. Now  here's another example. Anyone  This is much more difficult. Audience member  Embark. BS  Yeah. Wow  OK. So  yeah  so this is  again  difficult. You'll say  kamber   then you'll go   maker   and all that  and then you can unstick yourself. So you have    minutes now to solve these    puzzles. Now  the question we're asking here is  in terms of the outcome    and it comes in the number of puzzles solved    will you in the driver's seat end up solving more puzzles because you are in control  you could decide which tea you would choose  or would you be better off  in terms of the number of puzzles solved  And  systemically  what we will show  across a series of studies  is that you  the passengers  even though the tea was picked for you at random  will end up solving more puzzles than you  the drivers. We also observe another thing  and that is  you folks not only are solving fewer puzzles  you're also putting less juice into the task    less effort  you're less persistent  and so on. How do we know that  Well  we have two objective measures. One is  what is the time  on average  you're taking in attempting to solve these puzzles  You will spend less time compared to you. Second  you have    minutes to solve these  are you taking the entire    minutes or are you giving up before the    minutes elapse  You will be more likely to give up before the    minutes elapse  compared to you. So you're putting in less juice  and therefore  the outcome  fewer puzzles solved. That brings us now to  why does this happen  And under what situations    when    would we see this pattern of results where the passenger is going to show better  more favorable outcomes  compared to the driver  It all has to do with when you face what I call the INCA. It's an acronym that stands for the nature of the feedback you're getting after you made the decision. So if you think about it  in this particular puzzle task    it could happen in investing in the stock market  very volatile out there  it could be the medical situation    the feedback here is immediate. You know the feedback  whether you're solving the puzzles or not. Right  Second  it is negative. Remember  the deck was stacked against you  in terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles. And this can happen in the medical domain. For example  very early on in the treatment  things are negative  the feedback  before things become positive. Right  It can happen in the stock market. Volatile stock market  getting negative feedback  it is also immediate. And the feedback in all these cases is concrete  it's unambiguous  you know if you've solved the puzzles or not. Now  the added one  apart from this immediacy  negative  this concreteness    now you have a sense of agency. You were responsible for your decision. So what do you do  You focus on the foregone option. You say  you know what  I should have chosen the other tea. That casts your decision in doubt  reduces the confidence you have in the decision  the confidence you have in the performance  the performance in terms of solving the puzzles. And therefore less juice into the task  fewer puzzles solved and less favorable outcomes compared to you folks. And this can happen in the medical domain  if you think about it  right  A patient in the driver's seat  for example. Less juice  which means keeping herself or himself less physically fit  physically active to hasten the recovery process  which is what is often advocated. You probably wouldn't do that. And therefore  there are times when you're facing the INCA  when the feedback is going to be immediate  negative  concrete and you have the sense of agency  where you're far better off taking the passenger's seat and have someone else drive. Now  I started off on a somber note. I want to finish up on a more upbeat note. It has now been five years  slightly more than five years  and the good news  thank God  is that the cancer is still in remission. So it all ends well. But one thing I didn't mention was that very early on into her treatment  my wife and I decided that we would take the passenger's seat. And that made so much of a difference in terms of the peace of mind that came with that  we could focus on her recovery. We let the doctors make all the decisions and take the driver's seat. Thank you. So wouldn't it be amazing if our phones could see the world in the same way that we do  as we're walking around being able to point a phone at anything  and then have it actually recognize images and objects like the human brain  and then be able to pull in information from an almost infinite library of knowledge and experiences and ideas. Well  traditionally that was seen as science fiction  but now we've moved to a world where actually this has become possible. So the best way of explaining it is to just show it. What you can see over here is Tamara  who is holding my phone that's now plugged in. So let me start with this. What we have here is a painting of the great poet Rabbie Burns  and it's just a normal image  but if we now switch inputs over to the phone  running our technology  you can see effectively what Tamara's seeing on the screen  and when she points at this image  something magical happens. Voice  Now simmer blinks on flowery braes ... Matt Mills  Now  what's great about this is  there's no trickery here. There's nothing done to this image. And what's great about this is the technology's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does. Not only that  but as I move the object around  it's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly. Again  the thing that's incredible about this is this is how advanced these devices have become. All the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself. Now  this has applications everywhere  whether in things like art in museums  like you just saw  or in the world of  say  advertising  or print journalism. So a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it's printed. And here is this morning's newspaper  and we have some Wimbledon news  which is great. Now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin. Voice  ... To the grass  and it's very important that you adapt and you  you have to be flexible  you have to be willing to change direction at a split second  and she does all that. She's won this title. MM  And that linking of the digital content to something that's physical is what we call an aura  and I'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk. So  what's great about this is it isn't just a faster  more convenient way to get information in the real world  but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible. So what I have here is a wireless router. My American colleagues have told me I've got to call it a router  so that everyone here understands    Laughter    but nonetheless  here is the device. So now what I can do is  rather than getting the instructions for the device online  I can simply point at it  the device is recognized  and then    Voice  Begin by plugging in the grey ADSL cable. Then connect the power. Finally  the yellow ethernet cable. Congratulations. You have now completed setup. The incredible work that made that possible was done here in the U.K. by scientists at Cambridge  and they work in our offices  and I've got a lovely picture of them here. They couldn't all be on stage  but we're going to bring their aura to the stage  so here they are. They're not very animated.  Laughter  This was the fourth take  I'm told.  Laughter  Okay. So  as we're talking about Cambridge  let's now move on to technical advancements  because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than    months ago  the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate  and that means that I can now take cinema quality  D models and place them in the world around me  so I have one over here. Tamara  would you like to jump in  MM  I should leap in. So then  after the fun  comes the more emotional side of what we do  because effectively  this technology allows you to see the world through someone's eyes  and for that person to be able to take a moment in time and effectively store it and tag it to something physical that exists in the real world. What's great about this is  the tools to do this are free. They're open  they're available to everyone within our application  and educators have really got on board with the classrooms. So we have teachers who've tagged up textbooks  teachers who've tagged up school classrooms  and a great example of this is a school in the U.K. I have a picture here from a video  and we're now going to play it. Teacher  See what happens.  Children talking  Keep going. Child  TV.  Children react  Child  Oh my God. Teacher  Now move it either side. See what happens. Move away from it and come back to it. Child  Oh  that is so cool. Teacher  And then  have you got it again  Child  Oh my God  How did you do that  Second child  It's magic. It's available for everyone to do  and actually I'm going to show you how easy it is to do by doing one right now. So  as sort of   I'm told it's called a stadium wave  so we're going to start from this side of the room on the count of three  and go over to here. Tamara  are you recording  Okay  so are you all ready  One  two  three. Go  Audience  Whooooooo  MM  Fellows are really good at that.  Laughs   Laughter  Okay. Now we're going to switch back into the Aurasma application  and what Tamara's going to do is tag that video that we just took onto my badge  so that I can remember it forever. Now  we have lots of people who are doing this already  and we've talked a little bit about the educational side. On the emotional side  we have people who've done things like send postcards and Christmas cards back to their family with little messages on them. We have people who have  for example  taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car and tagged up different components within an engine  so that if you're stuck and you want to find out more  you can point and discover the information. We're all very  very familiar with the Internet. In the last    years  it's really changed the way that we live and work  and the way that we see the world  and what's great is  we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift  because now we can literally take the content that we share  we discover  and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us. It's completely free to download this application. If you have a good Wi Fi connection or  G  this process is very  very quick. Oh  there we are. We can save it now. It's just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital fingerprint  and the great thing is  if you're a professional user     so  a newspaper    the tools are pretty much identical to what we've just used to create this demonstration. The only difference is that you've got the ability to add in links and slightly more content. Are you now ready  Tamara Roukaerts  We're ready to go. MM  Okay. So  I'm told we're ready  which means we can now point at the image  and there you all are. MM on video  One  two  three. Go  MM  Well done. We've been Aurasma. Thank you. Well  I was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia  which is total color blindness  so I've never seen color  and I don't know what color looks like  because I come from a grayscale world. To me  the sky is always gray  flowers are always gray  and television is still in black and white. But  since the age of     instead of seeing color  I can hear color. In       I started a project with computer scientist Adam Montandon  and the result  with further collaborations with Peter Kese from Slovenia and Matias Lizana from Barcelona  is this electronic eye. It's a color sensor that detects the color frequency in front of me    Frequency sounds    and sends this frequency to a chip installed at the back of my head  and I hear the color in front of me through the bone  through bone conduction. This is the sound of purple.  Frequency sounds  For example  this is the sound of grass.  Frequency sounds  This is red  like TED.  Frequency sounds  This is the sound of a dirty sock.  Laughter  Which is like yellow  this one. So I've been hearing color all the time for eight years  since       so I find it completely normal now to hear color all the time. At the start  though  I had to memorize the names you give for each color  so I had to memorize the notes  but after some time  all this information became a perception. I didn't have to think about the notes. And after some time  this perception became a feeling. I started to have favorite colors  and I started to dream in colors. So  when I started to dream in color is when I felt that the software and my brain had united  because in my dreams  it was my brain creating electronic sounds. It wasn't the software  so that's when I started to feel like a cyborg. It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device was no longer a device. It had become a part of my body  an extension of my senses  and after some time  it even became a part of my official image. This is my passport from     . You're not allowed to appear on U.K. passports with electronic equipment  but I insisted to the passport office that what they were seeing was actually a new part of my body  an extension of my brain  and they finally accepted me to appear with the passport photo. So  life has changed dramatically since I hear color  because color is almost everywhere  so the biggest change for example is going to an art gallery  I can listen to a Picasso  for example. So it's like I'm going to a concert hall  because I can listen to the paintings. And supermarkets  I find this is very shocking  it's very  very attractive to walk along a supermarket. It's like going to a nightclub. It's full of different melodies.  Laughter  Yeah. Especially the aisle with cleaning products. It's just fabulous.  Laughter  Also  the way I dress has changed. Before  I used to dress in a way that it looked good. Now I dress in a way that it sounds good.  Laughter  So today I'm dressed in C major  so it's quite a happy chord.  Laughter  If I had to go to a funeral  though  I would dress in B minor  which would be turquoise  purple and orange.  Laughter  Also  food  the way I look at food has changed  because now I can display the food on a plate  so I can eat my favorite song.  Laughter  So depending on how I display it  I can hear and I can compose music with food. So imagine a restaurant where we can have  like  Lady Gaga salads as starters.  Laughter  I mean  this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables  probably. And also  some Rachmaninov piano concertos as main dishes  and some Bjork or Madonna desserts  that would be a very exciting restaurant where you can actually eat songs. Also  the way I perceive beauty has changed  because when I look at someone  I hear their face  so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible. the other way around. So I really enjoy creating  like  sound portraits of people. Instead of drawing someone's face  like drawing the shape  I point at them with the eye and I write down the different notes I hear  and then I create sound portraits. Here's some faces. Yeah  Nicole Kidman sounds good.  Laughter  Some people  I would never relate  but they sound similar. Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman. They have similar sound of eyes. So you relate people that you wouldn't relate  and you can actually also create concerts by looking at the audience faces. So I connect the eye  and then I play the audience's faces. The good thing about this is  if the concert doesn't sound good  it's their fault. It's not my fault  because    Laughter  And so another thing that happens is that I started having this secondary effect that normal sounds started to become color. I heard a telephone tone  and it felt green because it sounded just like the color green. The BBC beeps  they sound turquoise  and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience  so I started to paint music and paint people's voices  because people's voices have frequencies that I relate to color. And here's some music translated into color. For example  Mozart   Queen of the Night   looks like this. because there's many different frequencies. And this is a completely different song. It is very pink and very yellow. So  also voices  I can transform speeches into color  for example  these are two very well known speeches. One of them is Martin Luther King's  I Have A Dream   and the other one is Hitler. And I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls without labels  and then I ask people   Which one do you prefer   And most people change their preference when I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler and the one on the right is Martin Luther King. So I got to a point when I was able to perceive     colors  just like human vision. I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel. But then  I just thought that this human vision wasn't good enough. There's many  many more colors around us that we cannot perceive  but that electronic eyes can perceive. So I decided to continue extending my color senses  and I added infrared and I added ultraviolet to the color to sound scale  so now I can hear colors that the human eye cannot perceive. For example  perceiving infrared is good because you can actually detect if there's movement detectors in a room. I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control. And the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that you can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe  because ultraviolet is a dangerous color  a color that can actually kill us  so I think we should all have this wish to perceive things that we cannot perceive. That's why  two years ago  I created the Cyborg Foundation  which is a foundation that tries to help people become a cyborg  tries to encourage people to extend their senses by using technology as part of the body. We should all think that knowledge comes from our senses  so if we extend our senses  we will consequently extend our knowledge. I think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body. I think this will be a big  big change that we will see during this century. So I do encourage you all to think about which senses you'd like to extend. I would encourage you to become a cyborg. You won't be alone. Thank you.  Applause  So the machine I'm going to talk you about is what I call the greatest machine that never was. It was a machine that was never built  and yet  it will be built. It was a machine that was designed long before anyone thought about computers. If you know anything about the history of computers  you will know that in the '  s and the '  s  simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today  and you would be correct  except for you'd have the wrong century. The first computer was really designed in the     s and     s  not the     s and     s. It was designed  and parts of it were prototyped  and the bits of it that were built are here in South Kensington. That machine was built by this guy  Charles Babbage. Now  I have a great affinity for Charles Babbage because his hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture.  Laughter  He was a very wealthy man  and a sort of  part of the aristocracy of Britain  and on a Saturday night in Marylebone  were you part of the intelligentsia of that period  you would have been invited round to his house for a soiree   and he invited everybody  kings  the Duke of Wellington  many  many famous people   and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines. I really miss that era  you know  where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you.  Laughter  But Babbage  Babbage himself was born at the end of the   th century  and was a fairly famous mathematician. He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge  and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking. He's less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of them. The reason he never made any of them  he's a classic nerd. Every time he had a good idea  he'd think   That's brilliant  I'm going to start building that one. I'll spend a fortune on it. I've got a better idea. I'm going to work on this one.  Laughter  And I'm going to do this one.  He did this until Sir Robert Peel  then Prime Minister  basically kicked him out of Number    Downing Street  and kicking him out  in those days  that meant saying   I bid you good day  sir.   Laughter  The thing he designed was this monstrosity here  the analytical engine. Now  just to give you an idea of this  this is a view from above. Every one of these circles is a cog  a stack of cogs  and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive. So as I go through this talk  I want you to imagine this gigantic machine. We heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have sounded like. And I'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine   that's why it's computer architecture   and tell you about this machine  which is a computer. So let's talk about the memory. The memory is very like the memory of a computer today  except it was all made out of metal  stacks and stacks of cogs     cogs high. Imagine a thing this high of cogs  hundreds and hundreds of them  and they've got numbers on them. It's a decimal machine. Everything's done in decimal. And he thought about using binary. The problem with using binary is that the machine would have been so tall  it would have been ridiculous. As it is  it's enormous. So he's got memory. The memory is this bit over here. You see it all like this. This monstrosity over here is the CPU  the chip  if you like. Of course  it's this big. Completely mechanical. This whole machine is mechanical. This is a picture of a prototype for part of the CPU which is in the Science Museum. The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic    so addition  multiplication  subtraction  division    which already is a bit of a feat in metal  but it could also do something that a computer does and a calculator doesn't  this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision. It could do the  if then  for basic programmers  and that fundamentally made it into a computer. It could compute. It couldn't just calculate. It could do more. Now  if we look at this  and we stop for a minute  and we think about chips today  we can't look inside a silicon chip. It's just so tiny. Yet if you did  you would see something very  very similar to this. There's this incredible complexity in the CPU  and this incredible regularity in the memory. If you've ever seen an electron microscope picture  you'll see this. This all looks the same  then there's this bit over here which is incredibly complicated. All this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does  but of course you need to program this thing  and of course  Babbage used the technology of the day and the technology that would reappear in the '  s  '  s and '  s  which is punch cards. This thing over here is one of three punch card readers in here  and this is a program in the Science Museum  just not far from here  created by Charles Babbage  that is sitting there   you can go see it   waiting for the machine to be built. And there's not just one of these  there's many of them. He prepared programs anticipating this would happen. Now  the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard  in France  had created the Jacquard loom  which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards  so he was just repurposing the technology of the day  and like everything else he did  he's using the technology of his era  so     s      s      s  cogs  steam  mechanical devices. Ironically  born the same year as Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday  who would completely revolutionize everything with the dynamo  transformers  all these sorts of things. Babbage  of course  wanted to use proven technology  so steam and things. Now  he needed accessories. Obviously  you've got a computer now. You've got punch cards  a CPU and memory. You need accessories you're going to come with. You're not just going to have that  So  first of all  you had sound. You had a bell  so if anything went wrong    Laughter    or the machine needed the attendant to come to it  there was a bell it could ring.  Laughter  And there's actually an instruction on the punch card which says  Ring the bell.  So you can imagine this  Ting   You know  just stop for a moment  imagine all those noises  this thing   Click  clack click click click   steam engine   Ding   right   Laughter  You also need a printer  obviously  and everyone needs a printer. This is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for another machine of his  called the Difference Engine No.    which he never built  but which the Science Museum did build in the '  s and '  s. It's completely mechanical  again  a printer. It prints just numbers  because he was obsessed with numbers  but it does print onto paper  and it even does word wrapping  so if you get to the end of the line  it goes around like that. You also need graphics  right  I mean  if you're going to do anything with graphics  so he said   Well  I need a plotter. I've got a big piece of paper and an ink pen and I'll make it plot.  So he designed a plotter as well  and  you know  at that point  I think he got pretty much a pretty good machine. Along comes this woman  Ada Lovelace. Now  imagine these soirees  all these great and good comes along. This lady is the daughter of the mad  bad and dangerous to know Lord Byron  and her mother  being a bit worried that she might have inherited some of Lord Byron's madness and badness  thought   I know the solution  Mathematics is the solution. We'll teach her mathematics. That'll calm her down.  there's never been a mathematician that's gone crazy  so  you know  that'll be fine.  Laughter  Everything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training  and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother  and Charles Babbage  you know  gets out his machine. The Duke of Wellington is there  you know  get out the machine  obviously demonstrates it  and she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime  really  who said   I understand what this does  and I understand the future of this machine.  And we owe to her an enormous amount because we know a lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to build because of her. Now  some people call her the first programmer. This is actually from one of    the paper that she translated. This is a program written in a particular style. It's not  historically  totally accurate that she's the first programmer  and actually  she did something more amazing. Rather than just being a programmer  she saw something that Babbage didn't. Babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics. He was building a machine to do mathematics  and Lovelace said   You could do more than mathematics on this machine.  And just as you do  everyone in this room already's got a computer on them right now  because they've got a phone. If you go into that phone  every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom. Whether it's video or text or music or voice  it's all numbers  it's all  underlying it  mathematical functions happening  and Lovelace said   Just because you're doing mathematical functions and symbols doesn't mean these things can't represent other things in the real world  such as music.  This was a huge leap  because Babbage is there saying   We could compute these amazing functions and print out tables of numbers and draw graphs      Laughter    and Lovelace is there and she says   Look  this thing could even compose music if you told it a representation of music numerically.  So this is what I call Lovelace's Leap. When you say she's a programmer  she did do some  but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be much  much more than this. Now  a hundred years later  this guy comes along  Alan Turing  and in       and invents the computer all over again. Now  of course  Babbage's machine was entirely mechanical. Turing's machine was entirely theoretical. Both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective  but Turing told us something very important. He laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science  and said   It doesn't matter how you make a computer.  It doesn't matter if your computer's mechanical  like Babbage's was  or electronic  like computers are today  or perhaps in the future  cells  or  again  mechanical again  once we get into nanotechnology. We could go back to Babbage's machine and just make it tiny. All those things are computers. There is in a sense a computing essence. This is called the Church Turing thesis. And so suddenly  you get this link where you say this thing Babbage had built really was a computer. In fact  it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers  only really slowly.  Laughter  To give you an idea of how slowly  it had about  k of memory. It used punch cards  which were being fed in  and it ran about        times slower the first ZX  . It did have a RAM pack. You could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to. So there are plans. Over in Swindon  the Science Museum archives  there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages of notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine. One of those is a set of plans that we call Plan     and that is also the name of a charity that I started with Doron Swade  who was the curator of computing at the Science Museum  and also the person who drove the project to build a difference engine  and our plan is to build it. Here in South Kensington  we will build the analytical engine. The project has a number of parts to it. One was the scanning of Babbage's archive. That's been done. The second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build. The third part is a computer simulation of that machine  and the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum. When it's built  you'll finally be able to understand how a computer works  because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you  you've got to look at this humongous thing and say   Ah  I see the memory operating  I see the CPU operating  I hear it operating. I probably smell it operating.   Laughter  But in between that we're going to do a simulation. Babbage himself wrote  he said  as soon as the analytical engine exists  it will surely guide the future course of science. Of course  he never built it  because he was always fiddling with new plans  but when it did get built  of course  in the     s  everything changed. Now  I'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like in motion with a video which shows just one part of the CPU mechanism working. So this is just three sets of cogs  and it's going to add. This is the adding mechanism in action  so you imagine this gigantic machine. So  give me five years. Before the     s happen  we'll have it. Thank you very much.  Applause  Frugal Digital is essentially a small research group at C.I.D. where we are looking to find alternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society. That's what we're after. And we do this because we actually believe that silicon technology today is mostly about a culture of excess. It's about the fastest and the most efficient and the most dazzling gadget you can have  while about two thirds of the world can hardly reach the most basic of this technology to even address fundamental needs in life  including health care  education and all these kinds of very fundamental issues. So before I start  I want to talk about a little anecdote  a little story about a man I met once in Mumbai. So this man  his name is Sathi Shri. He is an outstanding person  because he's a small entrepreneur. He runs a little shop in one of the back streets of Mumbai. He has this little    square meter store  where so much is being done. It's incredible  because I couldn't believe my eyes when I once just happened to bump into him. Basically  what he does is  he has all these services for micro payments and booking tickets and all kinds of basic things that you would go online for  but he does it for people offline and connects to the digital world. More importantly  he makes his money by selling these mobile recharge coupons  you know  for the prepaid subscriptions. But then  in the backside  he's got this little nook with a few of his employees where they can fix almost anything. Any cell phone  any gadget you can bring them  they can fix it. And it's pretty incredible because I took my iPhone there  and he was like   Yeah  do you want an upgrade    Yes.   Laughter  I was a bit skeptical  but then  I decided to give him a Nokia instead.  Laughter  But what I was amazed about is this reverse engineering and know how that's built into this little two meters of space. They have figured out everything that's required to dismantle  take things apart  rewrite the circuitry  re flash the firmware  do whatever you want to with the phone  and they can fix anything so quickly. You can hand over a phone this morning and you can go pick it up after lunch  and it was quite incredible. But then we were wondering whether this is a local phenomenon  or is truly global  And  over time  we started understanding and systematically researching what this tinkering ecosystem is about  because that is something that's happening not just in one street corner in Mumbai. It's actually happening in all parts of the country. It's even happening in Africa  like  for example  in Cape Town we did extensive research on this. Even here in Doha I found this little nook where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed  and it's a lot of tiny little parts. It's not easy. You've got to try it on your own to believe it. But what fuels this  It's this entire ecosystem of low cost parts and supplies that are produced all over the world  literally  and then redistributed to basically service this industry  and you can even buy salvaged parts. Basically  you don't have to necessarily buy brand new things. You have condemned computers that are stripped apart  and you can buy salvaged components and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration. But what does this new  sort of  approach give us  That's the real question  because this is something that's been there  part of every society that's deprived of enough resources. But there's an interesting paradigm. There's the traditional crafts  and then there's the technology crafts. We call it the technology crafts because these are emerging. They're not something that's been established. It's not something that's institutionalized. It's not taught in universities. It's taught  by  word of mouth  and it's an informal education system around this. So we said   What can we get out of this  You know  like  what are the key values that we can get out of this   The main thing is a fix it locally culture  which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn't have to go through a huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed. It also affords us cheap fabrication  which is fantastic  so it means that you can do a lot more with it. And then  the most important thing is  it gives us large math for low cost. So it means that you can actually embed pretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds of extendable ideas into really simple devices. So  what we call this is a silicon cottage industry. It's basically what was the system or the paradigm before the industrial revolution is now re happening in a whole new way in small digital shops across the planet in most developing countries. So  we kind of toyed around with this idea  and we said   What can we do with this  Can we make a little product or a service out of it   So one of the first things we did is this thing called a multimedia platform. We call it a lunch box. Basically one of the contexts that we studied was schools in very remote parts of India. So there is this amazing concept called the one teacher school  which is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker who teaches this amazing little social setting. It's an informal school  but it's really about holistic education. The only thing that they don't have is access to resources. They don't even have a textbook sometimes  and they don't even have a proper curriculum. So we said   What can we do to empower this teacher to do more   How to access the digital world  Instead of being the sole guardian of information  be a facilitator to all this information. So we said   What are the steps required to empower the teacher   How do you make this teacher into a digital gateway  and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform that can be constructed locally and serviced locally   So we walked around. We went and scavenged the nearby markets  and we tried to understand   What can we pick up that will make this happen   So the thing that we got was a little mobile phone with a little pico projector that comes for about    dollars. We went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery  and a bunch of small speakers. So essentially  the mobile phone gives us a connected multimedia platform. It allows us to get online and allows us to load up files of different formats and play them. The flashlight gives us this really intense  bright L.E.D.  and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack  and the lunch box is a nice little package in which you can put everything inside  and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of amplify the sound large enough. Believe me  those little classrooms are really noisy. They are kids who scream at the top of their voices  and you really have to get above that. And we took it back to this little tinkering setup of a mobile phone repair shop  and then the magic happens. We dismantle the whole thing  we reassemble it in a new configuration  and we do this hardware mashup  systematically training the guy how to do this. Out comes this  a little lunch box    form factor. And we systematically field tested  because in the field testing we learned some important lessons  and we went through many iterations. One of the key issues was battery consumption and charging. Luminosity was an issue  when you have too much bright sunlight outside. Often the roofs are broken  so you don't have enough darkness in the classroom to do these things. We extended this idea. We tested it many times over  and the next version we came up with was a box that kind of could trickle charge on solar energy  but most importantly connect to a car battery  because a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power in places where there's not enough electricity or erratic electricity. And the other key thing that we did was make this box run off a USB key  because we realized that even though there was GPRS and all that on paper  at least  in theory  it was much more efficient to send the data on a little USB key by surface mail. It might take a few days to get there  but at least it gets there in high definition and in a reliable quality. So we made this box  and we tested it again and again and again  and we're going through multiple iterations to do these things. But it's not limited to just education. This kind of a technique or metrology can actually be applied to other kinds of areas  and I'm going to tell you one more little story. It's about this little device called a medi meter. It's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed. In India  there is a context of these amazing people  the health care workers called ASHA workers. They are essentially foot soldiers for the health care system who live in the local community and are trained with basic tools and basic concepts of health care  and the main purpose is basically to inform people to basically  how to lead a better life  but also to divert or sort of make recommendations of what kind of health care should they approach  They are basically referral services  essentially. But the problem with that is that we realized after a bunch of research that they are amazing at referring people to the nearest clinic or the public health care system  but what happens at the public health care system is this  these incredibly long lines and too many people who overload the system simply because there's not enough doctors and facilities for the population that's being referred. So everything from a common cold to a serious case of malaria gets almost the same level of attention  and there's no priorities. So we said   Come on  there's got to be a better way of doing this for sure.  So we said   What can we do with the ASHA worker that'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter  but not just a filter  a really well thought through referral system that allows load balancing of the network  and directs patients to different sources of health care based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations   So the real key question was  how do we empower this woman  How do we empower her with simple tools that's not diagnostic but more screening in nature so she at least knows how to advise the patients better  And that'll make such a huge difference on the system  because the amount of waiting time and the amount of distances that people need to travel  often sometimes seven to    kilometers  sometimes by foot  to get a simple health check done  is very  very detrimental in the sense that it really dissuades people from getting access to health care. So if there was something that she could do  that would be amazing. So what we did was that we converted this device into a medical device. I want to demo this actually  because it's a very simple process. Bruno  do you want to join us   Cheers  Come along.  Applause  So  what we're going to do is that we're going to measure a few basic parameters on you  including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen that's there in your blood. So you're going to put your thumb on top of this. Bruno Giussani  Like this  works  Vinay Venkatraman  Yeah. That's right. BG  Okay. VV  So I'm going to start it up. I hope it works. So ...  Laughter  So I take it into the start position  and then I press the read button.  Beeps  So it's taking a little reading from you.  Beeps  And then the pointer goes and points to three different options. Let's see what happens here. BG  Great. Good news.  Applause  VV  So ...  Applause  So the thing about this is that if the pointer  unfortunately  had pointed to the red spot  we would have to rush you to a hospital. Luckily  not today. And if it had pointed to the orange or the amber  it basically meant you had to have  sort of  more continuous care from the health care worker. So that was a very simple three step screening process that could basically change the equation of how public health care works in so many different ways. BG  Thank you for the good news. VV  Yeah. So  very briefly  I'll just explain to you how this is done  because that's the more interesting part. So essentially  the three things that are required to make this conversion from this guy to this guy is a cheap remote control for a television that you can almost find in every home today  some parts from a computer mouse  basically  something that you can scavenge for very low cost  and a few parts that have to be pre programmed. Basically this is a micro controller with a few extra components that can be shipped for very little cost across the world  and that's what is all required with a little bit of local tinkering talent to convert the device into something else. So we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basically ascertain whether something like this actually makes sense to the ASHA worker. We are going through some reference tests to compare it against professional equipment to see if there's a degree of change in efficacy and if it actually makes an impact in people's lives. But most importantly  what we are trying to do right now is we are trying to scale this up  because there are over         ASHA workers on the ground who are these amazing foot soldiers  and if we can give at least a fraction of them the access to these things  it just changes the way the economics of public health care works  and it changes the way systems actually function  not just on a systematic planning level  but also in a very grassroots  bottom up level. So that's it  and we hope to do this in a big way. Thank you.  Applause  I'm gonna talk a little bit about open source security  because we've got to get better at security in this   st century. Let me start by saying  let's look back to the   th century  and kind of get a sense of how that style of security worked for us. This is Verdun  a battlefield in France just north of the NATO headquarters in Belgium. At Verdun  in       over a     day period          people were killed  so about       a day. If you roll it forward      th century security    into the Second World War  you see the Battle of Stalingrad      days    million people killed. We go into the Cold War  and we continue to try and build walls. We go from the trench warfare of the First World War to the Maginot Line of the Second World War  and then we go into the Cold War  the Iron Curtain  the Berlin Wall. Walls don't work. My thesis for us today is  instead of building walls to create security  we need to build bridges. This is a famous bridge in Europe. It's in Bosnia Herzegovina. It's the bridge over the Drina River  the subject of a novel by Ivo Andri   and it talks about how  in that very troubled part of Europe and the Balkans  over time there's been enormous building of walls. More recently  in the last decade  we begin to see these communities start  hesitatingly  to come together. I would argue  again  open source security is about connecting the international  the interagency  the private public  and lashing it together with strategic communication  largely in social networks. So let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that  because our global commons is under attack in a variety of ways  and none of the sources of threat to the global commons will be solved by building walls. Now  I'm a sailor  obviously. This is a ship  a liner  clipping through the Indian Ocean. What's wrong with this picture  It's got concertina wire along the sides of it. That's to prevent pirates from attacking it. Piracy is a very active threat today around the world. This is in the Indian Ocean. Piracy is also very active in the Strait of Malacca. It's active in the Gulf of Guinea. We see it in the Caribbean. It's a     billion a year discontinuity in the global transport system. Last year  at this time  there were    vessels      mariners held hostage. This is an attack on the global commons. We need to think about how to address it. Let's shift to a different kind of sea  the cyber sea. Here are photographs of two young men. At the moment  they're incarcerated. They conducted a credit card fraud that netted them over    billion dollars. This is part of cybercrime which is a    trillion a year discontinuity in the global economy. Two trillion a year. That's just under the GDP of Great Britain. So this cyber sea  which we know endlessly is the fundamental piece of radical openness  is very much under threat as well. Another thing I worry about in the global commons is the threat posed by trafficking  by the movement of narcotics  opium  here coming out of Afghanistan through Europe over to the United States. We worry about cocaine coming from the Andean Ridge north. We worry about the movement of illegal weapons and trafficking. Above all  perhaps  we worry about human trafficking  and the awful cost of it. Trafficking moves largely at sea but in other parts of the global commons. This is a photograph  and I wish I could tell you that this is a very high tech piece of US Navy gear that we're using to stop the trafficking. The bad news is  this is a semi submersible run by drug cartels. It was built in the jungles of South America. We caught it with that low tech raft    Laughter    and it was carrying six tons of cocaine. Crew of four. Sophisticated communications sweep. This kind of trafficking  in narcotics  in humans  in weapons  God forbid  in weapons of mass destruction  is part of the threat to the global commons. And let's pull it together in Afghanistan today. This is a field of poppies in Afghanistan. Eighty to    percent of the world's poppy  opium and heroin  comes out of Afghanistan. We also see there  of course  terrorism. This is where al Qaeda is staged from. We also see a very strong insurgency embedded there. So this terrorism concern is also part of the global commons  and what we must address. So here we are    st century. We know our   th century tools are not going to work. What should we do  I would argue that we will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun. We will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun. We will need the application of military force. When we do it  we must do it well  and competently. But my thesis is  open source security is about international  interagency  private public connection pulled together by this idea of strategic communication on the Internet. Let me give you a couple of examples of how this works in a positive way. This is Afghanistan. These are Afghan soldiers. They are all holding books. You should say   That's odd. I thought I read that this demographic  young men and women in their   s and   s  is largely illiterate in Afghanistan.  You would be correct. Eighty five percent cannot read when they enter the security forces of Afghanistan. Why  Because the Taliban withheld education during the period of time in which these men and women would have learned to read. So the question is  so  why are they all standing there holding books  The answer is  we are teaching them to read in literacy courses by NATO in partnership with private sector entities  in partnership with development agencies. We've taught well over         Afghan Security Forces to read and write at a basic level. When you can read and write in Afghanistan  you will typically put a pen in your pocket. At the ceremonies  when these young men and women graduate  they take that pen with great pride  and put it in their pocket. This is bringing together international   there are    nations involved in this mission   interagency   these development agencies   and private public  to take on this kind of security. Now  we are also teaching them combat skills  of course  but I would argue  open source security means connecting in ways that create longer lasting security effect. Here's another example. This is a US Navy warship. It's called the Comfort. There's a sister ship called the Mercy. They are hospital ships. This one  the Comfort  operates throughout the Caribbean and the coast of South America conducting patient treatments. On a typical cruise  they'll do         patient treatments. It is crewed not strictly by military but by a combination of humanitarian organizations  Operation Hope  Project Smile. Other organizations send volunteers. Interagency physicians come out. They're all part of this. To give you one example of the impact this can have  this little boy  eight years old  walked with his mother two days to come to the eye clinic put on by the Comfort. When he was fitted  over his extremely myopic eyes  he suddenly looked up and said   Mama  veo el mundo.   Mom  I see the world.  Multiply this by         patient treatments  this private public collaboration with security forces  and you begin to see the power of creating security in a very different way. Here you see baseball players. Can you pick out the two US Army soldiers in this photograph  They are the two young men on either side of these young boys. This is part of a series of baseball clinics  where we have explored collaboration between Major League Baseball  the Department of State  who sets up the diplomatic piece of this  military baseball players  who are real soldiers with real skills but participate in this mission  and they put on clinics throughout Latin America and the Caribbean  in Honduras  in Nicaragua  in all of the Central American and Caribbean nations where baseball is so popular  and it creates security. It shows role models to young men and women about fitness and about life that I would argue help create security for us. Another aspect of this partnership is in disaster relief. This is a US Air Force helicopter participating after the tsunami in      which killed         people. In each of these major disasters   the tsunami in               dead  the Kashmiri earthquake in Pakistan               dead  the Haitian earthquake  about         dead  more recently the awful earthquake tsunami combination which struck Japan and its nuclear industry   in all of these instances  we see partnerships between international actors  interagency  private public working with security forces to respond to this kind of natural disaster. So these are examples of this idea of open source security. We tie it together  increasingly  by doing things like this. Now  you're looking at this thinking   Ah  Admiral  these must be sea lanes of communication  or these might be fiber optic cables.  No. This is a graphic of the world according to Twitter. Purple are tweets. Green are geolocation. White is the synthesis. It's a perfect evocation of that great population survey  the six largest nations in the world in descending order  China  India  Facebook  the United States  Twitter and Indonesia.  Laughter  Why do we want to get in these nets  Why do we want to be involved  We talked earlier about the Arab Spring  and the power of all this. I'll give you another example  and it's how you move this message. I gave a talk like this in London a while back about this point. I said  as I say to all of you  I'm on Facebook. Friend me. Got a little laugh from the audience. There was an article which was run by AP  on the wire. Got picked up in two places in the world  Finland and Indonesia. The headline was  NATO Admiral Needs Friends. Thank you.  Applause  Which I do.  Laughter  And the story was a catalyst  and the next morning I had hundreds of Facebook friend requests from Indonesians and Finns  mostly saying   Admiral  we heard you need a friend  and oh  by the way  what is NATO    Laughter  So ...  Laughter  Yeah  we laugh  but this is how we move the message  and moving that message is how we connect international  interagency  private public  and these social nets to help create security. Now  let me hit a somber note. This is a photograph of a brave British soldier. He's in the Scots Guards. He's standing the watch in Helmand  in southern Afghanistan. I put him here to remind us  I would not want anyone to leave the room thinking that we do not need capable  competent militaries who can create real military effect. That is the core of who we are and what we do  and we do it to protect freedom  freedom of speech  all the things we treasure in our societies. But  you know  life is not an on and off switch. You don't have to have a military that is either in hard combat or is in the barracks. I would argue life is a rheostat. You have to dial it in  and as I think about how we create security in this   st century  there will be times when we will apply hard power in true war and crisis  but there will be many instances  as we've talked about today  where our militaries can be part of creating   st century security  international  interagency  private public  connected with competent communication. I would close by saying that we heard earlier today about Wikipedia. I use Wikipedia all the time to look up facts  and as all of you appreciate  Wikipedia is not created by    brilliant people locked in a room writing articles. Wikipedia  every day  is tens of thousands of people inputting information  and every day millions of people withdrawing that information. It's a perfect image for the fundamental point that no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together. No one person  no one alliance  no one nation  no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together. The vision statement of Wikipedia is very simple  a world in which every human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. My thesis for you is that by combining international  interagency  private public  strategic communication  together  in this   st century  we can create the sum of all security. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Hi. This is my mobile phone. A mobile phone can change your life  and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom. With a mobile phone  you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria. With a mobile phone  you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt. And with a mobile phone  you can record a song  load it up to SoundCloud and become famous. All this is possible with your mobile phone. I'm a child of       and I live in the city of Berlin. Let's go back to that time  to this city. Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change. This is autumn       and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket. Who in the room has a mobile phone with you  Hold it up. Hold your phones up  hold your phones up  Hold it up. An Android  a Blackberry  wow. That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone. But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone  and how it changed my life. And I will talk about this. These are        lines of information. Raw data. And why are these informations there  Because in the summer of       the E.U. Commission tabled a directive. This directive  is  called Data Retention Directive. This directive says that each phone company in Europe  each Internet service company all over Europe  has to store a wide range of information about the users. Who calls whom  Who sends whom an email  Who sends whom a text message  And if you use your mobile phone  where you are. All this information is stored for at least six months  up to two years by your phone company or your Internet service provider. And all over Europe  people stood up and said   We don't want this.  They said  we don't want this data retention. We want self determination in the digital age  and we don't want that phone companies and Internet companies have to store all this information about us. They were lawyers  journalists  priests  they all said   We don't want this.  And here you can see  like    thousands of people went out on the streets of Berlin and said   Freedom  not fear.  And some even said  this would be Stasi  . . Stasi was the secret police in East Germany. And I also ask myself  does it really work  Can they really store all this information about us  Every time I use my mobile phone  So I asked my phone company  Deutsche Telekom  which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany  and I asked them  please  send me all the information you have stored about me. And I asked them once  and I asked them again  and I got no real answer. It was only blah blah answers. But then I said  I want to have this information  because this is my life you are protocoling. So I decided to start a lawsuit against them  because I wanted to have this information. But Deutsche Telekom said  no  we will not give you this information. So at the end  I had a settlement with them. I'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information I ask for. Because in the mean time  the German Constitutional Court ruled that the implementation of this E.U. directive into German law was unconstitutional. So I got this ugly brown envelope with a C.D. inside. And on the C.D.  this was on. Thirty five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information. At first I saw it  and I said  okay  it's a huge file. Okay. But then after a while I realized  this is my life. This is six months of my life  into this file. So I was a little bit skeptical  what should I do with it  Because you can see where I am  where I sleep at night  what I am doing. But then I said  I want to go out with this information. I want to make them public. Because I want to show the people what does data retention mean. So together with Zeit Online and Open Data City  I did this. This is a visualization of six months of my life. You can zoom in and zoom out  you can wind back and fast forward. You can see every step I take. And you can even see how I go from Frankfurt by train to Cologne  and how often I call in between. All this is possible with this information. That's a little bit scary. But it is not only about me. It's about all of us. First  it's only like  I call my wife and she calls me  and we talk to each other a couple of times. And then there are some friends calling me  and they call each other. And after a while you are calling you  and you are calling you  and you have this great communication network. But you can see how your people are communicating with each other  what times they call each other  when they go to bed. You can see all of this. You can see the hubs  like who are the leaders in the group. If you have access to this information  you can see what your society is doing. If you have access to this information  you can control your society. This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran. This is a blueprint how to survey your society  because you know who talks to whom  who sends whom an email  all this is possible if you have access to this information. And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe  up to two years. Like I said at the beginning  imagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin in autumn of      had a mobile phone in their pocket. And the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest  and if the Stasi would have known who are the leaders behind it  this may never have happened. The fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not  have been  there. And in the aftermath  also not the fall of the Iron Curtain. Because today  state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us  online and offline. They want to have the possibility to track our lives  and they want to store them for all time. But self determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction. But you have to fight for your self determination today. You have to fight for it every day. So  when you go home  tell your friends that privacy is a value of the   st century  and it's not outdated. When you go home  tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information  they don't have to do it. And if you don't believe me  ask your phone company what information they store about you. So  in the future  every time you use your mobile phone  let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for self determination in the digital age. Thank you. I'm going to tell you about an affliction I suffer from. And I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you suffer from it as well. When I'm walking around an art gallery  rooms and rooms full of paintings  after about    or    minutes  I realize I'm not thinking about the paintings. I'm not connecting to them. Instead  I'm thinking about that cup of coffee I desperately need to wake me up. I'm suffering from gallery fatigue. How many of you out there suffer from    yes. Ha ha  ha ha  Now  sometimes you might last longer than    minutes  or even shorter  but I think we all suffer from it. And do you have the accompanying guilt  For me  I look at the paintings on the wall and I think  somebody has decided to put them there  thinks they're good enough to be on that wall  but I don't always see it. In fact  most of the time I don't see it. And I leave feeling actually unhappy. I feel guilty and unhappy with myself  rather than thinking there's something wrong with the painting  I think there's something wrong with me. And that's not a good experience  to leave a gallery like that. The thing is  I think we should give ourselves a break. If you think about going into a restaurant  when you look at the menu  are you expected to order every single thing on the menu  No  You select. If you go into a department store to buy a shirt  are you going to try on every single shirt and want every single shirt  Of course not  you can be selective. It's expected. How come  then  it's not so expected to be selective when we go to an art gallery  Why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting  Well I'm trying to take a different approach. And there's two things I do  When I go into a gallery  first of all  I go quite fast  and I look at everything  and I pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other. I don't even know why they make me slow down  but something pulls me like a magnet and then I ignore all the others  and I just go to that painting. So it's the first thing I do is  I do my own curation. I choose a painting. It might just be one painting in   . And then the second thing I do is I stand in front of that painting  and I tell myself a story about it. Why a story  Well  I think that we are wired  our DNA tells us to tell stories. We tell stories all the time about everything  and I think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy  chaotic place  and sometimes stories  we're trying to make sense of the world a little bit  trying to bring some order to it. Why not apply that to our looking at paintings  So I now have this sort of restaurant menu visiting of art galleries. There are three paintings I'm going to show you now that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks and want to tell stories about them. The first one needs little introduction     Girl with a Pearl Earring  by Johannes Vermeer    th century Dutch painter. This is the most glorious painting. I first saw it when I was     and I immediately went out and got a poster of it  and in fact I still have that poster.    years later it's hanging in my house. It's accompanied me everywhere I've gone  I never tire of looking at her. What made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with was just the gorgeous colors he uses and the light falling on her face. But I think what's kept me still coming back year after year is another thing  and that is the look on her face  the conflicted look on her face. I can't tell if she's happy or sad  and I change my mind all the time. So that keeps me coming back. One day     years after I had this poster on my wall  I lay in bed and looked at her  and I suddenly thought  I wonder what the painter did to her to make her look like that. And it was the first time I'd ever thought that the expression on her face is actually reflecting how she feels about him. Always before I'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl. Now I began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship. And I thought  well  what is that relationship  So I went to find out. I did some research and discovered  we have no idea who she is. In fact  we don't know who any of the models in any of Vermeer's paintings are  and we know very little about Vermeer himself. Which made me go   Yippee   I can do whatever I want  I can come up with whatever story I want to. So here's how I came up with the story. First of all  I thought  I've got to get her into the house. How does Vermeer know her  Well  there've been suggestions that she is his    year old daughter. The daughter at the time was    when he painted the painting. And I thought  no  it's a very intimate look  but it's not a look a daughter gives her father. For one thing  in Dutch painting of the time  if a woman's mouth was open  it was indicating sexual availability. It would have been inappropriate for Vermeer to paint his daughter like that. So it's not his daughter  but it's somebody close to him  physically close to him. Well  who else would be in the house  A servant  a lovely servant. So  she's in the house. How do we get her into the studio  We don't know very much about Vermeer  but the little bits that we do know  one thing we know is that he married a Catholic woman  they lived with her mother in a house where he had his own room where he    his studio. He also had    children. It would have been a chaotic  noisy household. And if you've seen Vermeer's paintings before  you know that they're incredibly calm and quiet. How does a painter paint such calm  quiet paintings with    kids around  Well  he compartmentalizes his life. He gets to his studio  and he says   Nobody comes in here. Not the wife  not the kids. Okay  the maid can come in and clean.  She's in the studio. He's got her in the studio  they're together. And he decides to paint her. He has her wear very plain clothes. Now  all of the women  or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintings wore velvet  silk  fur  very sumptuous materials. This is very plain  the only thing that isn't plain is her pearl earring. Now  if she's a servant  there is no way she could afford a pair of pearl earrings. So those are not her pearl earrings. Whose are they  We happen to know  there's a list of Catharina  the wife's clothes. Amongst them a yellow coat with white fur  a yellow and black bodice  and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings  different women in the paintings  Vermeer's paintings. So clearly  her clothes were lent to various different women. It's not such a leap of faith to take that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife. So we've got all the elements for our story. She's in the studio with him for a long time. These paintings took a long time to make. They would have spent the time alone  all that time. She's wearing his wife's pearl earring. She's gorgeous. She obviously loves him. She's conflicted. And does the wife know  Maybe not. And if she doesn't  well    that's the story. The next painting I'm going to talk about is called  Boy Building a House of Cards  by Chardin. He's an   th century French painter best known for his still lifes  but he did occasionally paint people. And in fact  he painted four versions of this painting  different boys building houses of cards  all concentrated. I like this version the best  because some of the boys are older and some are younger  and to me  this one  like Goldilocks's porridge  is just right. He's not quite a child  and he's not quite a man. He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience  and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting. And I looked at his face. It's like a Vermeer painting a bit. The light comes in from the left  his face is bathed in this glowing light. It's right in the center of the painting  and you look at it  and I found that when I was looking at it  I was standing there going   Look at me. Please look at me.  And he didn't look at me. He was still looking at his cards  and that's one of the seductive elements of this painting is  he's so focused on what he's doing that he doesn't look at us. And that is  to me  the sign of a masterpiece  of a painting when there's a lack of resolution. He's never going to look at me. So I was thinking of a story where  if I'm in this position  who could be there looking at him  Not the painter  I don't want to think about the painter. I'm thinking of an older version of himself. He's a man  a servant  an older servant looking at this younger servant  saying   Look at me. I want to warn you about what you're about to go through. Please look at me.  And he never does. And that lack of resolution  the lack of resolution in  Girl with a Pearl Earring     we don't know if she's happy or sad. I've written an entire novel about her  and I still don't know if she's happy or sad. Again and again  back to the painting  looking for the answer  looking for the story to fill in that gap. And we may make a story  and it satisfies us momentarily  but not really  and we come back again and again. The last painting I'm going to talk about is called  Anonymous  by anonymous.  Laughter  This is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery. They thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury  and then they discovered that it wasn't him  and they have no idea who it is. Now  in the National Portrait Gallery  if you don't know the biography of the painting  it's kind of useless to you. They can't hang it on the wall  because they don't know who he is. So unfortunately  this orphan spends most of his time in storage  along with quite a number of other orphans  some of them some beautiful paintings. This painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons  One is the disconnection between his mouth that's smiling and his eyes that are wistful. He's not happy  and why isn't he happy  The second thing that really attracted me were his bright red cheeks. He is blushing. He's blushing for his portrait being made  This must be a guy who blushes all the time. What is he thinking about that's making him blush  The third thing that made me stop in my tracks is his absolutely gorgeous doublet. Silk  gray  those beautiful buttons. And you know what it makes me think of  is it's sort of snug and puffy  it's like a duvet spread over a bed. I kept thinking of beds and red cheeks  and of course I kept thinking of sex when I looked at him  and I thought  is that what he's thinking about  And I thought  if I'm going to make a story  what's the last thing I'm going to put in there  Well  what would a Tudor gentleman be preoccupied with  And I thought  well  Henry VIII  okay. He'd be preoccupied with his inheritance  with his heir. Who is going to inherit his name and his fortune  You put all those together  and you've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back. Now  here's the story. It's short.  Rosy  I am still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave me. It has a plain high collar  detachable sleeves and intricate buttons of twisted silk thread  set close together so that the fit is snug. The doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed. Perhaps that was the intention. I first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor. I knew even before I stood up to speak that my cheeks were inflamed. I have always flushed easily  from physical exertion  from wine  from high emotion. As a boy  I was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys  but not by George. Only George could call me Rosy. I would not allow anyone else. He managed to make the word tender. When I made the announcement  George did not turn rosy  but went pale as my doublet. He should not have been surprised. It has been a common assumption that I would one day marry his cousin. But it is difficult to hear the words aloud. I know  I could barely utter them. Afterwards  I found George on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden. Despite drinking steadily all afternoon  he was still pale. We stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces.  What do you think of my doublet   I asked. He glanced at me.  That collar looks to be strangling you.   We will still see each other   I insisted.  We can still hunt and play cards and attend court. Nothing need change.  George did not speak.  I am    years old. It is time for me to marry and produce an heir. It is expected of me.  George drained another glass of claret and turned to me.  Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials  James. I'm sure you'll be content together.  He never used my nickname again. Thank you. Thank you. Doc Edgerton inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple  and exposure just a millionth of a second. But now     years later  we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million or a billion  but one trillion frames per second. I present to you a new type of photography  femto photography  a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion. And with that  we can create cameras that can look around corners  beyond line of sight  or see inside our body without an x ray  and really challenge what we mean by a camera. Now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second    which is several femtoseconds    I'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide. And that packet of photons  that bullet  will travel at the speed of light  and again  a million times faster than an ordinary bullet. Now  if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire into this bottle  how will those photons shatter into this bottle  How does light look in slow motion   Light in Slow Motion ...    Billion x Slow  Now  the whole event    Now remember  the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond    that's how much time it takes for light to travel. But I'm slowing down in this video by a factor of    billion  so you can see the light in motion. But Coca Cola did not sponsor this research. Now  there's a lot going on in this movie  so let me break this down and show you what's going on. So the pulse enters the bottle  our bullet  with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside. Some of the light leaks  goes on the table  and you start seeing these ripples of waves. Many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions. As you can see  there's a bubble of air and it's bouncing around inside. Meanwhile  the ripples are traveling on the table  and because of the reflections at the top  you see at the back of the bottle  after several frames  the reflections are focused. Now  if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video    again  by a factor of    billion    do you know how long you'll have to sit here to watch that movie  A day  a week  Actually  a whole year. It'll be a very boring movie    of a slow  ordinary bullet in motion. And what about some still life photography  You can watch the ripples  again  washing over the table  the tomato and the wall in the back. It's like throwing a stone in a pond of water. I thought  this is how nature paints a photo  one femto frame at a time  but of course our eye sees an integral composite. But if you look at this tomato one more time  you will notice  as the light washes over the tomato  it continues to glow. It doesn't become dark. Why is that  Because the tomato is actually ripe  and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato  and it comes out after several trillionths of a second. So in the future  when this femto camera is in your camera phone  you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it. So how did my team at MIT create this camera  Now  as photographers  you know  if you take a short exposure photo  you get very little light. But we're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure  so you're going to get hardly any light. So what we do is we send that bullet    that packet of photons    millions of times  and record again and again with very clever synchronization  and from the gigabytes of data  we computationally weave together to create those femto videos I showed you. And we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways. So  Superman can fly. Some other heroes can become invisible. But what about a new power for a future superhero  To see around corners. The idea is that we could shine some light on the door  it's going to bounce  go inside the room  some of that is going to reflect back on the door  and then back to the camera. And we could exploit these multiple bounces of light. And it's not science fiction. We have actually built it. On the left  you see our femto camera. There's a mannequin hidden behind a wall  and we're going to bounce light off the door. So after our paper was published in Nature Communications  it was highlighted by Nature.com  and they created this animation.  A laser pulse is fired  Ramesh Raskar  We're going to fire those bullets of light  and they're going to hit this wall  and because of the packet of the photons  they will scatter in all the directions  and some of them will reach our hidden mannequin  which in turn will again scatter that light  and again in turn  the door will reflect some of that scattered light. And a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera  but most interestingly  they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot. And because we have a camera that can run so fast    our femto camera    it has some unique abilities. It has very good time resolution  and it can look at the world at the speed of light. And this way  we know the distances  of course to the door  but also to the hidden objects  but we don't know which point corresponds to which distance. By shining one laser  we can record one raw photo  which  if you look on the screen  doesn't really make any sense. But then we will take a lot of such pictures  dozens of such pictures  put them together  and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light  and from that  can we see the hidden object  Can we see it in full  D  So this is our reconstruction. Now  we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road  but in the future  we could create cars that avoid collisions with what's around the bend. Or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows. Or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders  and also for cardioscopes. But of course  because of tissue and blood  this is quite challenging  so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about femto photography as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems. Now  like Doc Edgerton  a scientist himself  science became art    an art of ultra fast photography. And I realized that all the gigabytes of data that we're collecting every time  are not just for scientific imaging. But we can also do a new form of computational photography  with time lapse and color coding. And we look at those ripples. Remember  The time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second. But there's also something funny going on here. When you look at the ripples under the cap  the ripples are moving away from us. The ripples should be moving towards us. What's going on here  It turns out  because we're recording nearly at the speed of light  we have strange effects  and Einstein would have loved to see this picture. The order at which events take place in the world appears in the camera sometimes in reversed order. So by applying the corresponding space and time warp  we can correct for this distortion. So whether it's for photography around corners  or creating the next generation of health imaging  or creating new visualizations  since our invention  we have open sourced all the data and details on our website  and our hope is that the DIY  the creative and the research communities will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels in cameras    and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging. It's about time. Thank you. As an architect  I often ask myself  what is the origin of the forms that we design  What kind of forms could we design if we wouldn't work with references anymore  If we had no bias  if we had no preconceptions  what kind of forms could we design if we could free ourselves from our experience  If we could free ourselves from our education  What would these unseen forms look like  Would they surprise us  Would they intrigue us  Would they delight us  If so  then how can we go about creating something that is truly new  I propose we look to nature. Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms. And I'm not saying that we should copy nature  I'm not saying we should mimic biology  instead I propose that we can borrow nature's processes. We can abstract them and to create something that is new. Nature's main process of creation  morphogenesis  is the splitting of one cell into two cells. And these cells can either be identical  or they can be distinct from each other through asymmetric cell division. If we abstract this process  and simplify it as much as possible  then we could start with a single sheet of paper  one surface  and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces. We're free to choose where we make the fold. And by doing so  we can differentiate the surfaces. Through this very simple process  we can create an astounding variety of forms. Now  we can take this form and use the same process to generate three dimensional structures  but rather than folding things by hand  we'll bring the structure into the computer  and code it as an algorithm. And in doing so  we can suddenly fold anything. We can fold a million times faster  we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations. And as we're seeking to make something three dimensional  we start not with a single surface  but with a volume. A simple volume  the cube. If we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again  then after    iterations     steps  we end up with         surfaces and a shape that looks  for instance  like this. And if we change where we make the folds  if we change the folding ratio  then this cube turns into this one. We can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape  or this shape. So we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we're making the fold  but essentially you're looking at a folded cube. And we can play with this. We can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions. We can begin to sculpt the form. And because we're doing the folding on the computer  we are completely free of any physical constraints. So that means that surfaces can intersect themselves  they can become impossibly small. We can make folds that we otherwise could not make. Surfaces can become porous. They can stretch. They can tear. And all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce. But in each case  I didn't design the form. I designed the process that generated the form. In general  if we make a small change to the folding ratio  which is what you're seeing here  then the form changes correspondingly. But that's only half of the story      .  percent of the folding ratios produce not this  but this  the geometric equivalent of noise. The forms that I showed before were made actually through very long trial and error. A far more effective way to create forms  I have found  is to use information that is already contained in forms. A very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye. So  for instance  we can plot the length of the edges. White surfaces have long edges  black ones have short ones. We can plot the planarity of the surfaces  their curvature  how radial they are    all information that may not be instantly visible to you  but that we can bring out  that we can articulate  and that we can use to control the folding. So now I'm not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it  but instead I'm establishing a rule  I'm establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded. And because I've designed the process and not the form  I can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms. These forms look elaborate  but the process is a very minimal one. There is a simple input  it's always a cube that I start with  and it's a very simple operation    it's making a fold  and doing this over and over again. So let's bring this process to architecture. How  And at what scale  I chose to design a column. Columns are architectural archetypes. They've been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty  about technology. A challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column. I started using four cylinders. Through a lot of experimentation  these cylinders eventually evolved into this. And these columns  they have information at very many scales. We can begin to zoom into them. The closer one gets  the more new features one discovers. Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility. And unlike traditional architecture  it's a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail. These forms are undrawable. An architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months  or it would take even a year to draw all the sections  all of the elevations  you can only create something like this through an algorithm. The more interesting question  perhaps  is  are these forms imaginable  Usually  an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he is designing. In this case  the process is deterministic. There's no randomness involved at all  but it's not entirely predictable. There's too many surfaces  there's too much detail  one can't see the end state. So this leads to a new role for the architect. One needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there. For one thing  one can design many variants of a form  in parallel  and one can cultivate them. And to go back to the analogy with nature  one can begin to think in terms of populations  one can talk about permutations  about generations  about crossing and breeding to come up with a design. And the architect is really  he moves into the position of being an orchestrator of all of these processes. But enough of the theory. At one point I simply wanted to jump inside this image  so to say  I bought these red and blue  D glasses  got up very close to the screen  but still that wasn't the same as being able to walk around and touch things. So there was only one possibility    to bring the column out of the computer. There's been a lot of talk now about  D printing. For me  or for my purpose at this moment  there's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale  on the one hand  and resolution and speed  on the other. So instead  we decided to take the column  and we decided to build it as a layered model  made out of very many slices  thinly stacked over each other. What you're looking at here is an X ray of the column that you just saw  viewed from the top. Unbeknownst to me at the time  because we had only seen the outside  the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves  to grow on the inside of the column  which was quite a surprising discovery. From this shape  we calculated a cutting line  and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter to produce    and you're seeing a segment of it here    very many thin slices  individually cut  on top of each other. And this is a photo now  it's not a rendering  and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work  ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer. Almost all of the details  almost all of the surface intricacies were preserved. But it was very labor intensive. There's a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical. It took me several months to design the column  but ultimately it takes the computer about    seconds to calculate all of the    million faces. The physical model  on the other hand  is       layers  one millimeter thick  it weighs     kilos  it's made of sheet that can cover this entire auditorium. And the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here to the airport and back again. But it is increasingly possible. Machines are getting faster  it's getting less expensive  and there's some promising technological developments just on the horizon. These are images from the Gwangju Biennale. And in this case  I used ABS plastic to produce the columns  we used the bigger  faster machine  and they have a steel core inside  so they're structural  they can bear loads for once. Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns. You can see a different column in the mirror  if there's a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion. So where does this leave us  I think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object  but a process to generate objects. I've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature  there's countless other ones. In short  we have no constraints. Instead  we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at all scales that we couldn't even have dreamt up. And  if I may add  at one point we will build them. Thank you.  Applause  This man is wearing what we call a bee beard.  Laughter  A beard full of bees. Now  this is what many of you might picture when you think about honeybees  maybe insects  or maybe anything that has more legs than two. And let me start by telling you  I gotcha. I understand that. But  there are many things to know  and I want you to open your minds here  keep them open  and change your perspective about honeybees. Notice that this man is not getting stung. He probably has a queen bee tied to his chin  and the other bees are attracted to it. So this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees  and that goes deep back for thousands of years. We're very co evolved  because we depend on bees for pollination and  even more recently  as an economic commodity. Many of you may have heard that honeybees are disappearing  not just dying  but they're gone. We don't even find dead bodies. This is called colony collapse disorder  and it's bizarre. Researchers around the globe still do not know what's causing it  but what we do know is that  with the declining numbers of bees  the costs of over     fruit and vegetable crops that we rely on for food is going up in price. So honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture. Here you can see some pictures of what are called green roofs  or urban agriculture. We're familiar with the image on the left that shows a local neighborhood garden in the South End. That's where I call home. I have a beehive in the backyard. And perhaps a green roof in the future  when we're further utilizing urban areas  where there are stacks of garden spaces. Check out this image above the orange line in Boston. Try to spot the beehive. It's there. It's on the rooftop  right on the corner there  and it's been there for a couple of years now. The way that urban beekeeping currently operates is that the beehives are quite hidden  and it's not because they need to be. It's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea  and that's why I want you today to try to think about this  think about the benefits of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing. Let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works. So we know flowers  we know fruits and vegetables  even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat  rely on pollinators  but you've got male and female parts to a plant here  and basically pollinators are attracted to plants for their nectar  and in the process  a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen  or that male kind of sperm counterpart  along the way  and then travel to different flowers  and eventually an apple  in this case  will be produced. You can see the orientation. The stem is down. The blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it  but that's a basic overview of how pollination works. And let's think about urban living  not today  and not in the past  but what about in a hundred years  What's it gonna look like  We have huge grand challenges these days of habitat loss. We have more and more people  billions of people  in     years  God knows how many people  and how little space there will be to fit all of them  so we need to change the way that we see cities  and looking at this picture on the left of New York City today  you can see how gray and brown it is. We have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back into the atmosphere  contributing to global climate change  no doubt. What about in     years  if we have green rooftops everywhere  and gardening  and we create our own crops right in the cities  We save on the costs of transportation  we save on a healthier diet  and we also educate and create new jobs locally. We need bees for the future of our cities and urban living. Here's some data that we collected through our company with Best Bees  where we deliver  install and manage honeybee hives for anybody who wants them  in the city  in the countryside  and we introduce honeybees  and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop or fire escape  for even that matter  and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is. There's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed in these numbers. So let's look at the first metric here  overwintering survival. Now this has been a huge problem for many years  basically since the late     s  when the varroa mite came and brought many different viruses  bacteria and fungal diseases with it. Overwintering success is hard  and that's when most of the colonies are lost  and we found that in the cities  bees are surviving better than they are in the country. A bit counterintuitive  right  We think  oh  bees  countryside  agriculture  but that's not what the bees are showing. The bees like it in the city.  Laughter  Furthermore  they also produce more honey. The urban honey is delicious. The bees in Boston on the rooftop of the Seaport Hotel  where we have hundreds of thousands of bees flying overheard right now that I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by  are going to all of the local community gardens and making delicious  healthy honey that just tastes like the flowers in our city. So the yield for urban hives  in terms of honey production  is higher as well as the overwintering survival  compared to rural areas. Again  a bit counterintuitive. And looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee health  we can go back to the year     and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland. So the problems of bees today isn't necessarily something new. It has been happening since over a thousand years ago  but what we don't really notice are these problems in cities. So one thing I want to encourage you to think about is the idea of what an urban island is. You think in the city maybe the temperature's warmer. Why are bees doing better in the city  This is a big question now to help us understand why they should be in the city. Perhaps there's more pollen in the city. With the trains coming in to urban hubs  they can carry pollen with them  very light pollen  and it's just a big supermarket in the city. A lot of linden trees live along the railroad tracks. Perhaps there are fewer pesticides in the cities than there are in  rural  areas. Perhaps there are other things that we're just not thinking about yet  but that's one idea to think about  urban islands. And colony collapse disorder is not the only thing affecting honeybees. Honeybees are dying  and it's a huge  huge grand challenge of our time. What you can see up here is a map of the world  and we're tracking the spread of this varroa mite. Now  the varroa mite is what changed the game in beekeeping  and you can see  at the top right  the years are changing  we're coming up to modern times  and you can see the spread of the varroa mite from the early     s through now. It's       and we're pretty much covering Asia.       we saw it spread to Europe and South America  and then  when we get to the     s  and specifically to       the varroa mite finally came to North America and to the United States  and that is when the game changed for honeybees in the United States. Many of us will remember our childhood growing up  maybe you got stung by a bee  you saw bees on flowers. Think of the kids today. Their childhood's a bit different. They don't experience this. The bees just aren't around anymore. So we need bees and they're disappearing and it's a big problem. What can we do here  So  what I do is honeybee research. I got my Ph.D. studying honeybee health. I started in      studying honeybees. In       honeybees started disappearing  so suddenly  like  this little nerd kid going to school working with bugs    Laughter    became very relevant in the world. And it worked out that way. So my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier. I don't research what's killing the bees  per se. I'm not one of the many researchers around the world who's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees. We're looking at ways to make bees healthier through vaccines  through yogurt  like probiotics  and other types of therapies in ways that can be fed orally to bees  and this process is so easy  even a   year old can do it. You just mix up some pollen  sugar and water  and whatever active ingredient you want to put in  and you just give it right to the bees. No chemicals involved  just immune boosters. Humans think about our own health in a prospective way. We exercise  we eat healthy  we take vitamins. Why don't we think about honeybees in that same type of way  Bring them to areas where they're thriving and try to make them healthier before they get sick. I spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines with needles.  Laughter  Like  years  years at the bench   Oh my gosh  it's   a.m. and I'm still pricking bees.   Laughter  And then one day I said   Why don't we just do an oral vaccine   It's like   Ugh   so that's what we do.  Laughter  I'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives  because they can be anything. I mean  really open your mind with this. You can paint a hive to match your home. You can hide a hive inside your home. These are three hives on the rooftop of the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel  and they're beautiful here. I mean  we matched the new color of the inside of their rooms to do some type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets  and these bees are terrific  and they also will use herbs that are growing in the garden. That's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking  and the honey    they do live events    they'll use that honey at their bars. Honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there. We also have a classroom hives project  where    this is a nonprofit venture    we're spreading the word around the world for how honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom or into the museum setting  behind glass  and used as an educational tool. This hive that you see here has been in Fenway High School for many years now. The bees fly right into the outfield of Fenway Park. Nobody notices it. If you're not a flower  these bees do not care about you.  Laughter  They don't. They don't. They'll say   S'cuse me  flying around.   Laughter  Some other images here in telling a part of the story that really made urban beekeeping terrific is in New York City  beekeeping was illegal until     . That's a big problem  because what's going to pollinate all of the gardens and the produce locally  Hands  I mean  locally in Boston  there is a terrific company called Green City Growers  and they are going and pollinating their squash crops by hand with Q Tips  and if they miss that three day window  there's no fruit. Their clients aren't happy  and people go hungry. So this is important. We have also some images of honey from Brooklyn. Now  this was a mystery in the New York Times where the honey was very red  and the New York State forensics department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a maraschino cherry factory down the street.  Laughter  So you can tailor your honey to taste however you want by planting bee friendly flowers. Paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping. They've had hives on the rooftop of their opera house for many years now  and that's what really got people started  thinking   Wow  we can do this  and we should do this.  Also in London  and in Europe across the board  they're very advanced in their use of green rooftops and integrating beehives  and I'll show you an ending note here. I would like to encourage you to open your mind. What can you do to save the bees or to help them or to think of sustainable cities in the future  Well  really  just change your perspective. Try to understand that bees are very important. A bee isn't going to sting you if you see it. The bee dies. Honeybees die when they sting  so they don't want to do it either.  Laughter  It's nothing to panic about. They're all over the city. You could even get your own hive if you want. There are great resources available  and there are even companies that will help get you set up and mentor you and it's important for our educational system in the world for students to learn about agriculture worldwide such as this little girl  who  again  is not even getting stung. Thank you.  Applause  In the past several days  I heard people talking about China. And also  I talked to friends about China and Chinese Internet. Something is very challenging to me. I want to make my friends understand  China is complicated. So I always want to tell the story  like  one hand it is that  the other hand is that. You can't just tell a one sided story. I'll give an example. China is a BRIC country. BRIC country means Brazil  Russia  India and China. This emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy. But at the same time  on the other hand  China is a SICK country  the terminology coined by Facebook IPO papers    file. He said the SICK country means Syria  Iran  China and North Korea. The four countries have no access to Facebook. So basically  China is a SICK BRIC country. Another project was built up to watch China and Chinese Internet. And now  today I want to tell you my personal observation in the past several years  from that wall. So  if you are a fan of the Game of Thrones  you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom. It prevents weird things from the north. Same was true for China. In the north  there was a great wall  Chang Cheng. It protected China from invaders for       years. But China also has a great firewall. That's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world. It's not only to defend the Chinese regime from overseas  from the universal values  but also to prevent China's own citizens to access the global free Internet  and even separate themselves into blocks  not united. So  basically the  Internet  has two Internets. One is the Internet  the other is the Chinanet. But if you think the Chinanet is something like a deadland  wasteland  I think it's wrong. But we also use a very simple metaphor  the cat and the mouse game  to describe in the past    years the continuing fight between Chinese censorship  government censorship  the cat  and the Chinese Internet users. That means us  the mouse. But sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple. So today I want to upgrade it to  .  version. In China  we have     million Internet users. That's the biggest population of Netizens  Internet users  in the whole world. So even though China's is a totally censored Internet  but still  Chinese Internet society is really booming. How to make it  It's simple. You have Google  we have Baidu. You have Twitter  we have Weibo. You have Facebook  we have Renren. You have YouTube  we have Youku and Tudou. The Chinese government blocked every single international Web  .  service  and we Chinese copycat every one. So  that's the kind of the thing I call smart censorship. That's not only to censor you. Sometimes this Chinese national Internet policy is very simple  Block and clone. On the one hand  he wants to satisfy people's need of a social network  which is very important  people really love social networking. But on the other hand  they want to keep the server in Beijing so they can access the data any time they want. That's also the reason Google was pulled out from China  because they can't accept the fact that Chinese government wants to keep the server. Sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands. For example  Mubarak  he shut down the Internet. He wanted to prevent the Netizens  from criticizing  him. But once Netizens can't go online  they go in the street. And now the result is very simple. We all know Mubarak is technically dead. But also  Ben Ali  Tunisian president  didn't follow the second rule. That means keep the server in your hands. He allowed Facebook  a U.S. based service  to continue to stay on inside of Tunisia. So he can't prevent it  his own citizens to post critical videos against his corruption. The same thing happend. He was the first to topple during the Arab Spring. But those two very smart international censorship policies didn't prevent Chinese social media  from  becoming a really public sphere  a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials. Because we have     million microbloggers in China. It's the entire population of the United States. So when these     million people  microbloggers  even they block the tweet in our censored platform. But itself    the Chinanet    but itself can create very powerful energy  which has never happened in the Chinese history.       in July  two  unclear  trains crashed  in Wenzhou  a southern city. Right after the train crash  authorities literally wanted to cover up the train  bury the train. So it angered the Chinese Netizens. The first five days after the train crash  there were    million criticisms of the posting on social media  which never happened in Chinese history. And later this year  the rail minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for    years. And also  recently  very funny debate between the Beijing Environment Ministry and the American Embassy in Beijing because the Ministry blamed the American Embassy for intervening in Chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of Beijing. So  the up is the Embassy data  the PM  . . He showed      they showed it's dangerous for the sensitive group. So a suggestion  it's not good to go outside. But that is the Ministry's data. He shows   . He says it's good. It's good to go outside. But    percent of Chinese microbloggers stand firmly on the Embassy's side. I live in Beijing. Every day  I just watch the American Embassy's data to decide whether I should open my window. Why is Chinese social networking  even within the censorship  so booming  Part of the reason is Chinese languages. You know  Twitter and Twitter clones have a kind of a limitation of     characters. But in English it's    words or a sentence with a short link. Maybe in Germany  in German language  it may be just  Aha   But in Chinese language  it's really about     characters  means a paragraph  a story. You can almost have all the journalistic elements there. For example  this is Hamlet  of Shakespeare. It's the same content. One  you can see exactly one Chinese tweet is equal to  .  English tweets. Chinese is always cheating  right  So because of this  the Chinese really regard this microblogging as a media  not only a headline to media. And also  the clone  Sina company is the guy who cloned Twitter. It even has its own name  with Weibo.  Weibo  is the Chinese translation for  microblog . It has its own innovation. At the commenting area   it makes  the Chinese Weibo more like Facebook  rather than the original Twitter. So these innovations and clones  as the Weibo and microblogging  when it came to China in       it immediately became a media platform itself. It became the media platform of     million readers. It became the media. Anything not mentioned in Weibo  it does not appear to exist for the Chinese public. But also  Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mindsets and Chinese life. For example  they give the voiceless people a channel to make your voice heard. We had a petition system. It's a remedy outside the judicial system  because the Chinese central government wants to keep a myth  The emperor is good. The old local officials are thugs. So that's why the petitioner  the victims  the peasants  want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government  they want the emperor to settle the problem. But when more and more people go to Beijing  they also cause the risk of a revolution. So they send them back in recent years. And even some of them were put into black jails. But now we have Weibo  so I call it the Weibo petition. People just use their cell phones to tweet. So your sad stories  by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters  professors or celebrities. One of them is Yao Chen  she is the most popular microblogger in China  who has about    million followers. They're almost like a national TV station. If you    so a sad story will be picked up by her. So this Weibo social media  even in the censorship  still gave the Chinese a real chance for     million people every day chatting together  talking together. It's like a big TED  right  But also  it is like the first time a public sphere happened in China. Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate and talk to people. But also  the cat  the censorship  is not sleeping. It's so hard to post some sensitive words on the Chinese Weibo. For example  you can't post the name of the president  Hu Jintao  and also you can't post the city of Chongqing  the name  and until recently  you can't search the surname of top leaders. So  the Chinese are very good at these puns and alternative wording and even memes. They even name themselves    you know  use the name of this world changing battle between the grass mud horse and the river crab. The grass mud horse is caon ma  is the phonogram for motherfucker  the Netizens call themselves. River crab is h xi   is the phonogram for harmonization  for censorship. So that's kind of a caon ma versus the h xi   that's very good. So  when some very political  exciting moments happened  you can see on Weibo  you see a lot of very weird stories happened. Weird phrases and words  even if you have a PhD of Chinese language  you can't understand them. But you can't even expand more  no  because Chinese Sina Weibo  when it was founded was exactly one month after the official blocking of Twitter.com. That means from the very beginning  Weibo has already convinced the Chinese government  we will not become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime. For example  anything you want to post  like  get together  or  meet up  or  walk   it is automatically recorded and data mined and reported to a poll for further political analyzing. Even if you want to have some gathering  before you go there  the police are already waiting for you. Why  Because they have the data. They have everything in their hands. So they can use the      scenario data mining of the dissident. So the crackdown is very serious. But I want you to notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat and mouse. The cat is the censorship  but Chinese is not only one cat  but also has local cats. Central cat and local cats. You know  the server is in the  central  cats' hands  so even that    when the Netizens criticize the local government  the local government has not any access to the data in Beijing. Without bribing the central cats  he can do nothing  only apologize. So these three years  in the past three years  social movements about microblogging really changed local government  became more and more transparent  because they can't access the data. The server is in Beijing. The story about the train crash  maybe the question is not about why    million criticisms in five days  but why the Chinese central government allowed the five days of freedom of speech online. It's never happened before. And so it's very simple  because even the top leaders were fed up with this guy  this independent kingdom. So they want an excuse    public opinion is a very good excuse to punish him. But also  the Bo Xilai case recently  very big news  he's a princeling. But from February to April this year  Weibo really became a marketplace of rumors. You can almost joke everything about these princelings  everything  It's almost like you're living in the United States. But if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup about Beijing  you definitely will be arrested. So this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window. So Chinese in China  censorship is normal. Something you find is  freedom is weird. Something will happen behind it. Because he was a very popular Leftist leader  so the central government wanted to purge him  and he was very cute  he convinced all the Chinese people  why he is so bad. So Weibo  the     million public sphere  became a very good  convenient tool for a political fight. But this technology is very new  but technically is very old. It was made famous by Chairman Mao  Mao Zedong  because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the Cultural Revolution to destroy every local government. It's very simple  because Chinese central government doesn't need to even lead the public opinion. They just give them a target window to not censor people. Not censoring in China has become a political tool. So that's the update about this game  cat and mouse. Social media changed Chinese mindset. More and more Chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech and human rights as their birthright  not some imported American privilege. But also  it gave the Chinese a national public sphere for people to  it's like a training of their citizenship  preparing for future democracy. But it didn't change the Chinese political system  and also the Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen its power to counter the local government and the different factions. So  what's the future  After all  we are the mouse. Whatever the future is  we should fight against the  cat . There is not only in China  but also in the United States there are some very small  cute but bad cats. SOPA  PIPA  ACTA  TPP and ITU. And also  like Facebook and Google  they claim they are friends of the mouse  but sometimes we see them dating the cats. So my conclusion is very simple. We Chinese fight for our freedom  you just watch your bad cats. Don't let them hook  up  with the Chinese cats. Only in this way  in the future  we will achieve the dreams of the mouse  that we can tweet anytime  anywhere  without fear. Thank you. Good afternoon. I am not a farmer. I'm not. I'm a parent  I'm a resident and I'm a teacher. And this is my world. And along the way I've started noticing    I'm on my third generation of kids    that they're getting bigger. They're getting sicker. In addition to these complexities  I just learned that    percent of the kids that I see who are labeled learning disabled would not have been had they had proper prenatal nutrition. The realities of my community are simple. They look like this. Kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this. And as jobs continue to leave my community  and energy continues to come in  be exported in  it's no wonder that really some people refer to the South Bronx as a desert. But I'm the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet  so I get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm that I'm hoping to share with you all today. And with that note  I come to you with this belief that kids should not have to leave their communities to live  learn and earn in a better one. So I'm here to tell you a story about me and this wall that I met outside  which I'm now bringing inside. And it starts with three people. The crazy teacher    that's me on the left  I dress up pretty  thank you  my wife  I love you for getting a good suit    my passionate borough president and a guy named George Irwin from Green Living Technologies who helped me with my class and helped me get involved with this patented technology. But it all starts with seeds in classrooms  in my place  which looks like this. And I'm here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp. And that's really what this is all about. And it starts with incredible kids like this  who come early and stay late. All of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners  most come with a lot of handicaps  most are homeless and many are in foster care. Almost all of my kids live below poverty. But with those seeds  from day one  we are growing in my classroom  and this is what it looks like in my classroom. And you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds. And then you notice that those seeds become farms across the Bronx that look like this. But again  I am not a farmer. I'm a teacher. And I don't like weeding  and I don't like back breaking labor. So I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of success into something small  like this  and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it  kids who didn't want to be outside could do it  and everyone could have access. So I called George Irwin  and what do you know  He came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall. And what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences  private based learning. And lo and behold  we gave birth to the first edible wall in New York City. So if you're hungry  get up and eat. You can do it right now. My kids play cow all the time. Okay  But we were just getting started  the kids loved the technology  so we called up George and we said   We gotta learn more   Now  Mayor Bloomberg  thank you very much  we no longer need work permits  which comes with slices and bonded contractors    we're available for you    We decided to go to Boston. And my kids  from the poorest congressional district in America  became the first to install a green wall  designed by a computer  with real live learning tools     stories up    if you're going to go visit it  it's on top of the John Hancock building. But closer to home  we started installing these walls in schools that look like this with lighting like that  real LED stuff    st century technology. And what do you know  We made   st century money  and that was groundbreaking. Wow  This is my harvest  people. And what do you do with this food  You cook it  And those are my heirloom students making heirloom sauce  with plastic forks  and we get it into the cafeteria  and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers. And that is the youngest nationally certified workforce in America with our Bronx Borough President. And what'd we do then  Well  I met nice people like you  and they invited us to the Hamptons. So I call this  from South Bronx to Southampton.  And we started putting in roofs that look like this  and we came in from destitute neighborhoods to start building landscape like this  wow  People noticed. And so we got invited back this past summer  and we actually moved into the Hamptons  payed       dollars a week for a house  and we learned how to surf. And when you can do stuff like this    These are my kids putting in this technology  and when you can build a roof that looks like that on a house that looks like that with sedum that looks like this  this is the new green graffiti. So  you may wonder what does a wall like this really do for kids  besides changing landscapes and mindsets  Okay  I'm going to tell you what it does. It gets me to meet incredible contractors like this  Jim Ellenberger from Ellenberger Services. And this is where it becomes true triple bottom line. Because Jim realized that these kids  my future farmers  really had the skills he needed to build affordable housing for New Yorkers  right in their own neighborhood. And this is what my kids are doing  making living wage. Now  if you're like me  you live in a building  there are seven guys out of work looking to manage a million dollars. I don't have it. But if you need a toilet fixed or  you know  some shelving  I gotta wait six months for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me. That's the beauty of this economy. But my kids are now licensed and bonded in trade. And that's my first student to open up  the first in his family to have a bank account. This immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an ATM. And this is the true triple bottom line  because we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destitute and turn them into something like this with interiors like this. Wow  People noticed. And notice they did. So CNN called  and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer's market. And then when Rockefeller Center said  NBC  could you put this thing up on the walls  We were delighted. But this  I show you  when kids from the poorest congressional district in America can build a    foot by    foot wall  design it  plant it and install it in the heart of New York City  that's a true  s  se puede  moment. Really scholastic  if you ask me. But this is not a Getty image. That's a picture I took of my Bronx Borough President  addressing my kids in his house  not the jailhouse  making them feel a part of it. That's our State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Bob Bieder  coming to my classroom to make my kids feel important. And when the Bronx Borough President shows up and the State Senator comes to our class  believe you me  the Bronx can change attitudes now. We are poised  ready  willing and able to export our talent and diversity in ways we've never even imagined. And when the local senator gets on the scale in public and says he's got to lose weight  so do I  And I tell you what  I'm doing it and so are the kids. Okay  And then celebrities started. Produce Pete can't believe what we grow. Lorna Sass came and donated books. Okay  We're feeding seniors. And when we realized that we were growing for food justice in the South Bronx  so did the international community. And my kids in the South Bronx were repped in the first international green roof conference. And that's just great. Except what about locally  Well  we met this woman  Avis Richards  with the Ground Up Campaign. Unbelievable  Through her  my kids  the most disenfranchised and marginalized  were able to roll out     gardens to New York City public schools. That's triple bottom line  Okay  A year ago today  I was invited to the New York Academy of Medicine. I thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy New York made sense  especially when the resources were free. So thank you all and I love them. They introduced me to the New York City Strategic Alliance for Health  again  free resources  don't waste them. And what do you know  Six months later  my school and my kids were awarded the first ever high school award of excellence for creating a healthy school environment. The greenest class in New York City. But more importantly is my kids learned to get  they learned to give. And we took the money that we made from our farmer's market  and started buying gifts for the homeless and for needy around the world. So we started giving back. And that's when I realized that the greening of America starts first with the pockets  then with the heart and then with the mind. So we were onto something  and we're still onto something. And thank God Trinity Wall Street noticed  because they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine. We're       strong right now. And what does it really do  It teaches kids to re vision their communities  so when they grow up in places like this  they can imagine it like this. And my kids  trained and certified    Ma  you get the tax abatement. Thank you  Mayor Bloomberg    can take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that  and that to me  people  is another true  s  se puede  moment. Now  how does it start  It starts in schools. No more little Knicks and little Nets. Group by broccoli  group by your favorite vegetable  something you can aspire to. Okay  And these are my future farmers of America  growing up in Brook Park on    st Street  the most migrant community in America. When tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this  it's no wonder we get fruit like that. And I love it  And so do they. And we're building teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down. And that's a true  s  se puede  moment. And again  Brook Park feeds hundreds of people without a food stamp or a fingerprint. The poorest congressional district in America  the most migratory community in America  we can do this. Bissel Gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions  moving kids into an economy they never imagined. Now  somewhere over the rainbow  my friends  is the South Bronx of America. And we're doing it. How does it start  Well  look at Jose's attention to detail. Thank God Omar knows that carrots come from the ground  and not aisle   at the supermarket or through a bullet proof window or through a piece of styrofoam. And when Henry knows that green is good  so do I. And when you expand their palates  you expand their vocabulary. And most importantly  when you put big kids together with little kids  you get the big fat white guy out of the middle  which is cool  and you create this kind of accountability amongst peers  which is incredible. God  I'm going to run out of time  so I've gotta keep it moving. But this is my weekly paycheck for kids  that's our green graffiti. This is what we're doing. And behold the glory and bounty that is Bronx County. Nothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other. I gotta tell you  I'm a protective parent. But those kids are the kids who are now putting pumpkin patches on top of trains. We're also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent. We're also becoming children of the corn  creating farms in the middle of Fordham Road for awareness and window bottles out of garbage. Now I don't expect every kid to be a farmer  but I expect you to read about it  write about it  blog about it  offer outstanding customer service. I expect them to be engaged  and man  are they  So that's my incredible classroom  that's the food. Where does it go  Zero miles to plate  right down into the cafeteria. Or more importantly  to local shelters  where most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day. And we're stepping it up. No Air Jordans were ever ruined on my farm. And in his day  a million dollar gardens and incredible installations. Let me tell you something  people. This is a beautiful moment. Black field  brown field  toxic waste field  battlefield    we're proving in the Bronx that you can grow anywhere  on cement. And we take orders for flowers. I'm putting the bake sale to shame. We take orders now. I'm booking for the spring. And these were all grown from seeds. We're learning everything. And again  when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse as this to do something as special as this  we're really creating a moment. Now  you may ask about these kids. Forty percent attendance to    percent attendance. All start overage and under credit. They are now  my first cohort is all in college  earning a living wage. The rest are scheduled to graduate this June. Happy kids  happy families  happy colleagues. Amazed people. The glory and bounty that is Bronx County. Let's talk about mint. Where is my mint  I grow seven kinds of mint in my class. Mojitos  anybody  I'll be at Telepan later. But  understand this is my intellectual Viagra. Ladies and gentlemen  I gotta move quick  but understand this  The borough that gave us baggy pants and funky fresh beats is becoming home to the organic ones. My green  unclear         pounds of vegetables  I'm growing organic citizens  engaged kids. So help us go from this to this. Self sustaining entities     months return on investment  plus we're paying people living wage and health benefits  while feeding people for pennies on the dollar. Martin Luther King said that people need to be uplifted with dignity. So here in New York  I urge you  my fellow Americans  to help us make America great again. It's simple. Share your passion. It's real easy. Go see these two videos  please. One got us invited to the White House  one's a recent incarnation. And most importantly  get the biggest bully out of schools. This has got to go tomorrow. People  you can all do that. Keep kids out of stores that look like this. Make them a healthy plate  especially if you can pick it off the wall in your own classroom    delicioso  Model good behavior. Get them to a green cart. Big kids love strawberries and bananas. Teach them entrepreneurship. Thank God for GrowNYC. Let them cook. Great lunch today  let them do culinary things. But most importantly  just love them. Nothing works like unconditional love. So  my good friend Kermit said it's not easy being green. It's not. I come from a place where kids can buy    flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment  where ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor. Okay  My dear friend Majora Carter once told me  we have everything to gain and nothing to lose. So here  and at a time when we've gone from the audacity to hope to hope for some audacity  I urge you to do something. I urge you to do something. Right now  we're all tadpoles  but I urge you to become a big frog and take that big  green leap. I don't care if you're on the left  on the right  up the middle  wherever. Join me. Use    I've got a lot of energy. Help me use it. We can do something here. And along the way  please take time to smell the flowers  especially if you and your students grew them. I'm Steve Ritz  this is Green Bronx Machine. I've got to say thank you to my wife and family  for my kids  thank you for coming every day  and for my colleagues  believing and supporting me. We are growing our way into a new economy. Thank you  God bless you and enjoy the day. I'm Steve Ritz. S  se puede  Like many of you  I'm one of the lucky people. I was born to a family where education was pervasive. I'm a third generation PhD  a daughter of two academics. In my childhood  I played around in my father's university lab. So it was taken for granted that I attend some of the best universities  which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity. Unfortunately  most of the people in the world are not so lucky. In some parts of the world  for example  South Africa  education is just not readily accessible. In South Africa  the educational system was constructed in the days of apartheid for the white minority. And as a consequence  today there is just not enough spots for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education. That scarcity led to a crisis in January of this year at the University of Johannesburg. There were a handful of positions left open from the standard admissions process  and the night before they were supposed to open that for registration  thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long  hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions. When the gates opened  there was a stampede  and    people were injured and one woman died. She was a mother who gave her life trying to get her son a chance at a better life. But even in parts of the world like the United States where education is available  it might not be within reach. There has been much discussed in the last few years about the rising cost of health care. What might not be quite as obvious to people is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition has been increasing at almost twice the rate  for a total of     percent since     . This makes education unaffordable for many people. Finally  even for those who do manage to get the higher education  the doors of opportunity might not open. Only a little over half of recent college graduates in the United States who get a higher education actually are working in jobs that require that education. This  of course  is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions  but for many others  they do not get the value for their time and their effort. Tom Friedman  in his recent New York Times article  captured  in the way that no one else could  the spirit behind our effort. He said the big breakthroughs are what happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary. I've talked about what's desperately necessary. Let's talk about what's suddenly possible. What's suddenly possible was demonstrated by three big Stanford classes  each of which had an enrollment of         people or more. So to understand this  let's look at one of those classes  the Machine Learning class offered by my colleague and cofounder Andrew Ng. Andrew teaches one of the bigger Stanford classes. It's a Machine Learning class  and it has     people enrolled every time it's offered. When Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public  it had         people registered. So to put that number in perspective  for Andrew to reach that same size audience by teaching a Stanford class  he would have to do that for     years. Of course  he'd get really bored. So  having seen the impact of this  Andrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up  to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could. So we formed Coursera  whose goal is to take the best courses from the best instructors at the best universities and provide it to everyone around the world for free. We currently have    courses on the platform from four universities across a range of disciplines  and let me show you a little bit of an overview of what that looks like. Ezekiel Emanuel  Fifty million people are uninsured. Scott Page  Models help us design more effective institutions and policies. We get unbelievable segregation. Scott Klemmer  So Bush imagined that in the future  you'd wear a camera right in the center of your head. Mitchell Duneier  Mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind ... RG  Hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine. Nick Parlante  For each pixel in the image  set the red to zero. Paul Offit  ... Vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus. Dan Jurafsky  Does Lufthansa serve breakfast and San Jose  Well  that sounds funny. Daphne Koller  So this is which coin you pick  and this is the two tosses. Andrew Ng  So in large scale machine learning  we'd like to come up with computational ... DK  It turns out  maybe not surprisingly  that students like getting the best content from the best universities for free. Since we opened the website in February  we now have         students from     countries. We have  .  million enrollments    million quizzes in the    classes that have launched so far have been submitted  and    million videos have been viewed. But it's not just about the numbers  it's also about the people. Whether it's Akash  who comes from a small town in India and would never have access in this case to a Stanford quality course and would never be able to afford it. Or Jenny  who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master's degree. Or Ryan  who can't go to school  because his immune deficient daughter can't be risked to have germs come into the house  so he couldn't leave the house. I'm really glad to say    recently  we've been in correspondence with Ryan    that this story had a happy ending. Baby Shannon    you can see her on the left    is doing much better now  and Ryan got a job by taking some of our courses. So what made these courses so different  After all  online course content has been available for a while. What made it different was that this was real course experience. It started on a given day  and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments. And these would be real homework assignments for a real grade  with a real deadline. You can see the deadlines and the usage graph. These are the spikes showing that procrastination is global phenomenon. At the end of the course  the students got a certificate. They could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job  and we know many students who did. Some students took their certificate and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled for actual college credit. So these students were really getting something meaningful for their investment of time and effort. Let's talk a little bit about some of the components that go into these courses. The first component is that when you move away from the constraints of a physical classroom and design content explicitly for an online format  you can break away from  for example  the monolithic one hour lecture. You can break up the material  for example  into these short  modular units of eight to    minutes  each of which represents a coherent concept. Students can traverse this material in different ways  depending on their background  their skills or their interests. So  for example  some students might benefit from a little bit of preparatory material that other students might already have. Other students might be interested in a particular enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually. So this format allows us to break away from the one size fits all model of education  and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum. Of course  we all know as educators that students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos. Perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort is that we need to have students who practice with the material in order to really understand it. There's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this. This one that appeared in Science last year  for example  demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice  where students are just supposed to repeat what they already learned gives considerably improved results on various achievement tests down the line than many other educational interventions. We've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform  as well as other forms of practice in many ways. For example  even our videos are not just videos. Every few minutes  the video pauses and the students get asked a question. status quo bias  base rate bias. They're all well documented. So they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior. DK  So here the video pauses  and the student types in the answer into the box and submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention. So they get to try again  and this time they got it right. There's an optional explanation if they want. And now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture. This is a kind of simple question that I as an instructor might ask in class  but when I ask that kind of a question in class     percent of the students are still scribbling the last thing I said     percent are zoned out on Facebook  and then there's the smarty pants in the front row who blurts out the answer before anyone else has had a chance to think about it  and I as the instructor am terribly gratified that somebody actually knew the answer. And so the lecture moves on before  really  most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked. Here  every single student has to engage with the material. And of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story. One needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions  and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions. Now  how do you grade the work of         students if you do not have        TAs  The answer is  you need to use technology to do it for you. Now  fortunately  technology has come a long way  and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework. In addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video  we can also grade math  mathematical expressions as well as mathematical derivations. We can grade models  whether it's financial models in a business class or physical models in a science or engineering class and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments. Let me show you one that's actually pretty simple but fairly visual. This is from Stanford's Computer Science     class  and the students are supposed to color correct that blurry red image. They're typing their program into the browser  and you can see they didn't get it quite right  Lady Liberty is still seasick. And so  the student tries again  and now they got it right  and they're told that  and they can move on to the next assignment. This ability to interact actively with the material and be told when you're right or wrong is really essential to student learning. Now  of course we cannot yet grade the range of work that one needs for all courses. Specifically  what's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work that is so essential in such disciplines as the humanities  the social sciences  business and others. So we tried to convince  for example  some of our humanities faculty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy. That didn't go over really well. So we had to come up with a different solution. And the solution we ended up using is peer grading. It turns out that previous studies show  like this one by Saddler and Good  that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades. It was tried only in small classes  but there it showed  for example  that these student assigned grades on the y axis are actually very well correlated with the teacher assigned grade on the x axis. What's even more surprising is that self grades  where the students grade their own work critically    so long as you incentivize them properly so they can't give themselves a perfect score    are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades. And so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale  and is also a useful learning strategy for the students  because they actually learn from the experience. So we now have the largest peer grading pipeline ever devised  where tens of thousands of students are grading each other's work  and quite successfully  I have to say. But this is not just about students sitting alone in their living room working through problems. Around each one of our courses  a community of students had formed  a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor. What you see here is a self generated map from students in our Princeton Sociology     course  where they have put themselves on a world map  and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort. Students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways. First of all  there was a question and answer forum  where students would pose questions  and other students would answer those questions. And the really amazing thing is  because there were so many students  it means that even if a student posed a question at   o'clock in the morning  somewhere around the world  there would be somebody who was awake and working on the same problem. And so  in many of our courses  the median response time for a question on the question and answer forum was    minutes. Which is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students. And you can see from the student testimonials that students actually find that because of this large online community  they got to interact with each other in many ways that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom. Students also self assembled  without any kind of intervention from us  into small study groups. Some of these were physical study groups along geographical constraints and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets. This is the San Francisco study group  but there were ones all over the world. Others were virtual study groups  sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines  and on the bottom left there  you see our multicultural universal study group where people explicitly wanted to connect with people from other cultures. There are some tremendous opportunities to be had from this kind of framework. The first is that it has the potential of giving us a completely unprecedented look into understanding human learning. Because the data that we can collect here is unique. You can collect every click  every homework submission  every forum post from tens of thousands of students. So you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis driven mode to the data driven mode  a transformation that  for example  has revolutionized biology. You can use these data to understand fundamental questions like  what are good learning strategies that are effective versus ones that are not  And in the context of particular courses  you can ask questions like  what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them  So here's an example of that  also from Andrew's Machine Learning class. This is a distribution of wrong answers to one of Andrew's assignments. The answers happen to be pairs of numbers  so you can draw them on this two dimensional plot. Each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer. The big cross at the top left is where       students gave the exact same wrong answer. Now  if two students in a class of     give the same wrong answer  you would never notice. But when       students give the same wrong answer  it's kind of hard to miss. So Andrew and his students went in  looked at some of those assignments  understood the root cause of the misconception  and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket  which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively. So this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large numbers. Personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well  because it provides us with the potential of solving a    year old problem. Educational researcher Benjamin Bloom  in       posed what's called the   sigma problem  which he observed by studying three populations. The first is the population that studied in a lecture based classroom. The second is a population of students that studied using a standard lecture based classroom  but with a mastery based approach  so the students couldn't move on to the next topic before demonstrating mastery of the previous one. And finally  there was a population of students that were taught in a one on one instruction using a tutor. The mastery based population was a full standard deviation  or sigma  in achievement scores better than the standard lecture based class  and the individual tutoring gives you   sigma improvement in performance. To understand what that means  let's look at the lecture based classroom  and let's pick the median performance as a threshold. So in a lecture based class  half the students are above that level and half are below. In the individual tutoring instruction     percent of the students are going to be above that threshold. Imagine if we could teach so that    percent of our students would be above average. Hence  the   sigma problem. Because we cannot afford  as a society  to provide every student with an individual human tutor. But maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone. So the question is  how can we use technology to push from the left side of the graph  from the blue curve  to the right side with the green curve  Mastery is easy to achieve using a computer  because a computer doesn't get tired of showing you the same video five times. And it doesn't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times  we've seen that in many of the examples that I've shown you. And even personalization is something that we're starting to see the beginnings of  whether it's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum or some of the personalized feedback that we've shown you. So the goal here is to try and push  and see how far we can get towards the green curve. So  if this is so great  are universities now obsolete  Well  Mark Twain certainly thought so. He said that   College is a place where a professor's lecture notes go straight to the students' lecture notes  without passing through the brains of either.  I beg to differ with Mark Twain  though. I think what he was complaining about is not universities but rather the lecture based format that so many universities spend so much time on. So let's go back even further  to Plutarch  who said that   The mind is not a vessel that needs filling  but wood that needs igniting.  And maybe we should spend less time at universities filling our students' minds with content by lecturing at them  and more time igniting their creativity  their imagination and their problem solving skills by actually talking with them. So how do we do that  We do that by doing active learning in the classroom. So there's been many studies  including this one  that show that if you use active learning  interacting with your students in the classroom  performance improves on every single metric    on attendance  on engagement and on learning as measured by a standardized test. You can see  for example  that the achievement score almost doubles in this particular experiment. So maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities. So to summarize  if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free  what would that do  Three things. First it would establish education as a fundamental human right  where anyone around the world with the ability and the motivation could get the skills that they need to make a better life for themselves  their families and their communities. Second  it would enable lifelong learning. It's a shame that for so many people  learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college. By having this amazing content be available  we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted  whether it's just to expand our minds or it's to change our lives. And finally  this would enable a wave of innovation  because amazing talent can be found anywhere. Maybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs is living somewhere in a remote village in Africa. And if we could offer that person an education  they would be able to come up with the next big idea and make the world a better place for all of us. Thank you very much. Before March        I was a photographic retoucher based in New York City. We're pale  gray creatures. We hide in dark  windowless rooms  and generally avoid sunlight. We make skinny models skinnier  perfect skin more perfect  and the impossible possible  and we get criticized in the press all the time  but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography. On March           I watched from home  as the rest of the world did  as the tragic events unfolded in Japan. Soon after  an organization I volunteer with  All Hands Volunteers  were on the ground  within days  working as part of the response efforts. I  along with hundreds of other volunteers  knew we couldn't just sit at home  so I decided to join them for three weeks. On May the   th  I made my way to the town of  funato. It's a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture  about        people  one of the first that was hit by the wave. The waters here have been recorded at reaching over    meters in height  and traveled over two miles inland. As you can imagine  the town had been devastated. We pulled debris from canals and ditches. We cleaned schools. We de mudded and gutted homes ready for renovation and rehabilitation. We cleared tons and tons of stinking  rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant. We got dirty  and we loved it. For weeks  all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things. They'd been finding photos and photo albums and cameras and SD cards. And everyone was doing the same. They were collecting them up  and handing them in to various places around the different towns for safekeeping. Now  it wasn't until this point that I realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt. As they had run from the wave  and for their lives  absolutely everything they had  everything had to be left behind. At the end of my first week there  I found myself helping out in an evacuation center in the town. I was helping clean the onsen  the communal onsen  the huge giant bathtubs. This happened to also be a place in the town where the evacuation center was collecting the photos. This is where people were handing them in  and I was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start hand cleaning them. Now  it was emotional and it was inspiring  and I've always heard about thinking outside the box  but it wasn't until I had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened. As I looked through the photos  there were some were over a hundred years old  some still in the envelope from the processing lab  I couldn't help but think as a retoucher that I could fix that tear and mend that scratch  and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same. So that evening  I just reached out on Facebook and asked a few of them  and by morning the response had been so overwhelming and so positive  I knew we had to give it a go. So we started retouching photos. This was the very first. Not terribly damaged  but where the water had caused that discoloration on the girl's face had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy. Otherwise  that little girl isn't going to look like that little girl anymore  and surely that's as tragic as having the photo damaged. Over time  more photos came in  thankfully  and more retouchers were needed  and so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn  and within five days     people wanted to help from    different countries. Within two weeks  I had     people wanting to join in. Within Japan  by July  we'd branched out to the neighboring town of Rikuzentakata  further north to a town called Yamada. Once a week  we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up  where people were reclaiming their photos. The older ladies sometimes hadn't seen a scanner before  but within    minutes of them finding their lost photo  they could give it to us  have it scanned  uploaded to a cloud server  it would be downloaded by a gaijin  a stranger  somewhere on the other side of the globe  and it'd start being fixed. The time it took  however  to get it back is a completely different story  and it depended obviously on the damage involved. It could take an hour. It could take weeks. It could take months. The kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand drawn  or pieced together  picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn't damaged. It was very time consuming. Now  all these photos had been damaged by water  submerged in salt water  covered in bacteria  in sewage  sometimes even in oil  all of which over time is going to continue to damage them  so hand cleaning them was a huge part of the project. We couldn't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned  dry and reclaimed. Now  we were lucky with our hand cleaning. We had an amazing local woman who guided us. It's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos. As my team leader Wynne once said  it's like doing a tattoo on someone. You don't get a chance to mess it up. The lady who brought us these photos was lucky  as far as the photos go. She had started hand cleaning them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage. She also had duplicates. Areas like her husband and her face  which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix  we could just put them together in one good photo  and remake the whole photo. When she collected the photos from us  she shared a bit of her story with us. Her photos were found by her husband's colleagues at a local fire department in the debris a long way from where the home had once stood  and they'd recognized him. The day of the tsunami  he'd actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed. He had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded. Her two little boys  not so little anymore  but her two boys were both at school  separate schools. One of them got caught up in the water. It took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived. The day I gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son's   th birthday. For her  despite all of this  those photos were the perfect gift back to him  something he could look at again  something he remembered from before that wasn't still scarred from that day in March when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed. After six months in Japan        volunteers had passed through All Hands  hundreds of whom had helped us hand clean over         photographs  the large majority    Applause    a large majority of which did actually find their home again  importantly. Over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get    families hundreds of photographs back  fully restored and retouched. During this time  we hadn't really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials  most of which was printer inks. We take photos constantly. A photo is a reminder of someone or something  a place  a relationship  a loved one. They're our memory keepers and our histories  the last thing we would grab and the first thing you'd go back to look for. That's all this project was about  about restoring those little bits of humanity  giving someone that connection back. When a photo like this can be returned to someone like this  it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it. The project's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers. For some of them  it's given them a connection to something bigger  giving something back  using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin. I would like to conclude by reading an email I got from one of them  Cindy  the day I finally got back from Japan after six months.  As I worked  I couldn't help but think about the individuals and the stories represented in the images. One in particular  a photo of women of all ages  from grandmother to little girl  gathered around a baby  struck a chord  because a similar photo from my family  my grandmother and mother  myself  and newborn daughter  hangs on our wall. Across the globe  throughout the ages  our basic needs are just the same  aren't they   Thank you.  Applause  I thought if I skipped it might help my nerves  but I'm actually having a paradoxical reaction to that  so that was a bad idea.  Laughter  Anyway  I was really delighted to receive the invitation to present to you some of my music and some of my work as a composer  presumably because it appeals to my well known and abundant narcissism.  Laughter  And I'm not kidding  I just think we should just say that and move forward.  Laughter  So  but the thing is  a dilemma quickly arose  and that is that I'm really bored with music  and I'm really bored with the role of the composer  and so I decided to put that idea  boredom  as the focus of my presentation to you today. And I'm going to share my music with you  but I hope that I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story  tells a story about how I used boredom as a catalyst for creativity and invention  and how boredom actually forced me to change the fundamental question that I was asking in my discipline  and how boredom also  in a sense  pushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort of most traditional  narrow definition of a composer. What I'd like to do today is to start with an excerpt of a piece of music at the piano. Okay  I wrote that.  Laughter  No  it's not    Applause  Oh  why thank you. No  no  I didn't write that. In fact  that was a piece by Beethoven  and so I was not functioning as a composer. Just now I was functioning in the role of the interpreter  and there I am  interpreter. So  an interpreter of what  Of a piece of music  right  But we can ask the question   But is it music   And I say this rhetorically  because of course by just about any standard we would have to concede that this is  of course  a piece of music  but I put this here now because  just to set it in your brains for the moment  because we're going to return to this question. It's going to be a kind of a refrain as we go through the presentation. So here we have this piece of music by Beethoven  and my problem with it is  it's boring. I mean  you   I'm just like  a hush  huh    It's like     Laughter  It's Beethoven  how can you say that  No  well  I don't know  it's very familiar to me. I had to practice it as a kid  and I'm really sick of it. So     Laughter  I would  so what I might like to try to do is to change it  to transform it in some ways  to personalize it  so I might take the opening  like this idea    and then I might substitute     Music  and then I might improvise on that melody that goes forward from there     Music  So that might be the kind of thing    Why thank you. That would be the kind of thing that I would do  and it's not necessarily better than the Beethoven. In fact  I think it's not better than it. The thing is     Laughter     it's more interesting to me. It's less boring for me. I'm really leaning into me  because I  because I have to think about what decisions I'm going to make on the fly as that Beethoven text is running in time through my head and I'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations I'm going to make to it. So this is an engaging enterprise for me  and I've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there  and now my face appears twice  so I think we can agree that this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise.  Laughter  But it's an engaging one  and it's interesting to me for a while  but then I get bored with it  and by it  I actually mean  the piano  because it becomes  it's this familiar instrument  it's timbral range is actually pretty compressed  at least when you play on the keyboard  and if you're not doing things like listening to it after you've lit it on fire or something like that  you know. It gets a little bit boring  and so pretty soon I go through other instruments  they become familiar  and eventually I find myself designing and constructing my own instrument  and I brought one with me today  and I thought I would play a little bit on it for you so you can hear what it sounds like. You gotta have doorstops  that's important.  Laughter  I've got combs. They're the only combs that I own.  Music  They're all mounted on my instruments.  Laughter  I can actually do all sorts of things. I can play with a violin bow. I don't have to use the chopsticks. So we have this sound.  Music  And with a bank of live electronics  I can change the sounds radically.  Music  Like that  and like this.  Music  And so forth. So this gives you a little bit of an idea of the sound world of this instrument  which I think is quite interesting and it puts me in the role of the inventor  and the nice thing about   This instrument is called the Mouseketeer ...  Laughter  and the cool thing about it is I'm the world's greatest Mouseketeer player.  Laughter  Okay   Applause  So in that regard  this is one of the things  this is one of the privileges of being  and here's another role  the inventor  and by the way  when I told you that I'm the world's greatest  if you're keeping score  we've had narcissism and solipsism and now a healthy dose of egocentricism. I know some of you are just  you know  bingo  Or  I don't know.  Laughter  Anyway  so this is also a really enjoyable role. I should concede also that I'm the world's worst Mouseketeer player  and it was this distinction that I was most worried about when I was on that prior side of the tenure divide. I'm glad I'm past that. We're not going to go into that. I'm crying on the inside. There are still scars. Anyway  but I guess my point is that all of these enterprises are engaging to me in their multiplicity  but as I've presented them to you today  they're actually solitary enterprises  and so pretty soon I want to commune with other people  and so I'm delighted that in fact I get to compose works for them. I get to write  sometimes for soloists and I get to work with one person  sometimes full orchestras  and I work with a lot of people  and this is probably the capacity  the role creatively for which I'm probably best known professionally. Now  some of my scores as a composer look like this  and others look like this  and some look like this  and I make all of these by hand  and it's really tedious. It takes a long  long time to make these scores  and right now I'm working on a piece that's     pages in length  and it's just a big chunk of my life  and I'm just pulling out hair. I have a lot of it  and that's a good thing I suppose.  Laughter  So this gets really boring and really tiresome for me  so after a while the process of notating is not only boring  but I actually want the notation to be more interesting  and so that's pushed me to do other projects like this one. This is an excerpt from a score called  The Metaphysics of Notation.  The full score is    feet wide. It's a bunch of crazy pictographic notation. Let's zoom in on one section of it right here. You can see it's rather detailed. I do all of this with drafting templates  with straight edges  with French curves  and by freehand  and the    feet was actually split into    six foot wide panels that were installed around the Cantor Arts Center Museum lobby balcony  and it appeared for one year in the museum  and during that year  it was experienced as visual art most of the week  except  as you can see in these pictures  on Fridays  from noon til one  and only during that time  various performers came and interpreted these strange and undefined pictographic glyphs.  Laughter  Now this was a really exciting experience for me. It was gratifying musically  but I think the more important thing is it was exciting because I got to take on another role  especially given that it appeared in a museum  and that is as visual artist.  Laughter  We're going to fill up the whole thing  don't worry.  Laughter  I am multitudes.  Laughter  So one of the things is that  I mean  some people would say  like   Oh  you're being a dilettante   and maybe that's true. I can understand how  I mean  because I don't have a pedigree in visual art and I don't have any training  but it's just something that I wanted to do as an extension of my composition  as an extension of a kind of creative impulse. I can understand the question  though.  But is it music   I mean  there's not any traditional notation. I can also understand that sort of implicit criticism in this piece   S tog   which I made when I was living in Copenhagen. I took the Copenhagen subway map and I renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations  and the players  who are synchronized with stopwatches  follow the timetables  which are listed in minutes past the hour. So this is a case of actually adapting something  or maybe stealing something  and then turning it into a musical notation. Another adaptation would be this piece. I took the idea of the wristwatch  and I turned it into a musical score. I made my own faces  and had a company fabricate them  and the players follow these scores. They follow the second hands  and as they pass over the various symbols  the players respond musically. Here's another example from another piece  and then its realization. So in these two capacities  I've been scavenger  in the sense of taking  like  the subway map  right  or thief maybe  and I've also been designer  in the case of making the wristwatches. And once again  this is  for me  interesting. Another role that I like to take on is that of the performance artist. Some of my pieces have these kind of weird theatric elements  and I often perform them. I want to show you a clip from a piece called  Echolalia.  This is actually being performed by Brian McWhorter  who is an extraordinary performer. Let's watch a little bit of this  and please notice the instrumentation. Okay  I hear you were laughing nervously because you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp  the intonation was a little questionable.  Laughter  Let's watch just another clip. You can see the mayhem continues  and there's  you know  there were no clarinets and trumpets and flutes and violins. Here's a piece that has an even more unusual  more peculiar instrumentation. This is  Tl n   for three conductors and no players.  Laughter  This was based on the experience of actually watching two people having a virulent argument in sign language  which produced no decibels to speak of  but affectively  psychologically  was a very loud experience. So  yeah  I get it  with  like  the weird appliances and then the total absence of conventional instruments and this glut of conductors  people might  you know  wonder  yeah   Is this music   But let's move on to a piece where clearly I'm behaving myself  and that is my  Concerto for Orchestra.  You're going to notice a lot of conventional instruments in this clip.  Music  This  in fact  is not the title of this piece. I was a bit mischievous. In fact  to make it more interesting  I put a space right in here  and this is the actual title of the piece. Let's continue with that same excerpt. It's better with a florist  right   Laughter   Music  Or at least it's less boring. Let's watch a couple more clips. So with all these theatric elements  this pushes me in another role  and that would be  possibly  the dramaturge. I was playing nice. I had to write the orchestra bits  right  Okay  But then there was this other stuff  right  There was the florist  and I can understand that  once again  we're putting pressure on the ontology of music as we know it conventionally  but let's look at one last piece today I'm going to share with you. This is going to be a piece called  Aphasia   and it's for hand gestures synchronized to sound  and this invites yet another role  and final one I'll share with you  which is that of the choreographer. And the score for the piece looks like this  and it instructs me  the performer  to make various hand gestures at very specific times synchronized with an audio tape  and that audio tape is made up exclusively of vocal samples. I recorded an awesome singer  and I took the sound of his voice in my computer  and I warped it in countless ways to come up with the soundtrack that you're about to hear. And I'll perform just an excerpt of  Aphasia  for you here. Okay  So that gives you a little taste of that piece.  Applause  Yeah  okay  that's kind of weird stuff. Is it music  Here's how I want to conclude. I've decided  ultimately  that this is the wrong question  that this is not the important question. The important question is   Is it interesting   And I follow this question  not worrying about  Is it music      not worrying about the definition of the thing that I'm making. I allow my creativity to push me in directions that are simply interesting to me  and I don't worry about the likeness of the result to some notion  some paradigm  of what music composition is supposed to be  and that has actually urged me  in a sense  to take on a whole bunch of different roles  and so what I want you to think about is  to what extent might you change the fundamental question in your discipline  and  okay  I'm going to put one extra little footnote in here  because  like  I realized I mentioned some psychological defects earlier  and we also  along the way  had a fair amount of obsessive behavior  and there was some delusional behavior and things like that  and here I think we could say that this is an argument for self loathing and a kind of schizophrenia  at least in the popular use of the term  and I really mean dissociative identity disorder  okay.  Laughter  Anyway  despite those perils  I would urge you to think about the possibility that you might take on roles in your own work  whether they are neighboring or far flung from your professional definition. And with that  I thank you very much.  Applause  In half a century of trying to help prevent wars  there's one question that never leaves me  How do we deal with extreme violence without using force in return  When you're faced with brutality  whether it's a child facing a bully on a playground or domestic violence    or  on the streets of Syria today  facing tanks and shrapnel  what's the most effective thing to do  Fight back  Give in  Use more force  This question   How do I deal with a bully without becoming a thug in return   has been with me ever since I was a child. I remember I was about     glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents' living room as Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest  and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting mown down. And I rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase. And my mother came up and said   What on Earth are you doing   And I said   I'm going to Budapest.  And she said   What on Earth for   And I said   Kids are getting killed there. There's something terrible happening.  And she said   Don't be so silly.  And I started to cry. And she got it  she said   Okay  I see it's serious. You're much too young to help. You need training. I'll help you. But just unpack your suitcase.  And so I got some training and went and worked in Africa during most of my   s. But I realized that what I really needed to know I couldn't get from training courses. I wanted to understand how violence  how oppression  works. And what I've discovered since is this  Bullies use violence in three ways. They use political violence to intimidate  physical violence to terrorize and mental or emotional violence to undermine. And only very rarely in very few cases does it work to use more violence. Nelson Mandela went to jail believing in violence  and    years later he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills  the incredible skills  that they needed to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known into a democracy. And they did it in a total devotion to non violence. They realized that using force against force doesn't work. So what does work  Over time I've collected about a half dozen methods that do work    of course there are many more    that do work and that are effective. And the first is that the change that has to take place has to take place here  inside me. It's my response  my attitude  to oppression that I've got control over  and that I can do something about. And what I need to develop is self knowledge to do that. That means I need to know how I tick  when I collapse  where my formidable points are  where my weaker points are. When do I give in  What will I stand up for  And meditation or self inspection is one of the ways    again it's not the only one    it's one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power. And my heroine here    like Satish's    is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma. She was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of Rangoon. They came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns. And she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers were more scared than the student protesters behind her. But she told the students to sit down. And she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun  put her hand on it and lower it. And no one got killed. So that's what the mastery of fear can do    not only faced with machine guns  but if you meet a knife fight in the street. But we have to practice. So what about our fear  I have a little mantra. My fear grows fat on the energy I feed it. And if it grows very big it probably happens. So we all know the three o'clock in the morning syndrome  when something you've been worrying about wakes you up    I see a lot of people    and for an hour you toss and turn  it gets worse and worse  and by four o'clock you're pinned to the pillow by a monster this big. The only thing to do is to get up  make a cup of tea and sit down with the fear like a child beside you. You're the adult. The fear is the child. And you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants  what it needs. How can this be made better  How can the child feel stronger  And you make a plan. And you say   Okay  now we're going back to sleep. Half past seven  we're getting up and that's what we're going to do.  I had one of these   a.m. episodes on Sunday    paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you. So I did the thing. I got up  made the cup of tea  sat down with it  did it all and I'm here    still partly paralyzed  but I'm here. So that's fear. What about anger  Wherever there is injustice there's anger. But anger is like gasoline  and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match  you've got an inferno. But anger as an engine    in an engine    is powerful. If we can put our anger inside an engine  it can drive us forward  it can get us through the dreadful moments and it can give us real inner power. And I learned this in my work with nuclear weapon policy makers. Because at the beginning I was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to that I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong. Totally ineffective. In order to develop a dialogue for change we have to deal with our anger. It's okay to be angry with the thing    the nuclear weapons in this case    but it is hopeless to be angry with the people. They are human beings just like us. And they're doing what they think is best. And that's the basis on which we have to talk with them. So that's the third one  anger. And it brings me to the crux of what's going on  or what I perceive as going on  in the world today  which is that last century was top down power. It was still governments telling people what to do. This century there's a shift. It's bottom up or grassroots power. It's like mushrooms coming through concrete. It's people joining up with people  as Bundy just said  miles away to bring about change. And Peace Direct spotted quite early on that local people in areas of very hot conflict know what to do. They know best what to do. So Peace Direct gets behind them to do that. And the kind of thing they're doing is demobilizing militias  rebuilding economies  resettling refugees  even liberating child soldiers. And they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this. And what they've realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less humane  but it's less effective than using methods that connect people with people  that rebuild. And I think that the U.S. military is finally beginning to get this. Up to now their counter terrorism policy has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost  and if civilians get in the way  that's written as  collateral damage.  And this is so infuriating and humiliating for the population of Afghanistan  that it makes the recruitment for al Qaeda very easy  when people are so disgusted by  for example  the burning of the Koran. So the training of the troops has to change. And I think there are signs that it is beginning to change. The British military have always been much better at this. But there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from  and that's a brilliant U.S. lieutenant colonel called Chris Hughes. And he was leading his men down the streets of Najaf    in Iraq actually    and suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road  screaming  yelling  furiously angry  and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified  didn't know what was going on  couldn't speak Arabic. And Chris Hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his head  pointing at the ground  and he said   Kneel.  And these huge soldiers with their backpacks and their body armor  wobbled to the ground. And complete silence fell. And after about two minutes  everybody moved aside and went home. Now that to me is wisdom in action. In the moment  that's what he did. And it's happening everywhere now. You don't believe me  Have you asked yourselves why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed over the last    years  Dictatorships in Czechoslovakia  East Germany  Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania  Mali  Madagascar  Poland  the Philippines  Serbia  Slovenia  I could go on  and now Tunisia and Egypt. And this hasn't just happened. A lot of it is due to a book written by an    year old man in Boston  Gene Sharp. He wrote a book called  From Dictatorship to Democracy  with    methodologies for non violent resistance. And it's been translated into    languages. It's flown around the world. And it's being used by young people and older people everywhere  because it works and it's effective. So this is what gives me hope    not just hope  this is what makes me feel very positive right now. Because finally human beings are getting it. We're getting practical  doable methodologies to answer my question  How do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug  We're using the kind of skills that I've outlined  inner power    the development of inner power    through self knowledge  recognizing and working with our fear  using anger as a fuel  cooperating with others  banding together with others  courage  and most importantly  commitment to active non violence. Now I don't just believe in non violence. I don't have to believe in it. I see evidence everywhere of how it works. And I see that we  ordinary people  can do what Aung San Suu Kyi and Ghandi and Mandela did. We can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known. And we can organize to overcome oppression by opening our hearts as well as strengthening this incredible resolve. And this open heartedness is exactly what I've experienced in the entire organization of this gathering since I got here yesterday. Thank you. In Oxford in the     s  there was a fantastic doctor  who was very unusual  named Alice Stewart. And Alice was unusual partly because  of course  she was a woman  which was pretty rare in the     s. And she was brilliant  she was one of the  at the time  the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians. She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married  after she had kids  and even after she got divorced and was a single parent  she continued her medical work. And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science  the emerging field of epidemiology  the study of patterns in disease. But like every scientist  she appreciated that to make her mark  what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it. The hard problem that Alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers. Most disease is correlated with poverty  but in the case of childhood cancers  the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families. So  what  she wanted to know  could explain this anomaly  Now  Alice had trouble getting funding for her research. In the end  she got just       pounds from the Lady Tata Memorial prize. And that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data. Now  she had no idea what to look for. This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search  so she asked everything she could think of. Had the children eaten boiled sweets  Had they consumed colored drinks  Did they eat fish and chips  Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing  What time of life had they started school  And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back  one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of. By a rate of two to one  the children who had died had had mothers who had been X rayed when pregnant. Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom. Conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point  a threshold. It flew in the face of conventional wisdom  which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age  which was the X ray machine. And it flew in the face of doctors' idea of themselves  which was as people who helped patients  they didn't harm them. Nevertheless  Alice Stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in The Lancet in     . People got very excited  there was talk of the Nobel Prize  and Alice really was in a big hurry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find before they disappeared. In fact  she need not have hurried. It was fully    years before the British and medical    British and American medical establishments abandoned the practice of X raying pregnant women. The data was out there  it was open  it was freely available  but nobody wanted to know. A child a week was dying  but nothing changed. Openness alone can't drive change. So for    years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands. So  how did she know that she was right  Well  she had a fantastic model for thinking. She worked with a statistician named George Kneale  and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn't. So  Alice was very outgoing and sociable  and George was a recluse. Alice was very warm  very empathetic with her patients. George frankly preferred numbers to people. But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship. He said   My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong.  He actively sought disconfirmation. Different ways of looking at her models  at her statistics  different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her. He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories. Because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong  that George could give Alice the confidence she needed to know that she was right. It's a fantastic model of collaboration    thinking partners who aren't echo chambers. I wonder how many of us have  or dare to have  such collaborators. Alice and George were very good at conflict. They saw it as thinking. So what does that kind of constructive conflict require  Well  first of all  it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves. That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive  which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves  and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds  different disciplines  different ways of thinking and different experience  and find ways to engage with them. That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy. And the more I've thought about this  the more I think  really  that that's a kind of love. Because you simply won't commit that kind of energy and time if you don't really care. And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds. Alice's daughter told me that every time Alice went head to head with a fellow scientist  they made her think and think and think again.  My mother   she said   My mother didn't enjoy a fight  but she was really good at them.  So it's one thing to do that in a one to one relationship. But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face  many of the biggest disasters that we've experienced  mostly haven't come from individuals  they've come from organizations  some of them bigger than countries  many of them capable of affecting hundreds  thousands  even millions of lives. So how do organizations think  Well  for the most part  they don't. And that isn't because they don't want to  it's really because they can't. And they can't because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict. In surveys of European and American executives  fully    percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise. Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke  afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage  and felt that they were bound to lose. Eighty five percent is a really big number. It means that organizations mostly can't do what George and Alice so triumphantly did. They can't think together. And it means that people like many of us  who have run organizations  and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can  mostly fail to get the best out of them. So how do we develop the skills that we need  Because it does take skill and practice  too. If we aren't going to be afraid of conflict  we have to see it as thinking  and then we have to get really good at it. So  recently  I worked with an executive named Joe  and Joe worked for a medical device company. And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on. He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error that could really hurt people. He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help. But when he looked around his organization  nobody else seemed to be at all worried. So  he didn't really want to say anything. After all  maybe they knew something he didn't. Maybe he'd look stupid. But he kept worrying about it  and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved. In the end  Joe and I found a way for him to raise his concerns. And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation. It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts. So now Joe had allies. They could think together. And yes  there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument  but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative  to solve the problem  and to change the device. Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whistle blower  except that like almost all whistle blowers  he wasn't a crank at all  he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served. But he had been so afraid of conflict  until finally he became more afraid of the silence. And when he dared to speak  he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined. And his colleagues don't think of him as a crank. They think of him as a leader. So  how do we have these conversations more easily and more often  Well  the University of Delft requires that its PhD students have to submit five statements that they're prepared to defend. It doesn't really matter what the statements are about  what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority. I think it's a fantastic system  but I think leaving it to PhD candidates is far too few people  and way too late in life. I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development  if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society. The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we've witnessed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden. It comes from information that is freely available and out there  but that we are willfully blind to  because we can't handle  don't want to handle  the conflict that it provokes. But when we dare to break that silence  or when we dare to see  and we create conflict  we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking. Open information is fantastic  open networks are essential. But the truth won't set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it. Openness isn't the end. It's the beginning. So  well  I do applied math  and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math  is that we are like management consultants. No one knows what the hell we do. So I am going to give you some    attempt today to try and explain to you what I do. So  dancing is one of the most human of activities. We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on. Now  ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill  and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it. Now  sadly  neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability  as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling  who was a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time. So great progress and treatment has been made over the years. However  there are  .  million people worldwide who have the disease  and they have to live with incurable weakness  tremor  rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease  so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late. We need to be able to measure progression objectively  and ultimately  the only way we're going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure. But frustratingly  with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders  there are no biomarkers  so there's no simple blood test that you can do  and the best that we have is like this    minute neurologist test. You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very  very costly  and that means that  outside the clinical trials  it's just never done. It's never done. But what if patients could do this test at home  Now  that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic  and what if patients could do that test themselves  right  No expensive staff time required. Takes about       by the way  in the neurologist's clinic to do it. So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this  because  you see  in one sense  at least  we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling. So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds. Now  this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds  and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers  because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds  and we all actually have the genes for it. FoxP   for example. And like ballet  it takes an extraordinary level of training. I mean  just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak. From the sound  we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates  and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's  so too are the vocal organs. So on the bottom trace  you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor. We see all the same symptoms. We see vocal tremor  weakness and rigidity. The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while  and that's one of the example symptoms of it. So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle  in some cases  but with any digital microphone  and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning  which is very advanced by now  we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone. So these voice based tests  how do they stack up against expert clinical tests  We'll  they're both non invasive. The neurologist's test is non invasive. They both use existing infrastructure. You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it. And they're both accurate. Okay  but in addition  voice based tests are non expert. That means they can be self administered. They're high speed  take about    seconds at most. They're ultra low cost  and we all know what happens. When something becomes ultra low cost  it becomes massively scalable. So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now. We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients. No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup. We can do high frequency monitoring to get objective data. We can perform low cost mass recruitment for clinical trials  and we can make population scale screening feasible for the first time. We have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late. So  taking the first steps towards this today  we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative. With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe  we're aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals. We have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet. Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in  cheaply  and leave recordings  a few cents each  and I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours. Thank you.  Applause  Tom Rielly  So Max  by taking all these samples of  let's say         people  you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not  What are you going to get out of those samples  Max Little  Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that  during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not  you see. TR  Right. ML  You see  some people may not do it. They may not get through it. But we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances  and it's getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors  and looking for the actual markers of the disease. TR  So you're    percent accurate right now  ML  It's much better than that. Actually  my student Thanasis  I have to plug him  because he's done some fantastic work  and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well  which enables this project  and we're getting    percent accuracy. TR  Ninety nine. Well  that's an improvement. So what that means is that people will be able to   ML   Laughs  TR  People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test  and people with Parkinson's could call in  record their voice  and then their doctor can check up on their progress  see where they're doing in this course of the disease. ML  Absolutely. TR  Thanks so much. Max Little  everybody. ML  Thanks  Tom.  Applause  The will to live life differently can start in some of the most unusual places. This is where I come from  Todmorden. It's a market town in the north of England         people  between Leeds and Manchester  fairly normal market town. It used to look like this  and now it's more like this  with fruit and veg and herbs sprouting up all over the place. We call it propaganda gardening.  Laughter  Corner row railway  station car park  front of a health center  people's front gardens  and even in front of the police station.  Laughter  We've got edible canal towpaths  and we've got sprouting cemeteries. The soil is extremely good.  Laughter  We've even invented a new form of tourism. It's called vegetable tourism  and believe it or not  people come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds  even when there's not much growing.  Laughter  But it starts a conversation.  Laughter  And  you know  we're not doing it because we're bored.  Laughter  We're doing it because we want to start a revolution. We tried to answer this simple question  Can you find a unifying language that cuts across age and income and culture that will help people themselves find a new way of living  see spaces around them differently  think about the resources they use differently  interact differently  Can we find that language  And then  can we replicate those actions  And the answer would appear to be yes  and the language would appear to be food. So  three and a half years ago  a few of us sat around a kitchen table and we just invented the whole thing.  Laughter  We came up with a really simple game plan that we put to a public meeting. We did not consult. We did not write a report. Enough of all that.  Laughter  And we said to that public meeting in Todmorden  look  let's imagine that our town is focused around three plates  a community plate  the way we live our everyday lives  a learning plate  what we teach our kids in school and what new skills we share amongst ourselves  and business  what we do with the pound in our pocket and which businesses we choose to support. Now  let's imagine those plates agitated with community actions around food. If we start one of those community plates spinning  that's really great  that really starts to empower people  but if we can then spin that community plate with the learning plate  and then spin it with the business plate  we've got a real show there  we've got some action theater. We're starting to build resilience ourselves. We're starting to reinvent community ourselves  and we've done it all without a flipping strategy document. And here's the thing as well. We've not asked anybody's permission to do this  we're just doing it.  Laughter  And we are certainly not waiting for that check to drop through the letterbox before we start  and most importantly of all  we are not daunted by the sophisticated arguments that say   These small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow's problems   because I have seen the power of small actions  and it is awesome. So  back to the public meeting.  Laughter  We put that proposition to the meeting  two seconds  and then the room exploded. I have never  ever experienced anything like that in my life. And it's been the same in every single room  in every town that we've ever told our story. People are ready and respond to the story of food. They want positive actions they can engage in  and in their bones  they know it's time to take personal responsibility and invest in more kindness to each other and to the environment. And since we had that meeting three and a half years ago  it's been a heck of a roller coaster. We started with a seed swap  really simple stuff  and then we took an area of land  a strip on the side of our main road  which was a dog toilet  basically  and we turned it into a really lovely herb garden. We took the corner of the car park in the station that you saw  and we made vegetable beds for everybody to share and pick from themselves. We went to the doctors. We've just had a   million pound health center built in Todmorden  and for some reason that I cannot comprehend  it has been surrounded by prickly plants.  Laughter  So we went to the doctors  said   Would you mind us taking them up   They said   Absolutely fine  provided you get planning permission and you do it in Latin and you do it in triplicate   so we did    Laughter    and now there are fruit trees and bushes and herbs and vegetables around that doctor's surgery. And there's been lots of other examples  like the corn that was in front of the police station  and the old people's home that we've planted it with food that they can pick and grow. But it isn't just about growing  because we all are part of this jigsaw. It's about taking those artistic people in your community and doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds to explain to people what's growing there  because there's so many people that don't really recognize a vegetable unless it's in a bit of plastic with a bit of an instruction packet on the top.  Laughter  So we have some people who designed these things   If it looks like this  please don't pick it  but if it looks like this  help yourself.  This is about sharing and investing in kindness. And for those people that don't want to do either of those things  maybe they can cook  so we pick them seasonally and then we go on the street  or in the pub  or in the church  or wherever people are living their lives. This is about us going to the people and saying   We are all part of the local food jigsaw  we are all part of a solution.  And then  because we know we've got vegetable tourists and we love them to bits and they're absolutely fantastic  we thought  what could we do to give them an even better experience  So we invented  without asking  of course  the Incredible Edible Green Route. And this is a route of exhibition gardens  and edible towpaths  and bee friendly sites  and the story of pollinators  and it's a route that we designed that takes people through the whole of our town  past our cafes and our small shops  through our market  not just to and fro from the supermarket  and we're hoping that  in changing people's footfall around our town  we're also changing their behavior. And then there's the second plate  the learning plate. Well  we're in partnership with a high school. We've created a company. We are designing and building an aquaponics unit in some land that was spare at the back of the high school  like you do  and now we're going to be growing fish and vegetables in an orchard with bees  and the kids are helping us build that  and the kids are on the board  and because the community was really keen on working with the high school  the high school is now teaching agriculture  and because it's teaching agriculture  we started to think  how could we then get those kids that never had a qualification before in their lives but are really excited about growing  how can we give them some more experience  So we got some land that was donated by a local garden center. It was really quite muddy  but in a truly incredible way  totally voluntary led  we have turned that into a market garden training center  and that is polytunnels and raised beds and all the things you need to get the soil under your fingers and think maybe there's a job in this for me in the future. And because we were doing that  some local academics said   You know  we could help design a commercial horticulture course for you. There's not one that we know of.  So they're doing that  and we're going to launch it later this year  and it's all an experiment  and it's all voluntary. And then there's the third plate  because if you walk through an edible landscape  and if you're learning new skills  and if you start to get interested in what's growing seasonally  you might just want to spend more of your own money in support of local producers  not just veg  but meat and cheese and beer and whatever else it might be. But then  we're just a community group  you know. We're just all volunteers. What could we actually do  So we did some really simple things. We fundraised  we got some blackboards  we put  Incredible Edible  on the top  we gave it every market trader that was selling locally  and they scribbled on what they were selling in any one week. Really popular. People congregated around it. Sales were up. And then  we had a chat with the farmers  and we said   We're really serious about this   but they didn't actually believe us  so we thought  okay  what should we do  I know. If we can create a campaign around one product and show them there is local loyalty to that product  maybe they'll change their mind and see we're serious. So we launched a campaign    because it just amuses me    called Every Egg Matters.  Laughter  And what we did was we put people on our egg map. It's a stylized map of Togmorden. Anybody that's selling their excess eggs at the garden gate  perfectly legally  to their neighbors  we've stuck on there. We started with four  and we've now got    on  and the result of that was that people were then going into shops asking for a local Todmorden egg  and the result of that was  some farmers upped the amount of flocks they got of free range birds  and then they went on to meat birds  and although these are really  really small steps  that increasing local economic confidence is starting to play out in a number of ways  and we now have farmers doing cheese and they've upped their flocks and rare breed pigs  they're doing pasties and pies and things that they would have never done before. We've got increasing market stalls selling local food  and in a survey that local students did for us     percent of all food traders in that town said that their bottom line had increased because of what we were actually doing. And we're just volunteers and it's only an experiment. Now  none of this is rocket science. It certainly is not clever  and it's not original. But it is joined up  and it is inclusive. This is not a movement for those people that are going to sort themselves out anyway. This is a movement for everyone. We have a motto  If you eat  you're in.  Laughter  Across age  across income  across culture. It's been really quite a roller coaster experience  but going back to that first question that we asked  is it replicable  Yeah. It most certainly is replicable. More than    towns in England now are spinning the Incredible Edible plate. Whichever way they want to do it  of their own volition  they're trying to make their own lives differently  and worldwide  we've got communities across America and Japan    it's incredible  isn't it  I mean  America and Japan and New Zealand. People after the earthquake in New Zealand visited us in order to incorporate some of this public spiritedness around local growing into the heart of Christchurch. And none of this takes more money and none of this demands a bureaucracy  but it does demand that you think things differently and you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs in order to create that supportive framework that communities can bounce off. And there's some great ideas already in our patch. Our local authority has decided to make everywhere Incredible Edible  and in support of that have decided to do two things. First  they're going to create an asset register of spare land that they've got  put it in a food bank so that communities can use that wherever they live  and they're going to underpin that with a license. And then they've said to every single one of their workforce  if you can  help those communities grow  and help them to maintain their spaces. Suddenly  we're seeing actions on the ground from local government. We're seeing this mainstreamed. We are responding creatively at last to what Rio demanded of us  and there's lots more you could do. I mean  just to list a few. One  please stop putting prickly plants around public buildings. It's a waste of space. edible landscapes so that our children start to walk past their food day in  day out  on our high streets  in our parks  wherever that might be. Inspire local planners to put the food sites at the heart of the town and the city plan  not relegate them to the edges of the settlements that nobody can see. Encourage all our schools to take this seriously. This isn't a second class exercise. If we want to inspire the farmers of tomorrow  then please let us say to every school  create a sense of purpose around the importance to the environment  local food and soils. Put that at the heart of your school culture  and you will create a different generation. There are so many things you can do  but ultimately this is about something really simple. Through an organic process  through an increasing recognition of the power of small actions  we are starting  at last  to believe in ourselves again  and to believe in our capacity  each and every one of us  to build a different and a kinder future  and in my book  that's incredible. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  We're going to begin in     . Bob Dylan is    years old  and his career is just reaching its pinnacle. He's been christened the voice of a generation  and he's churning out classic songs at a seemingly impossible rate  but there's a small minority of dissenters  and they claim that Bob Dylan is stealing other people's songs.     . Brian Burton  aka Danger Mouse  takes the Beatles'  White Album   combines it with Jay Z's  The Black Album  to create  The Grey Album.   The Grey Album  becomes an immediate sensation online  and the Beatles' record company sends out countless cease and desist letters for  unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property.  Now   The Grey Album  is a remix. It is new media created from old media. It was made using these three techniques  copy  transform and combine. It's how you remix. You take existing songs  you chop them up  you transform the pieces  you combine them back together again  and you've got a new song  but that new song is clearly comprised of old songs. But I think these aren't just the components of remixing. I think these are the basic elements of all creativity. I think everything is a remix  and I think this is a better way to conceive of creativity. All right  let's head back to       and let's hear where some of Dylan's early songs came from. We'll do some side by side comparisons here. All right  this first song you're going to hear is  Nottamun Town.  It's a traditional folk tune. After that  you'll hear Dylan's  Masters of War.  Jean Ritchie    In Nottamun Town  not a soul would look out      not a soul would look up  not a soul would look down.   Bob Dylan    Come you masters of war      you that build the big guns  you that build the death planes      You that build all the bombs.   Kirby Ferguson  Okay  so that's the same basic melody and overall structure. This next one is  The Patriot Game   by Dominic Behan. Alongside that  you're going to hear  With God on Our Side   by Dylan. Dominic Behan    Come all ye young rebels      and list while I sing      for the love of one's land is a terrible thing.   BD    Oh my name it is nothin'      my age it means less      the country I come from is called the Midwest.   KF  Okay  so in this case  Dylan admits he must have heard  The Patriot Game   he forgot about it  then when the song kind of bubbled back up in his brain  he just thought it was his song. Last one  this is  Who's Going To Buy You Ribbons   another traditional folk tune. Alongside that is  Don't Think Twice  It's All Right.  This one's more about the lyric. Paul Clayton    It ain't no use to sit and sigh now      darlin'  and it ain't no use to sit and cry now.   BD    It ain t no use to sit and wonder why  babe      if you don't know by now      and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why  babe      it'll never do somehow.   KF  Okay  now  there's a lot of these. It's been estimated that two thirds of the melodies Dylan used in his early songs were borrowed. This is pretty typical among folk singers. Here's the advice of Dylan's idol  Woody Guthrie.  The worlds are the important thing. Don't worry about tunes. Take a tune  sing high when they sing low  sing fast when they sing slow  and you've got a new tune.  And that's  that's what Guthrie did right here  and I'm sure you all recognize the results. We know this tune  right  We know it  Actually you don't. That is  When the World's on Fire   a very old melody  in this case performed by the Carter Family. Guthrie adapted it into  This Land Is Your Land.  So  Bob Dylan  like all folk singers  he copied melodies  he transformed them  he combined them with new lyrics which were frequently their own concoction of previous stuff. Now  American copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others. Instead  these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property. Now  creative works may indeed be kind of like property  but it's property that we're all building on  and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared. Henry Ford once said   I invented nothing new. I simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work. Progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable.      . The iPhone makes it debut. Apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early  but its time was approaching because its core technology had been evolving for decades. That's multi touch  controlling a device by touching its display. Here is Steve Jobs introducing multi touch and making a rather foreboding joke. Steve Jobs  And we have invented a new technology called multi touch. You can do multi fingered gestures on it  and boy have we patented it.  Laughter  KF  Yes. And yet  here is multi touch in action. This is at TED  actually  about a year earlier. This is Jeff Han  and  I mean  that's multi touch. It's the same animal  at least. Let's hear what Jeff Han has to say about this newfangled technology. Jeff Han  Multi touch sensing isn't anything    isn't completely new. I mean  people like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '  s. The technology  you know  isn't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility. KF  So he's pretty frank about it not being new. So it's not multi touch as a whole that's patented. It's the small parts of it that are  and it's in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent  to promote the progress of useful arts. Here is the first ever slide to unlock. That is all there is to it. Apple has patented this. It's a    page software patent  but I will summarize what it covers. Spoiler alert  Unlocking your phone by sliding an icon with your finger.  Laughter  I'm only exaggerating a little bit. It's a broad patent. Now  can someone own this idea  Now  back in the '  s  there were no software patents  and it was Xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface. What if they had patented pop up menus  scrollbars  the desktop with icons that look like folders and sheets of paper  Would a young and inexperienced Apple have survived the legal assault from a much larger and more mature company like Xerox  Now  this idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until you're the one getting remixed. For example ... SJ  I mean  Picasso had a saying. He said   Good artists copy. Great artists steal.  And we have  you know  always been shameless about stealing great ideas. KF  Okay  so that's in '  . Here's in     .  I'm going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product.   I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this.   Laughter  Okay  so in other words  great artists steal  but not from me. Now  behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion We have a strong predisposition towards protecting what we feel is ours. We have no such aversion towards copying what other people have  because we do that nonstop. So here's the sort of equation we're looking at. We've got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property  plus massive rewards or settlements in infringement cases  plus huge legal fees to protect yourself in court  plus cognitive biases against perceived loss. And the sum looks like this. That is the last four years of lawsuits in the realm of smartphones. Is this promoting the progress of useful arts      . Bob Dylan is    years old  and his time in the cultural spotlight is long since past. He records a song called  Blind Willie McTell   named after the blues singer  and the song is a voyage through the past  through a much darker time  but a simpler one  a time when musicians like Willie McTell had few illusions about what they did.  I jump 'em from other writers but I arrange 'em my own way.  I think this is mostly what we do. Our creativity comes from without  not from within. We are not self made. We are dependent on one another  and admitting this to ourselves isn't an embrace of mediocrity and derivativeness. It's a liberation from our misconceptions  and it's an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves and to simply begin. Thank you so much. It was an honor to be here. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  One of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dictionary is  snollygoster.  Just because it sounds so good. And what snollygoster means is  a dishonest politician.  Although there was a   th century newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said   A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office regardless of party  platform or principle  and who  when he wins  gets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumnancy.  Now I have no idea what  talknophical  is. Something to do with words  I assume. But it's very important that words are at the center of politics  and all politicians know they have to try and control language. It wasn't until  for example       that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report the exact words that were said in the debating chamber. And this was actually all down to the bravery of a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby  who took on Parliament. And he was thrown into the Tower of London and imprisoned  but he was brave enough  he was brave enough to take them on  and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won. And it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase  as bold as brass.  Most people think that's down to the metal. It's not. It's down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press. But to really show you how words and politics interact  I want to take you back to the United States of America  just after they'd achieved independence. And they had to face the question of what to call George Washington  their leader. They didn't know. What do you call the leader of a republican country  And this was debated in Congress for ages and ages. And there were all sorts of suggestions on the table  which might have made it. I mean  some people wanted him to be called Chief Magistrate Washington  and other people  His Highness George Washington  and other people  Protector of the Liberties of the People of the United States of America Washington. Not that catchy. Some people just wanted to call him King. They thought it was tried and tested. And they weren't even being monarchical there  they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term. And  you know  it could have worked. And everybody got insanely bored  actually  because this debate went on for three weeks. I read a diary of this poor senator  who just keeps coming back   Still on this subject.  And the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the House of Representatives were against the Senate. The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to get drunk on power. They didn't want to call him King in case that gave him ideas  or his successor ideas. So they wanted to give him the humblest  meagerest  most pathetic title that they could think of. And that title was  President.  President. They didn't invent the title. I mean  it existed before  but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting. It was like the foreman of the jury. And it didn't have much more grandeur than the term  foreman  or  overseer.  There were occasional presidents of little colonial councils and bits of government  but it was really a nothing title. And that's why the Senate objected to it. They said  that's ridiculous  you can't call him President. This guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries. And who's going to take him seriously if he's got a silly little title like President of the United States of America  And after three weeks of debate  in the end the Senate did not cave in. Instead  they agreed to use the title  President  for now  but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn't agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations  whether under republican or monarchical forms of government  whose custom it is to annex  through the office of the Chief Magistrate  titles of respectability    not bloody President    and that in the intercourse with foreign nations  the majesty of the people of the United States may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity  i.e.  we don't want to look like bloody weirdos. Now you can learn three interesting things from this. First of all    and this is my favorite    is that so far as I've ever been able to find out  the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President. Barack Obama  President Obama  is there on borrowed time  just waiting for the Senate to spring into action. Second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure    you can still be waiting     years later. But the third thing you can learn  and this is the really important one  this is the point I want to leave you on  is that the title  President of the United States of America  doesn't sound that humble at all these days  does it  Something to do with the slightly over       nuclear warheads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff. Reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur. And so the Senate won in the end. They got their title of respectability. And also  the Senate's other worry  the appearance of singularity    well  it was a singularity back then. But now  do you know how many nations have a president  A hundred and forty seven. All because they want to sound like the guy who's got the       nuclear warheads  etc. And so  in the end  the Senate won and the House of Representatives lost  because nobody's going to feel that humble when they're told that they are now the President of the United States of America. And that's the important lesson I think you can take away  and the one I want to leave you with. Politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality  but in fact  reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality. Thank you very much. I'm     feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana. The air is thick with heat and dust  and it's hard to breathe. I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness  but I can't see much else. I hear voices talking  but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing  and stone being broken with primitive tools. Like the others  I wear a flickering  cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic  tattered band  and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth. When my hand slips  I suddenly remember a miner I had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft. As I stand talking to you today  these men are still deep in that hole  risking their lives without payment or compensation  and often dying. I got to climb out of that hole  and I got to go home  but they likely never will  because they're trapped in slavery. For the last    years  I've been documenting indigenous cultures in more than    countries on six continents  and in      I had the great honor of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit. Amongst all the astonishing people I met there  I met a supporter of Free the Slaves  an NGO dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery. We started talking about slavery  and really  I started learning about slavery  for I had certainly known it existed in the world  but not to such a degree. After we finished talking  I felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime  and I thought  if I don't know  how many other people don't know  It started burning a hole in my stomach  so within weeks  I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of Free the Slaves and offer them my help. Thus began my journey into modern day slavery. Oddly  I had been to many of these places before. Some I even considered like my second home. But this time  I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet. A conservative estimate tells us there are more than    million people enslaved in the world today. That's double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans Atlantic slave trade. A hundred and fifty years ago  an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an American worker. That equates to about         in today's money. Yet today  entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as    . Astonishingly  slavery generates profits of more than     billion worldwide each year. Many have been tricked by false promises of a good education  a better job  only to find that they're forced to work without pay under the threat of violence  and they cannot walk away. Today's slavery is about commerce  so the goods that enslaved people produce have value  but the people producing them are disposable. Slavery exists everywhere  nearly  in the world  and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world. In India and Nepal  I was introduced to the brick kilns. This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or Dante's Inferno. Enveloped in temperatures of     degrees  men  women  children  entire families in fact  were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust  while mechanically stacking bricks on their head  up to    at a time  and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away. Deadened by monotony and exhaustion  they work silently  doing this task over and over for    or    hours a day. There were no breaks for food  no water breaks  and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential. So pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working. Every    minutes  I'd have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it  and as I sat there  I thought  my camera is getting far better treatment than these people. Back in the kilns  I wanted to cry  but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said   Lisa  don't do that. Just don't do that here.  And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this  not just for me  but for them. I couldn't offer them any direct help. I couldn't give them money  nothing. I wasn't a citizen of that country. I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in. I'd have to rely on Free the Slaves to work within the system for their liberation  and I trusted that they would. As for me  I'd have to wait until I got home to really feel my heartbreak. In the Himalayas  I found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below. The big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them  and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth. It's difficult to witness something so overwhelming. How can we affect something so insidious  yet so pervasive  Some don't even know they're enslaved  people working        hours a day without any pay  because this has been the case all their lives. They have nothing to compare it to. When these villagers claimed their freedom  the slaveholders burned down all of their houses. I mean  these people had nothing  and they were so petrified  they wanted to give up  but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere  and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own  so that now they do the same back breaking work  but they do it for themselves  and they get paid for it  and they do it in freedom. Sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery  and because of this worldwide awareness  I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry. In Kathmandu  I was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves. They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty  dimly fluorescent lit basement. This wasn't a brothel  per se. It was more like a restaurant. Cabin restaurants  as they're known in the trade  are venues for forced prostitution. Each has small  private rooms  where the slaves  women  along with young girls and boys  some as young as seven years old  are forced to entertain the clients  encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol. Each cubicle is dark and dingy  identified with a painted number on the wall  and partitioned by plywood and a curtain. The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers. Standing in the near darkness  I remember feeling this quick  hot fear  and in that instant  I could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell. I had only one way out  the stairs from where I'd come in. There were no back doors. There were no windows large enough to climb through. These people have no escape at all  and as we take in such a difficult subject  it's important to note that slavery  including sex trafficking  occurs in our own backyard as well. Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture  in restaurants  in domestic servitude  and the list can go on. Recently  the New York Times reported that between         and         American children are sold into sex slavery every year. It's all around us. We just don't see it. The textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor. I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade. This is a family portrait. The dyed black hands are the father  while the blue and red hands are his sons. They mix dye in these big barrels  and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows  but the dye is toxic. My interpreter told me their stories.  We have no freedom   they said.  We hope still  though  that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing.  It's estimated that more than       children are enslaved on Lake Volta  the largest man made lake in the world. When we first arrived  I went to have a quick look. I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat  two older brothers  some younger kids  makes sense right  Wrong. They were all enslaved. Children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished  and they're forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake  even though they do not know how to swim. This young child is eight years old. He was trembling when our boat approached  frightened it would run over his tiny canoe. He was petrified he would be knocked in the water. The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta often catch the fishing nets  and weary  frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines. Many of them drown. For as long as he can recall  he's been forced to work on the lake. Terrified of his master  he will not run away  and since he's been treated with cruelty all his life  he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages. I met these boys at five in the morning  when they were hauling in the last of their nets  but they had been working since   a.m. in the cold  windy night. And it's important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they're full of fish. I want to introduce you to Kofi. Kofi was rescued from a fishing village. I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery. Here he's seen taking a bath at the well  pouring big buckets of water over his head  and the wonderful news is  as you and I are sitting here talking today  Kofi has been reunited with his family  and what's even better  his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe. Kofi is the embodiment of possibility. Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life  Driving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the Slaves  a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window. He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle. At the end of the road  he urged us out of the car  and told the driver to quickly leave. Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath  and said   This is the path  this is the path. Go.  As we started down the path  we pushed aside the vines blocking the way  and after about an hour of walking in  found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains  so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest. After another two hours of hiking  the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing  and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field  and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring. Many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold  wading in water poisoned by mercury. Mercury is used in the extraction process. These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana. When they came out of the shaft  they were soaking wet from their own sweat. I remember looking into their tired  bloodshot eyes  for many of them had been underground for    hours. The shafts are up to     feet deep  and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area  where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the gold. At first glance  the pounding site seems full of powerful men  but when we look closer  we see some less fortunate working on the fringes  and children too. All of them are victim to injury  illness and violence. In fact  it's very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here  racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years. This is Manuru. When his father died  his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines. When his uncle died  Manuru inherited his uncle's debt  which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines. When I met him  he had been working in the mines for    years  and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident  one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated. On top of that  Manuru has tuberculosis  yet he's still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft. Even still  he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the Slaves  and it's this sort of determination  in the face of unimaginable odds  that fills me with complete awe. I want to shine a light on slavery. When I was working in the field  I brought lots of candles with me  and with the help of my interpreter  I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight  so when it was safe for them  and safe for me  I made these images. They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world. I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them  and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives. I truly believe  if we can see one another as fellow human beings  then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery. These images are not of issues. They are of people  real people  like you and me  all deserving of the same rights  dignity and respect in their lives. There is not a day that goes by that I don't think of these many beautiful  mistreated people I've had the tremendous honor of meeting. I hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them  people like you  and I hope that force will ignite a fire  and that fire will shine a light on slavery  for without that light  the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows. Thank you very much. I'm afraid I'm one of those speakers you hope you're not going to meet at TED. First  I don't have a mobile  so I'm on the safe side. Secondly  a political theorist who's going to talk about the crisis of democracy is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about. And plus  I'm not going to give you any answers. I'm much more trying to add to some of the questions we're talking about. And one of the things that I want to question is this very popular hope these days that transparency and openness can restore the trust in democratic institutions. There is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me. You people  the Church of TED  are a very optimistic community. Basically you believe in complexity  but not in ambiguity. As you have been told  I'm Bulgarian. And according to the surveys  we are marked the most pessimistic people in the world. The Economist magazine recently wrote an article covering one of the recent studies on happiness  and the title was  The Happy  the Unhappy and the Bulgarians.  So now when you know what to expect  let's give you the story. And this is a rainy election day in a small country    that can be my country  but could be also your country. And because of the rain until four o'clock in the afternoon  nobody went to the polling stations. But then the rain stopped  people went to vote. And when the votes had been counted  three fourths of the people have voted with a blank ballot. The government and the opposition  they have been simply paralyzed. Because you know what to do about the protests. You know who to arrest  who to negotiate with. But what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot  So the government decided to have the elections once again. And this time even a greater number     percent of the people  voted with blank ballots. Basically they went to the ballot boxes to tell that they have nobody to vote for. This is the opening of a beautiful novel by Jose Saramago called  Seeing.  But in my view it very well captures part of the problem that we have with democracy in Europe these days. On one level nobody's questioning that democracy is the best form of government. Democracy is the only game in town. The problem is that many people start to believe that it is not a game worth playing. For the last    years  political scientists have observed that there is a constant decline in electoral turnout  and the people who are least interested to vote are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting. I mean the unemployed  the under privileged. And this is a major issue. Because especially now with the economic crisis  you can see that the trust in politics  that the trust in democratic institutions  was really destroyed. According to the latest survey being done by the European Commission     percent of the citizens of Europe believe that there is a growing gap between the opinion of the policy makers and the opinion of the public. Only    percent of Italians and    percent of Greeks believe that their vote matters. Basically people start to understand that they can change governments  but they cannot change policies. And the question which I want to ask is the following  How did it happen that we are living in societies which are much freer than ever before    we have more rights  we can travel easier  we have access to more information    at the same time that trust in our democratic institutions basically has collapsed  So basically I want to ask  What went right and what went wrong in these    years when we talk about democracy  And I'll start with what went right. And the first thing that went right was  of course  these five revolutions which  in my view  very much changed the way we're living and deepened our democratic experience. And the first was the cultural and social revolution of      and     s  which put the individual at the center of politics. It was the human rights moment. Basically this was also a major outbreak  a culture of dissent  a culture of basically non conformism  which was not known before. So I do believe that even things like that are very much the children of '      nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then. But after that you have the market revolution of the     s. And nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it  the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message   The government does not know better.  And you have more choice driven societies. And of course  you have         the end of Communism  the end of the Cold War. And it was the birth of the global world. And you have the Internet. And this is not the audience to which I'm going to preach to what extent the Internet empowered people. It has changed the way we are communicating and basically we are viewing politics. The very idea of political community totally has changed. And I'm going to name one more revolution  and this is the revolution in brain sciences  which totally changed the way we understand how people are making decisions. So this is what went right. But if we're going to see what went wrong  we're going to end up with the same five revolutions. Because first you have the     s and     s  cultural and social revolution  which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose. The very idea  all these collective nouns that we have been taught about    nation  class  family. We start to like divorcing  if we're married at all. All this was very much under attack. And it is so difficult to engage people in politics when they believe that what really matters is where they personally stand. And you have the market revolution of the     s and the huge increase of inequality in societies. Remember  until the     s  the spread of democracy has always been accompanied by the decline of inequality. The more democratic our societies have been  the more equal they have been becoming. Now we have the reverse tendency. The spread of democracy now is very much accompanied by the increase in inequality. And I find this very much disturbing when we're talking about what's going on right and wrong with democracy these days. And if you go to         something that basically you don't expect that anybody's going to criticize    but many are going to tell you   Listen  it was the end of the Cold War that tore the social contract between the elites and the people in Western Europe.  When the Soviet Union was still there  the rich and the powerful  they needed the people  because they feared them. Now the elites basically have been liberated. They're very mobile. You cannot tax them. And basically they don't fear the people. So as a result of it  you have this very strange situation in which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters. So this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore. And when we talk about the Internet  yes  it's true  the Internet connected all of us  but we also know that the Internet created these echo chambers and political ghettos in which for all your life you can stay with the political community you belong to. And it's becoming more and more difficult to understand the people who are not like you. I know that many people here have been splendidly speaking about the digital world and the possibility for cooperation  but  have you  seen what the digital world has done to American politics these days  This is also partly a result of the Internet revolution. This is the other side of the things that we like. And when you go to the brain sciences  what political consultants learned from the brain scientists is don't talk to me about ideas anymore  don't talk to me about policy programs. What really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people. And you have this very strongly to the extent that  even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days  these revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas. Before  revolutions used to have ideological names. They could be communist  they could be liberal  they could be fascist or Islamic. Now the revolutions are called under the medium which is most used. You have Facebook revolutions  Twitter revolutions. The content doesn't matter anymore  the problem is the media. I'm saying this because one of my major points is what went right is also what went wrong. And when we're now trying to see how we can change the situation  when basically we're trying to see what can be done about democracy  we should keep this ambiguity in mind. Because probably some of the things that we love most are going to be also the things that can hurt us most. These days it's very popular to believe that this push for transparency  this kind of a combination between active citizens  new technologies and much more transparency friendly legislation can restore trust in politics. You believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this  it can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie  it's going to be more difficult for them to steal and probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill. This is probably true. But I do believe that we should be also very clear that now when we put the transparency at the center of politics where the message is   It's transparency  stupid.  Transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions. Transparency is politics' management of mistrust. We are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust. And by the way  mistrust was always very important for democracy. This is why you have checks and balances. This is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent. But when politics is only management of mistrust  then    I'm very glad that        has been mentioned    now we're going to have        in reverse. It's not going to be the Big Brother watching you  it's going to be we being the Big Brother watching the political class. But is this the idea of a free society  For example  can you imagine that decent  civic  talented people are going to run for office if they really do believe that politics is also about managing mistrust  Are you not afraid with all these technologies that are going to track down any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues  are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians to repeat their positions  even the very wrong positions  because consistency is going to be more important than common sense  And the Americans who are in the room  are you not afraid that your presidents are going to govern on the basis of what they said in the primary elections  I find this extremely important  because democracy is about people changing their views based on rational arguments and discussions. And we can lose this with the very noble idea to keep people accountable for showing the people that we're not going to tolerate politicians the opportunism in politics. So for me this is extremely important. And I do believe that when we're discussing politics these days  probably it makes sense to look also at this type of a story. But also don't forget  any unveiling is also veiling.  Regardless of  how transparent our governments want to be  they're going to be selectively transparent. In a small country that could be my country  but could be also your country  they took a decision    it is a real case story    that all of the governmental decisions  discussions of the council of ministers  were going to be published on the Internet    hours after the council discussions took place. And the public was extremely all for it. So I had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister  why he made this decision. He said   Listen  this is the best way to keep the mouths of my ministers closed. Because it's going to be very difficult for them to dissent knowing that    hours after this is going to be on the public space  and this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis.  So when we talk about transparency  when we talk about openness  I really do believe that what we should keep in mind is that what went right is what went wrong. And this is Goethe  who is neither Bulgarian nor a political scientist  some centuries ago he said   There is a big shadow where there is much light.  Thank you very much. ... pulling trees from the ground  shattering windows  taking the roofs off of homes ... Caitria O'Neill  That was me in front of our house in Monson  Massachusetts last June. After an EF  tornado ripped straight through our town and took parts of our roof off  I decided to stay in Massachusetts  instead of pursuing the master's program I had moved my boxes home that afternoon for. Morgan O'Neill  So  on June    we weren't disaster experts  but on June    we started faking it. This experience changed our lives  and now we're trying to change the experience. CO  So  tornadoes don't happen in Massachusetts  and I was cleverly standing in the front yard when one came over the hill. After a lamppost flew by  my family and I sprinted into the basement. Trees were thrown against the house  the windows exploded. When we finally got out the back door  transformers were burning in the street. MO  I was here in Boston. I'm a PhD student at MIT  and I happen to study atmospheric science. Actually  it gets weirder    I was in the museum of science at the time the tornado hit  playing with the tornado display    so I missed her call. I get a call from Caitria  hear the news  and start tracking the radar online to call the family back when another supercell was forming in their area. I drove home late that night with batteries and ice. We live across the street from a historic church that had lost its very iconic steeple in the storm. It had become a community gathering place overnight. The town hall and the police department had also suffered direct hits  and so people wanting to help or needing information went to the church. CO  We walked to the church because we heard they had hot meals  but when we arrived  we found problems. There were a couple large  sweaty men with chainsaws standing in the center of the church  but nobody knew where to send them because no one knew the extent of the damage yet. As we watched  they became frustrated and left to go find somebody to help on their own. MO  So we started organizing. Why  It had to be done. We found Pastor Bob and offered to give the response some infrastructure. And then  armed with just two laptops and one air card  we built a recovery machine. CO  That was a tornado  and everyone's heading to the church to drop things off and volunteer. MO  Everyone's donating clothing. We should inventory the donations piling up here. CO  And we need a hotline. Can you make a Google Voice number  MO  Sure. And we need to tell people what not to bring. I'll make a Facebook account. Can you print flyers  CO  Yeah  but we don't even know what houses are accepting help. We need to canvas and send out volunteers. MO  We need to tell people what not to bring. Hey  there's a news truck. I'll tell them. CO  You got my number off the news  We don't need more freezers  Together  Someone get me Post its  CO  And then the rest of the community figured out that we had answers. MO  I can donate three water heaters  but someone needs to come pick them up. CO  My car is in my living room  MO  My boyscout troop would like to rebuild    mailboxes. CO  My puppy is missing and insurance doesn't cover chimneys. MO  My church group of    would like housing and meals for a week while we repair properties. CO  You sent me to that place on Washington Street yesterday  and now I'm covered in poison ivy. So this is what filled our days. We had to learn how to answer questions quickly and to solve problems in a minute or less  otherwise  something more urgent would come up  and it wouldn't get done. MO  We didn't get our authority from the board of selectmen or the emergency management director or the United Way. We just started answering questions and making decisions because someone    anyone    had to. And why not me  I'm a campaign organizer. I'm good at Facebook. And there's two of me. CO  The point is  if there's a flood or a fire or a hurricane  you  or somebody like you  are going to step up and start organizing things. The other point is that it is hard. MO  Lying on the ground after another    hour day  Caitria and I would empty our pockets and try to place dozens of scraps of paper into context    all bits of information that had to be remembered and matched in order to help someone. After another day and a shower at the shelter  we realized it shouldn't be this hard. CO  In a country like ours where we breathe Wi Fi  leveraging technology for a faster recovery should be a no brainer. Systems like the ones that we were creating on the fly could exist ahead of time. And if some community member is in this organizing position in every area after every disaster  these tools should exist. MO  So  we decided to build them  a recovery in a box  something that could be deployed after every disaster by any local organizer. CO  I decided to stay in the country  give up the master's in Moscow and to work full time to make this happen. In the course of the past year  we've become experts in the field of community powered disaster recovery. And there are three main problems that we've observed with the way things work currently. MO  The tools. Large aid organizations are exceptional at bringing massive resources to bear after a disaster  but they often fulfill very specific missions  and then they leave. This leaves local residents to deal with the thousands of spontaneous volunteers  thousands of donations  and all with no training and no tools. So they use Post its or Excel or Facebook. But none of these tools allow you to value high priority information amidst all of the photos and well wishes. CO  The timing. Disaster relief is essentially a backwards political campaign. In a political campaign  you start with no interest and no capacity to turn that into action. You build both gradually  until a moment of peak mobilization at the time of the election. In a disaster  however  you start with all of the interest and none of the capacity. And you've only got about seven days to capture    percent of all of the Web searches that will ever be made to help your area. Then some sporting event happens  and you've got only the resources that you've collected thus far to meet the next five years of recovery needs. This is the slide for Katrina. This is the curve for Joplin. And this is the curve for the Dallas tornadoes in April  where we deployed software. There's a gap here. Affected households have to wait for the insurance adjuster to visit before they can start accepting help on their properties. And you've only got about four days of interest in Dallas. MO  Data. Data is inherently unsexy  but it can jump start an area's recovery. FEMA and the state will pay    percent of the cost of a federally declared disaster  leaving the town to pay the last    percent of the bill. Now that expense can be huge  but if the town can mobilize X amount of volunteers for Y hours  the dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town's contribution. But who knows that  Now try to imagine the sinking feeling you get when you've just sent out       volunteers and you can't prove it. CO  These are three problems with a common solution. If we can get the right tools at the right time to the people who will inevitably step up and start putting their communities back together  we can create new standards in disaster recovery. MO  We needed canvasing tools  donations databasing  needs reporting  remote volunteer access  all in an easy to use website. CO  And we needed help. Alvin  our software engineer and co founder  has built these tools. Chris and Bill have volunteered their time to use operations and partnerships. And we've been flying into disaster areas since this past January  setting up software  training residents and licensing the software to areas that are preparing for disasters. MO  One of our first launches was after the Dallas tornadoes this past April. We flew into a town that had a static  outdated website and a frenetic Facebook feed  trying to structure the response  and we launched our platform. All of the interest came in the first four days  but by the time they lost the news cycle  that's when the needs came in  yet they had this massive resource of what people were able to give and they've been able to meet the needs of their residents. CO  So it's working  but it could be better. Emergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery because it makes towns safer and more resilient. Imagine if we could have these systems ready to go in a place before a disaster. So that's what we're working on. We're working on getting the software to places so people expect it  so people know how to use it and so it can be filled ahead of time with that micro information that drives recovery. MO  It's not rocket science. These tools are obvious and people want them. In our hometown  we trained a half dozen residents to run these Web tools on their own  because Caitria and I live here  in Boston. They took to it immediately  and now they are forces of nature. There are over three volunteer groups working almost every day  and have been since June   of last year  to make sure these residents get what they need and get back in their homes. They have hotlines and spreadsheets and data. CO  And that makes a difference. June   this year marked the one year anniversary of the Monson tornado  and our community's never been more connected or more empowered. We've been able to see the same transformation in Texas and in Alabama. Because it doesn't take Harvard or MIT to fly in and fix problems after a disaster  it takes a local. No matter how good an aid organization is at what they do  they eventually have to go home. But if you give locals the tools  if you show them what they can do to recover  they become experts. MO  All right. Let's go. The story starts  I was at a friend's house  and she had on her shelf a copy of the DSM manual  which is the manual of mental disorders. It lists every known mental disorder. And it used to be  back in the '  s  a very slim pamphlet. And then it got bigger and bigger and bigger  and now it's     pages long. And it lists currently     mental disorders. So I was leafing through it  wondering if I had any mental disorders  and it turns out I've got   . I've got generalized anxiety disorder  which is a given. I've got nightmare disorder  which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure  and all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street going   You're a failure   I've got parent child relational problems  which I blame my parents for. I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. I'm kidding. And I've got malingering. And I think it's actually quite rare to have both malingering and generalized anxiety disorder  because malingering tends to make me feel very anxious. Anyway  I was looking through this book  wondering if I was much crazier than I thought I was  or maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you're not a trained professional  or maybe the psychiatry profession has a kind of strange desire to label what's essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder. I didn't know which of these was true  but I thought it was kind of interesting  and I thought maybe I should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view  which is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists. It was a man called Brian  who runs a crack team of Scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies. They're called the CCHR. And I said to him   Can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo science that can't be trusted   And he said   Yes  we can prove it to you.  And I said   How   And he said   We're going to introduce you to Tony.  And I said   Who's Tony   And he said   Tony's in Broadmoor.  Now  Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It used to be known as the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane. It's where they send the serial killers  and the people who can't help themselves. And I said to Brian   Well  what did Tony do   And he said   Hardly anything. He beat someone up or something  and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence. But he faked it too well  and now he's stuck in Broadmoor and nobody will believe he's sane. Do you want us to try and get you into Broadmoor to meet Tony   So I said   Yes  please.  So I got the train to Broadmoor. I began to yawn uncontrollably around Kempton Park  which apparently is what dogs also do when anxious  they yawn uncontrollably. And we got to Broadmoor. And I got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate into the wellness center  which is where you get to meet the patients. It looks like a giant Hampton Inn. It's all peach and pine and calming colors. And the only bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons. And the patients started drifting in. And they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants  and quite docile looking. And Brian the Scientologist whispered to me   They're medicated   which  to the Scientologists  is like the worst evil in the world  but I'm thinking it's probably a good idea. And then Brian said   Here's Tony.  And a man was walking in. And he wasn't overweight  he was in very good physical shape. And he wasn't wearing sweatpants  he was wearing a pinstripe suit. And he had his arm outstretched like someone out of The Apprentice. He looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was very sane. And he sat down. And I said   So is it true that you faked your way in here   And he said   Yep. Yep. Absolutely. I beat someone up when I was   . And I was in prison awaiting trial  and my cellmate said to me  'You know what you have to do  Fake madness. Tell them you're mad  you'll get sent to some cushy hospital. Nurses will bring you pizzas  you'll have your own PlayStation.'  I said   Well  how did you do it   He said   Well  I asked to see the prison psychiatrist. And I'd just seen a film called 'Crash ' in which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls. So I said to the psychiatrist  'I get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls.'  And I said   What else   He said   Oh  yeah. I told the psychiatrist that I wanted to watch women as they died  because it would make me feel more normal.  I said   Where'd you get that from   He said   Oh  from a biography of Ted Bundy that they had at the prison library.  Anyway  he faked madness too well  he said. And they didn't send him to some cushy hospital. They sent him to Broadmoor. And the minute he got there  said he took one look at the place  asked to see the psychiatrist  said   There's been a terrible misunderstanding. I'm not mentally ill.  I said   How long have you been here for   He said   Well  if I'd just done my time in prison for the original crime  I'd have got five years. I've been in Broadmoor for    years.  Tony said that it's a lot harder to convince people you're sane than it is to convince them you're crazy. He said   I thought the best way to seem normal would be to talk to people normally about normal things like football or what's on TV. I subscribe to New Scientist  and recently they had an article about how the U.S. Army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives. So I said to a nurse  'Did you know that the U.S. Army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives ' When I read my medical notes  I saw they'd written  'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.'  He said   You know  they're always looking out for nonverbal clues to my mental state. But how do you sit in a sane way  How do you cross your legs in a sane way  It's just impossible.  When Tony said that to me  I thought to myself   Am I sitting like a journalist  Am I crossing my legs like a journalist   He said   You know  I've got the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me  and I've got the 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' rapist on the other side of me. So I tend to stay in my room a lot because I find them quite frightening. And they take that as a sign of madness. They say it proves that I'm aloof and grandiose.  So  only in Broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness. Anyway  he seemed completely normal to me  but what did I know  And when I got home I emailed his clinician  Anthony Maden. I said   What's the story   And he said   Yep. We accept that Tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence  because his hallucinations    that had seemed quite cliche to begin with    just vanished the minute he got to Broadmoor. However  we have assessed him  and we've determined that what he is is a psychopath.  And in fact  faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath. It's on the checklist  cunning  manipulative. So  faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong. And I spoke to other experts  and they said the pinstripe suit    classic psychopath    speaks to items one and two on the checklist  glibness  superficial charm and grandiose sense of self worth. And I said   Well  but why didn't he hang out with the other patients   Classic psychopath    it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy. So all the things that had seemed most normal about Tony was evidence  according to his clinician  that he was mad in this new way. He was a psychopath. And his clinician said to me   If you want to know more about psychopaths  you can go on a psychopath spotting course run by Robert Hare  who invented the psychopath checklist.  So I did. I went on a psychopath spotting course  and I am now a certified    and I have to say  extremely adept    psychopath spotter. So  here's the statistics  One in a hundred regular people is a psychopath. So there's       people in his room. Fifteen of you are psychopaths. Although that figure rises to four percent of CEOs and business leaders  so I think there's a very good chance there's about    or    psychopaths in this room. It could be carnage by the end of the night. Hare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior    the lack of empathy  the glibness  cunning  manipulative. In fact  capitalism  perhaps at its most remorseless  is a physical manifestation of psychopathy. It's like a form of psychopathy that's come down to affect us all. Hare said   You know what  Forget about some guy at Broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness. Who cares  That's not a big story. The big story   he said   is corporate psychopathy. You want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths.  So I gave it a try. I wrote to the Enron people. I said   Could I come and interview you in prison  to find out it you're psychopaths   And they didn't reply. So I changed tack. I emailed  Chainsaw Al  Dunlap  the asset stripper from the     s. He would come into failing businesses and close down    percent of the workforce  just turn American towns into ghost towns. And I emailed him and I said   I believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you ... special  and interested in the predatory spirit  and fearless. Can I come and interview you about your special brain anomaly   And he said   Come on over   So I went to Al Dunlap's grand Florida mansion. It was filled with sculptures of predatory animals. There were lions and tigers    he was taking me through the garden    there were falcons and eagles  he was saying   Over there you've got sharks and     he was saying this in a less effeminate way     You've got more sharks and you've got tigers.  It was like Narnia. And then we went into his kitchen. Now  Al Dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies  he'd close down    percent of the workforce. And he'd quite often fire people with a joke. Like  for instance  one famous story about him  somebody came up to him and said   I've just bought myself a new car.  And he said   Well  you may have a new car  but I'll tell you what you don't have    a job.  So in his kitchen    he was in there with his wife  Judy  and his bodyguard  Sean    and I said   You know how I said in my email that you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special   He said   Yeah  it's an amazing theory  it's like Star Trek. You're going where no man has gone before.  And I said   Well      Clears throat  Some psychologists might say that this makes you      Mumbles  And he said   What   And I said   A psychopath.  And I said   I've got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket. Can I go through them with you   And he looked intrigued despite himself  and he said   Okay  go on.  And I said   Okay. Grandiose sense of self worth.  Which I have to say  would have been hard for him to deny  because he was standing under a giant oil painting of himself. He said   Well  you've got to believe in you   And I said   Manipulative.  He said   That's leadership.  And I said   Shallow affect  an inability to experience a range of emotions.  He said   Who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions   So he was going down the psychopath checklist  basically turning it into  Who Moved My Cheese   But I did notice something happening to me the day I was with Al Dunlap. Whenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal    like he said  no  to juvenile delinquency  he said he got accepted into West Point  and they don't let delinquents in West Point. He said  no  to many short term marital relationships. He's only ever been married twice. Admittedly  his first wife cited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like  but people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages in the heat of an argument  and his second marriage has lasted    years. So whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non psychopathic  I thought to myself  well I'm not going to put that in my book. And then I realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had kind of turned me a little bit psychopathic. Because I was desperate to shove him in a box marked  Psychopath.  I was desperate to define him by his maddest edges. And I realized  my God    this is what I've been doing for    years. It's what all journalists do. We travel across the world with our notepads in our hands  and we wait for the gems. And the gems are always the outermost aspects of our interviewee's personality. And we stitch them together like medieval monks  and we leave the normal stuff on the floor. And you know  this is a country that over diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely. Childhood bipolar    children as young as four are being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums  which scores them high on the bipolar checklist. When I got back to London  Tony phoned me. He said   Why haven't you been returning my calls   I said   Well  they say that you're a psychopath.  And he said   I'm not a psychopath.  He said   You know what  One of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse  but another item on the checklist is cunning  manipulative. So when you say you feel remorse for your crime  they say  'Typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels remorse when he doesn't.' It's like witchcraft  they turn everything upside down.  He said   I've got a tribunal coming up. Will you come to it   So I said okay. So I went to his tribunal. And after    years in Broadmoor  they let him go. They decided that he shouldn't be held indefinitely because he scores high on a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism. So they let him go. And outside in the corridor he said to me   You know what  Jon  Everyone's a bit psychopathic.  He said   You are  I am. Well  obviously I am.  I said   What are you going to do now   He said   I'm going to go to Belgium. There's a woman there that I fancy. But she's married  so I'm going to have to get her split up from her husband.  Anyway  that was two years ago  and that's where my book ended. And for the last    months  everything was fine. Nothing bad happened. He was living with a girl outside London. He was  according to Brian the Scientologist  making up for lost time  which I know sounds ominous  but isn't necessarily ominous. Unfortunately  after    months  he did go back to jail for a month. He got into a  fracas  in a bar  he called it. Ended up going to jail for a month  which I know is bad  but at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was  it wasn't too bad. And then he phoned me. And you know what  I think it's right that Tony is out. Because you shouldn't define people by their maddest edges. And what Tony is  is he's a semi psychopath. He's a gray area in a world that doesn't like gray areas. But the gray areas are where you find the complexity. It's where you find the humanity  and it's where you find the truth. And Tony said to me   Jon  could I buy you a drink in a bar  I just want to thank you for everything you've done for me.  And I didn't go. What would you have done  Thank you. I've got a great idea that's going to change the world. It's fantastic  it's going to blow your mind. It's my beautiful baby. Here's the thing  everybody loves a beautiful baby. I mean  I was a beautiful baby. Here's me and my dad a couple days after I was born. So in the world of product design  the beautiful baby's like the concept car. It's the knockout. You see it and you go   Oh  my God. I'd buy that in a second   So why is it that this year's new cars look pretty much exactly like last year's new cars  What went wrong between the design studio and the factory  Today  I don't want to talk about beautiful babies  I want to talk about the awkward adolescence of design    those sort of dorky teenage years where you're trying to figure out how the world works. I'm going to start with an example from some work that we did on newborn health. So here's a problem  four million babies around the world  mostly in developing countries  die every year before their first birthday  even before their first month of life. It turns out half of those kids  or about  .  million newborns around the world  would make it if you could just keep them warm for the first three days  maybe the first week. So this is a newborn intensive care unit in Kathmandu  Nepal. All of these kids in blankets belong in incubators    something like this. This is a donated Japanese Atom incubator that we found in a NICU in Kathmandu. This is what we want. Probably what happened is a hospital in Japan upgraded their equipment and donated their old stuff to Nepal. The problem is  without technicians  without spare parts  donations like this very quickly turn into junk. So this seemed like a problem that we could do something about. Keeping a baby warm for a week    that's not rocket science. So we got started. We partnered with a leading medical research institution here in Boston. We conducted months of user research overseas  trying to think like designers  human centered design     Let's figure out what people want.  We killed thousands of Post it notes. We made dozens of prototypes to get to this. So this is the NeoNurture infant incubator  and this has a lot of smarts built into it  and we felt great. So the idea here is  unlike the concept car  we want to marry something beautiful with something that actually works. And our idea is that this design would inspire manufacturers and other people of influence to take this model and run with it. Here's the bad news  the only baby ever actually put inside the NeoNurture incubator was this kid during a Time magazine photo shoot. So recognition is fantastic. We want design to get out for people to see it. It won lots of awards. But it felt like a booby prize. We wanted to make beautiful things that are going to make the world a better place  and I don't think this kid was even in it long enough to get warm. So it turns out that design  for inspiration doesn't really ... I guess what I would say is  for us  for what I want to do  it's either too slow or it just doesn't work  it's ineffective. So  really  I want to design for outcomes. I don't want to make beautiful stuff  I want to make the world a better place. So when we were designing NeoNurture  we paid a lot of attention to the people who are going to use this thing  for example  poor families  rural doctors  overloaded nurses  even repair technicians. We thought we had all our bases covered  we'd done everything right. Well  it turns out there's this whole constellation of people who have to be involved in a product for it to be successful  manufacturing  financing  distribution  regulation. Michael Free at PATH says you have to figure out who will  choose  use and pay the dues  for a product like this. And I have to ask the question that VCs always ask   Sir  what is your business  and who is your customer   Who is our customer  Well  here's an example. This is a Bangladeshi hospital director outside his facility. It turns out he doesn't buy any of his equipment. Those decisions are made by the Ministry of Health or by foreign donors  and it just kind of shows up. Similarly  here's a multinational medical device manufacturer. It turns out they've got to fish where the fish are. So it turns out that in emerging markets    where the fish are    are the emerging middle class of these countries    diseases of affluence  heart disease  infertility. So it turns out that design for outcomes in one aspect really means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution. OK  that was an important lesson. Second  we took that lesson and tried to push it into our next project. So we started by finding a manufacturer  an organization called MTTS in Vietnam  that manufactures newborn care technologies for Southeast Asia. Our other partner is East Meets West  an American foundation that distributes that technology to poor hospitals around that region. So we started with them  saying   Well  what do you want  What's a problem you want to solve   And they said   Let's work on newborn jaundice.  So this is another one of these mind boggling global problems. Jaundice affects two thirds of newborns around the world. Of those newborns  one in    roughly  if it's not treated  the jaundice gets so severe that it leads to either a life long disability  or the kids could even die. There's one way to treat jaundice  and that's what's called an exchange transfusion. So as you can imagine  that's expensive and a little bit dangerous. There is another cure. It's very technological  it's very complex  a little daunting. You've got to shine blue light on the kid. Bright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover. How is this a hard problem  I went to MIT. OK  we'll figure that out. So here's an example. This is an overhead phototherapy device that's designed for American hospitals  and here's how it's supposed to be used. It's over the baby  illuminating a single patient. Take it out of an American hospital  send it overseas to a crowded facility in Asia  here's how it's actually used. The effectiveness of phototherapy is a function of light intensity. These dark blue squares show you where it's effective phototherapy. Here's what it looks like under actual use. So those kids on the edges aren't actually receiving effective phototherapy. But without training  without some kind of light meter  how would you know  We see other examples of problems like this. Here's a neonatal intensive care unit  where moms come in to visit their babies. And keep in mind that Mom maybe just had a C section  so that's already kind of a bummer. Mom's visiting her kid. She sees her baby naked  lying under some blue lights  looking kind of vulnerable. It's not uncommon for Mom to put a blanket over the baby. From a phototherapy standpoint  maybe not the best behavior. In fact  that sounds kind of dumb. Except  what we've learned is that there's no such thing as a dumb user    there are only dumb products. We have to think like existentialists  it's not the painting we would have painted  it's the painting that we actually painted. It's the use    designed for actual use. How are people actually going to use this  So  similarly  when we think about our partner MTTS  they've made some amazing technologies for treating newborn illnesses. So here's an overhead warmer and a CPAP. They're inexpensive  really rugged. They've treated        kids in Vietnam with this technology. But here's the problem  Every doctor in the world  every hospital administrator  has seen TV    curse those  ER  reruns  Turns out they all know what a medical device is supposed to look like. They want Buck Rogers  they don't want effective. It sounds crazy  it sounds dumb  but there are actually hospitals who would rather have no equipment than something that looks cheap and crummy. So again  if we want people to trust a device  it has to look trustworthy. So thinking about outcomes  it turns out appearances matter. We took all that information together. We tried  this time  to get it right. And here's what we developed. This is the Firefly phototherapy device  except this time  we didn't stop at the concept car. From the very beginning  we started by talking to manufacturers. Our goal is to make a state of the art product that our partner MTTS can actually manufacture. Our goal is to study how they work  the resources they have access to  so that they can make this product. So that's the design for manufacture question. When we think about actual use  you'll notice that Firefly has a single bassinet. It only fits a single baby  and the idea here is it's obvious how you ought to use this device. If you try to put more than one kid in  you're stacking them on top of each other. So the idea here is you want to make it hard to use wrong. In other words  you want to make the right way to use it the easiest way to use it. Another example    again  silly Mom. Silly Mom thinks her baby looks cold  wants to put a blanket over the baby. That's why we have lights above and below the baby in Firefly  so if Mom does put a blanket over the baby  it's still receiving effective phototherapy from below. Last story here  I've got a friend in India who told me that you haven't really tested a piece of electronic technology for distribution in Asia  until you've trained a cockroach to climb in and pee on every single little component on the inside. You think it's funny. I had a laptop in the Peace Corps  and the screen had all these dead pixels on it. And one day I looked in    they were all dead ants that had gotten into my laptop and perished. Those poor ants. So with Firefly  what we did is    the problem is electronics get hot  and you have to put in vents or fans to keep them cool    in most products. We decided we can't put a  Do not enter  sign next to the vent. We actually got rid of all that stuff. So Firefly's totally sealed. These are the kinds of lessons    as awkward as it was to be a pretty goofy teenager  much worse to be a frustrated designer. So I was thinking   What I really want to do is change the world. I have to pay attention to manufacturing and distribution. I have to pay attention to how people are actually going to use a device. I actually have to pay attention. There's no excuse for failure. I have to think like an existentialist. I have to accept that there are no dumb users  only dumb products.  We have to ask ourselves hard questions. Are we designing for the world that we want  Are we designing for the world that we have  Are we designing for the world that's coming  whether we're ready or not  I got into this business designing products. I've since learned that if you really want to make a difference in the world  you have to design outcomes. And that's design that matters. Thank you. I worked on a film called  Apollo      and when I worked on this film  I discovered something about how our brains work  and how our brains work is that  when we're sort of infused with either enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever  it changes and alters our perception of things. It changes what we see. It changes what we remember. And as an experiment  because I dauntingly create a task for myself of recreating a Saturn V launch for this particular movie  because I put it out there  I felt a little nervous about it  so I need to do an experiment and bring a group of people like this in a projection room and play this stock footage  and when I played this stock footage  I simply wanted to find out what people remembered  what was memorable about it  What should I actually try to replicate  What should I try to emulate to some degree  So this is the footage that I was showing everybody. And what I discovered is  because of the nature of the footage and the fact that we're doing this film  there was an emotion that was built into it and our collective memories of what this launch meant to us and all these various things. When I showed it  and I asked  immediately after the screening was over  what they thought of it  what was your memorable shots  they changed them. They were    had camera moves on them. They had all kinds of things. Shots were combined  and I was just really curious  I mean  what the hell were you looking at just a few minutes ago and how come  how'd you come up with this sort of description  And what I discovered is  what I should do is not actually replicate what they saw  is replicate what they remembered. So this is our footage of the launch  based on  basically  taking notes  asking people what they thought  and then the combination of all the different shots and all the different things put together created their sort of collective consciousness of what they remembered it looked like  but not what it really looked like. So this is what we created for  Apollo   .  So literally what you're seeing now is the confluence of a bunch of different people  a bunch of different memories  including my own  of taking a little bit of liberty with the subject matter. I basically shot everything with short lenses  which means that you're very close to the action  but framed it very similarly to the long lens shots which gives you a sense of distance  so I was basically was setting up something that would remind you of something you haven't really quite seen before.  Music  And then I'm going to show you exactly what it is that you were reacting to when you were reacting to it. Tom Hanks  Hello  Houston  this is Odyssey. It's good to see you again.  Cheers   Music  Rob Legato  I pretend they're clapping for me. So now I'm in a parking lot. Basically it's a tin can  and I'm basically recreating the launch with fire extinguishers  fire  I have wax that I threw in front of the lens to look like ice  and so basically if you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you  what you were reacting to  what you're emoting to  is something that's a total falsehood  and I found that really kind of fascinating. And in this particular case  this is the climax of the movie  and  you know  the weight of achieving it was simply take a model  throw it out of a helicopter  and shoot it. And that's simply what I did. That's me shooting  and I'm a fairly mediocre operator  so I got that nice sense of verisimilitude  of a kind of  you know  following the rocket all the way down  and giving that little sort of edge  I was desperately trying to keep it in frame. So then I come up to the next thing. We had a NASA consultant who was actually an astronaut  who was actually on some of the missions  of Apollo     and he was there to basically double check my science. And  I guess somebody thought they needed to do that. I don't know why  but they thought they did. So we were  he's a hero  he's an astronaut  and we're all sort of excited  and  you know  I gave myself the liberty of saying  you know  some of the shots I did didn't really suck that bad. And so maybe  you know  we were feeling kind of a little good about it  so I brought him in here  and he needed to really check and see what we were doing  and basically give us our A plus report card  and so I showed him some shots we were working on  and waiting for the reaction that you hope for  which is what I got.  Music   Launch noises  So I showed him these two shots  and then he basically told me what he thought. Okay.  Laughter  It's what you dream about. So what I got from him is  he turned to me and said   You would never  ever design a rocket like that. You would never have a rocket go up while the gantry arms are going out. Can you imagine the tragedy that could possibly happen with that  You would never  ever design a rocket like that.  And he was looking at me. It's like  Yeah  I don't know if you noticed  but I'm the guy out in the parking lot recreating one of America's finest moments with fire extinguishers. And I'm not going to argue with you. You're an astronaut  a hero  and I'm from New Jersey  so    I'm just going to show you some footage. I'm just going to show you some footage  and tell me what you think. And then I did kind of get the reaction I was hoping for. So I showed him this  and this is actual footage that he was on. This is Apollo   . This was his mission. So I showed him this  and the reaction I got was interesting. So  and what happened was  I mean  what I sort of intuned in that is that he remembered it differently. He remembered that was a perfectly safe sort of gantry system  perfectly safe rocket launch  because he's sitting in a rocket that has  like  a hundred thousand pounds of thrust  built by the lowest bidder. He was hoping it was going to work out okay. So he twisted his memory around. Now  Ron Howard ran into Buzz Aldrin  who was not on the movie  so he had no idea that we were faking any of this footage  and he just responded as he would respond  and I'll run this. Ron Howard  Buzz Aldrin came up to me and said   Hey  that launch footage  I saw some shots I'd never seen before. Did you guys  what vault did you find that stuff in   And I said   Well  no vault  Buzz  we generated all that from scratch.  And he said   Huh  that's pretty good. Can we use it   RL  I think he's a great American. So   Titanic  was  if you don't know the story  doesn't end well. Jim Cameron actually photographed the real Titanic. So he basically set up  or basically shattered the suspension of disbelief  because what he photographed was the real thing  a Mir sub going down  or actually two Mir subs going down to the real wreck  and he created this very haunting footage. It's really beautiful  and it conjures up all these various different emotions  but he couldn't photograph everything  and to tell the story  I had to fill in the gaps  which is now rather daunting  because now I have to recreate back to back what really happened and I had  I'm the only one who could really blow it at that point. So this is the footage he photographed  and it was pretty moving and pretty awe inspiring. So I'm going to just let it run  so you kind of absorb this sort of thing  and I'll describe my sort of reactions when I was looking at it for the very first time. I got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically see it come back to life. I automatically wanted to see this ship  this magnificent ship  basically in all its glory  and conversely  I wanted to see it not in all its glory  basically go back to what it looks like. So I conjured up an effect that I'm later going to show you what I tried to do  which is kind of the heart of the movie  for me  and so that's why I wanted to do the movie  that's why I wanted to create the sort of things I created. And I'll show you  you know  another thing that I found interesting is what we really were emoting to when you take a look at it. So here's the behind the scenes  a couple of little shots here. So  when you saw my footage  you were seeing this  basically  a bunch of guys flipping a ship upside down  and the little Mir subs are actually about the size of small footballs  and shot in smoke. Jim went three miles went down  and I went about three miles away from the studio and photographed this in a garage. And so  but what you're emoting to  or what you're looking at  had the same feeling  the same haunting quality  that Jim's footage had  so I found it so fascinating that our brains sort of  once you believe something's real  you transfer everything that you feel about it  this quality you have  and it's totally artificial. It's totally make believe  yet it's not to you  and I found that that was a very interesting thing to explore and use  and it caused me to create the next effect that I'll show you  which is this sort of magic transition  and all I was really attempting to do is basically have the audience cue the effect  so it became a seamless experience for them  that I wasn't showing you my sort of interpretation  I was showing you what you wanted to see. And the very next shot  right after this    So you can see what I was doing. So basically  if there's two subs in the same shot  I shot it  because where's the camera coming from  And when Jim shot it  it was only one sub  because he was photographing from the other  and I don't remember if I did this or Jim did this. I'll give it to Jim  because he could use the pat on the back. Okay. So now the Titanic transition. So this is what I was referring to where I wanted to basically magically transplant from one state of the Titanic to the other. So I'll just play the shot once.  Music  And what I was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you. Gloria Stuart  That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight. RL  So  what I did is basically I had another screening room experience where I was basically tracking where I was looking  or where we were looking  and of course you're looking at the two people on the bow of the ship  and then at some point  I'm changing the periphery of the shot  I'm changing  it's becoming the rusted wreck  and then I would run it every day  and then I would find exactly the moment that I stopped looking at them and start noticing the rest of it  and the moment my eye shifted  we just marked it to the frame. The moment my eye shifted  I immediately started to change them  so now somehow you missed where it started and where it stopped. And so I'll just show it one more time. naturally do for us  which is  as soon as you shift your attention  something changes  and then I left the little scarf going  because it really wanted to be a ghostly shot  really wanted to feel like they were still on the wreck  essentially. That's where they were buried forever. Or something like that. I just made that up. It was  incidentally  the last time I ever saw daylight. It was a long film to work on.  Laughter  Now   Hugo  was another interesting movie  because the movie itself is about film illusions. It's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence of vision that creates a motion picture  and one of the things I had to do is  we   Sasha Baron Cohen is a very clever  very smart guy  comedian  wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of the Buster Keaton sort of slapstick things  and he wanted his leg brace to get caught on a moving train. Very dangerous  very impossible to do  and particularly on our stage  because there literally is no way to actually move this train  because it fits so snugly into our set. So let me show you the scene  and then I basically used the trick that was identified by Sergei Eisenstein  which is  if you have a camera that's moving with a moving object  what is not moving appears to be moving  and what is moving appears to be stopped  so what you're actually seeing now is the train is not moving at all  and what is actually moving is the floor. So this is the shot. That's a little video of what you're looking at there  which is our little test  so that's actually what you're seeing  and I thought it was sort of an interesting thing  because it was  part of the homage of the movie itself is coming up with this sort of genius trick which I can't take credit for. I'd love to but I can't  because it was invented like in      or something like that  is I told Marty  and it's kind of one of those mind things that it's really hard to really get until you actually see it work  and I said  you know  what I was going to do  and he said   So  let me see if I can get this straight. The thing with the wheels  That doesn't move.   And the thing without the wheels  that moves.  Precisely.  Laughter  Brings me to the next  and final    Marty's not going to see this  is he   Laughter  This isn't viewed outside of     Laughter  The next illustration is something that  there's like all one shot theory. It's a very elegant way of telling a story  especially if you're following somebody on a journey  and that journey basically tells something about their personality in a very concise way  and what we wanted to do based on the shot in  Goodfellas   which is one of the great shots ever  a Martin Scorsese film  of basically following Henry Hill through what it feels like to be a gangster walk going through the Copacabana and being treated in a special way. He was the master of his universe  and we wanted Hugo to feel the same way  so we created this shot. That's Hugo.  Music  And we felt that if we could basically move the camera with him  we would feel what it feels like to be this boy who is basically the master of his universe  and his universe is  you know  behind the scenes in the bowels of this particular train station that only he can actually navigate through and do it this way  and we had to make it feel that this is his normal  everyday sort of life  so the idea of doing it as one shot was very important  and of course  in shooting in  D  which is basically it's a huge camera that's hanging off of a giant stick  so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task  and make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got when you saw the  Goodfellas  shot. So what you're now going to see is how we actually did it. It's actually five separate sets shot at five different times with two different boys. The one on the left is where the shot ends  and the shot on the right is where it takes over  and now we switch boys  so it went from Asa Butterfield  who's the star of the show  to his stand in.  Music  I wouldn't say his stunt double. There's a crazy rig that we built for this.  Music  And so this is  and now this is set number three we're into  and then we're going to go into  basically the very last moment of the shot is actually the steadycam shot. Everything else was shot on cranes and various things like that  and it literally was done over five different sets  two different boys  different times  and it all had to feel like it was all one shot  and what was sort of great for me was it was probably the best reviewed shot I've ever worked on  and  you know  I was kind of proud of it when I was done  which is  you should never really be proud of stuff  I guess. So I was kind of proud of it  and I went to a friend of mine  and said   You know  this is  you know  kind of the best reviewed shot I've ever worked on. What do you think was the reason   And he said   Because no one knows you had anything to do with it.  So  all I can say is  thank you  and that's my presentation for you.  Applause  In System D  this is a store  and what I mean by that is that this is a photograph I took in Makoko  shantytown in Lagos  Nigeria. It's built over the lagoon  and there are no streets where there can be stores to shop  and so the store comes to you. And in the same community  this is business synergy. This is the boat that that lady was paddling around in  and this artisan makes the boat and the paddles and sells directly to the people who need the boat and the paddles. And this is a global business. Ogandiro smokes fish in Makoko in Lagos  and I asked her   Where does the fish come from   And I thought she'd say   Oh  you know  up the lagoon somewhere  or maybe across Africa   but you'll be happy to know she said it came from here  it comes from the North Sea. It's caught here  frozen  shipped down to Lagos  smoked  and sold for a tiny increment of profit on the streets of Lagos. And this is a business incubator. This is Olusosun dump  the largest garbage dump in Lagos  and       people work here  and I found this out from this fellow  Andrew Saboru. Andrew spent    years scavenging materials on the dump  earned enough money to turn himself into a contract scaler  which meant he carried a scale and went around and weighed all the materials that people had scavenged from the dump. Now he's a scrap dealer. That's his little depot behind him  and he earns twice the Nigerian minimum wage. This is a shopping mall. This is Oshodi Market in Lagos. Jorge Luis Borges had a story called  The Aleph   and the Aleph is a point in the world where absolutely everything exists  and for me  this image is a point in the world where absolutely everything exists. So  what am I talking about when I talk about System D  It's traditionally called the informal economy  the underground economy  the black market. I don't conceive of it that way. I think it's really important to understand that something like this is totally open. It's right there for you to find. All of this is happening openly  and aboveboard. There's nothing underground about it. It's our prejudgment that it's underground. I've pirated the term System D from the former French colonies. There's a word in French that is d brouillardise  that means to be self reliant  and the former French colonies have turned that into System D for the economy of self reliance  or the DIY economy. But governments hate the DIY economy  and that's why    I took this picture in       and this is the same market in         and I think  when the organizers of this conference were talking about radical openness  they didn't mean that the streets should be open and the people should be gone. I think what we have is a pickle problem. I had a friend who worked at a pickle factory  and the cucumbers would come flying down this conveyer belt  and his job was to pick off the ones that didn't look so good and throw them in the bin labeled  relish  where they'd be crushed and mixed with vinegar and used for other kinds of profit. This is the pickle economy. We're all focusing on   this is a statistic from earlier this month in the Financial Times   we're all focusing on the luxury economy. It's worth  .  trillion dollars every year  and that's a vast amount of money  right  That's three times the Gross Domestic Product of Switzerland. So it's vast. But it should come with an asterisk  and the asterisk is that it excludes two thirds of the workers of the world.  .  billion people around the world work in the economy that is unregulated and informal. That's a huge number  and what does that mean  Well  it means if it were united in a single political system  one country  call it  The United Street Sellers Republic   the U.S.S.R.  or  Bazaaristan   it would be worth    trillion dollars every year  and that would make it the second largest economy in the world  after the United States. And given that projections are that the bulk of economic growth over the next    years will come from emerging economies in the developing world  it could easily overtake the United States and become the largest economy in the world. So the implications of that are vast  because it means that this is where employment is    .  billion people   and this is where we can create a more egalitarian world  because people are actually able to earn money and live and thrive  as Andrew Saboru did. Big businesses have recognized this  and what's fascinating about this slide  it's not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads and run around without dropping them off. it's that the Gala sausage roll is a product that's made by a global company called UAC foods that's active throughout Africa and the Middle East  but the Gala sausage roll is not sold in stores. UAC foods has recognized that it won't sell if it's in stores. It's only sold by a phalanx of street hawkers who run around the streets of Lagos at bus stations and in traffic jams and sell it as a snack  and it's been sold that way for    years. It's a business plan for a corporation. And it's not just in Africa. Here's Mr. Clean looking amorously at all the other Procter   Gamble products  and Procter   Gamble  you know  the statistic always cited is that Wal Mart is their largest customer  and it's true  as one store  Wal Mart buys    percent  thus    percent of Procter   Gamble's business is with Wal Mart  but their largest market segment is something that they call  high frequency stores   which is all these tiny kiosks and the lady in the canoe and all these other businesses that exist in System D  the informal economy  and Procter   Gamble makes    percent of its money from that market segment  and it's the only market segment that's growing. So Procter   Gamble says   We don't care whether a store is incorporated or registered or anything like that. We want our products in that store.  And then there's mobile phones. This is an ad for MTN  which is a South African multinational active in about    countries  and when they came into Nigeria   Nigeria is the big dog in Africa. One in seven Africans is a Nigerian  and so everyone wants in to the mobile phone market in Nigeria. And when MTN came in  they wanted to sell the mobile service like I get in the United States or like people get here in the U.K. or in Europe    expensive monthly plans  you get a phone  you pay overages  you're killed with fees    and their plan crashed and burned. And they went back to the drawing board  and they retooled  and they came up with another plan  We don't sell you the phone  we don't sell you the monthly plan. We only sell you airtime. And where's the airtime sold  It's sold at umbrella stands all over the streets  where people are unregistered  unlicensed  but MTN makes most of its profits  perhaps    percent of its profits  from selling through System D  the informal economy. And where do the phones come from  Well  they come from here. This is in Guangzhou  China  and if you go upstairs in this rather sleepy looking electronics mall  you find the Guangzhou Dashatou second hand trade center  and if you go in there  you follow the guys with the muscles who are carrying the boxes  and where are they going  They're going to Eddy in Lagos. Now  most of the phones there are not second hand at all. The name is a misnomer. Most of them are pirated. They have the name brand on them  but they're not manufactured by the name brand. Now  are there downsides to that  Well  I guess. You know  China has no   Versace without the vowels. Zhuomani instead of Armani. S. Guuuci  and     Laughter   Applause  All around the world this is how products are being distributed  so  for instance  in one street market on Rua    de Mar o in S o Paulo  Brazil  you can buy fake designer glasses. You can buy cloned cologne. You can buy pirated DVDs  of course. You can buy New York Yankees caps in all sorts of unauthorized patterns. You can buy cuecas baratas  designer underwear that isn't really manufactured by a designer  and even pirated evangelical mixtapes.  Laughter  Now  businesses tend to complain about this  and their  they  I don't want to take away from their entire validity of complaining about it  but I did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year what they thought about piracy  and they told me   Well  you can't quote me on this  because if you quote me on this  I have to kill you   but they use piracy as market research. The sneaker manufacturer told me that if they find that Pumas are being pirated  or Adidas are being pirated and their sneakers aren't being pirated  they know they've done something wrong.  Laughter  So it's very important to them to track piracy exactly because of this  and the people who are buying  the pirates  are not their customers anyway  because their customers want the real deal. Now  there's another problem. This is a real street sign in Lagos  Nigeria. All of System D really doesn't pay taxes  right  And when I think about that  first of all I think that government is a social contract between the people and the government  and if the government isn't transparent  then the people aren't going to be transparent either  but also that we're blaming the little guy who doesn't pay his taxes  and we're not recognizing that everyone's fudging things all over the world  including some extremely respected businesses  and I'll give you one example. There was one company that paid       bribes in the first decade of this millennium  and a million dollars in bribes every business day  right  All over the world. And that company was the big German electronics giant Siemens. So this goes on in the formal economy as well as the informal economy  so it's wrong of us to blame   and I'm not singling out Siemens  I'm saying everyone does it. Okay  I just want to end by saying that if Adam Smith had framed out a theory of the flea market instead of the free market  what would be some of the principles  First  it would be to understand that it could be considered a cooperative  and this is a thought from the Brazilian legal scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger. Cooperative development is a way forward. Secondly  from the  Austrian  anarchist philosopher Paul Feyerabend  facts are relative  and what is a massive right of self reliance to a Nigerian businessperson is considered unauthorized and horrible to other people  and we have to recognize that there are differences in how people define things and what their facts are. And third is  and I'm taking this from the great American beat poet Allen Ginsberg  that alternate economies barter and different kinds of currency  alternate currencies are also very important  and he talked about buying what he needed just with his good looks. And so I just want to leave you there  and say that this economy is a tremendous force for global development and we need to think about it that way. Thank you very much.  Applause  I'd like to tell you about two games of chess. The first happened in       in which Garry Kasparov  a human  lost to Deep Blue  a machine. To many  this was the dawn of a new era  one where man would be dominated by machine. But here we are     years on  and the greatest change in how we relate to computers is the iPad  not HAL. The second game was a freestyle chess tournament in       in which man and machine could enter together as partners  rather than adversaries  if they so chose. At first  the results were predictable. Even a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster with a relatively weak laptop. The surprise came at the end. Who won  Not a grandmaster with a supercomputer  but actually two American amateurs using three relatively weak laptops. Their ability to coach and manipulate their computers to deeply explore specific positions effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge of the grandmasters and the superior computational power of other adversaries. This is an astonishing result  average men  average machines beating the best man  the best machine. And anyways  isn't it supposed to be man versus machine  Instead  it's about cooperation  and the right type of cooperation. We've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky's vision for artificial intelligence over the last    years. It's a sexy vision  for sure. Many have embraced it. It's become the dominant school of thought in computer science. But as we enter the era of big data  of network systems  of open platforms  and embedded technology  I'd like to suggest it's time to reevaluate an alternative vision that was actually developed around the same time. I'm talking about J.C.R. Licklider's human computer symbiosis  perhaps better termed  intelligence augmentation   I.A. Licklider was a computer science titan who had a profound effect on the development of technology and the Internet. His vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate in making decisions  controlling complex situations without the inflexible dependence on predetermined programs. Note that word  cooperate.  Licklider encourages us not to take a toaster and make it Data from  Star Trek   but to take a human and make her more capable. Humans are so amazing    how we think  our non linear approaches  our creativity  iterative hypotheses  all very difficult if possible at all for computers to do. Licklider intuitively realized this  contemplating humans setting the goals  formulating the hypotheses  determining the criteria  and performing the evaluation. Of course  in other ways  humans are so limited. We're terrible at scale  computation and volume. We require high end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing. Licklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making. Silently  without much fanfare  this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess. Protein folding  a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess   there are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe. This is a world changing problem with huge implications for our ability to understand and treat disease. And for this task  supercomputer field brute force simply isn't enough. Foldit  a game created by computer scientists  illustrates the value of the approach. Non technical  non biologist amateurs play a video game in which they visually rearrange the structure of the protein  allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces and interactions and identify structural issues. This approach beat supercomputers    percent of the time and tied    percent of the time. Foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deciphering the structure of the Mason Pfizer monkey virus. A protease that had eluded determination for over    years was solved was by three players in a matter of days  perhaps the first major scientific advance to come from playing a video game. Last year  on the site of the Twin Towers  the      memorial opened. It displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called  meaningful adjacency.  It places the names next to each other based on their relationships to one another  friends  families  coworkers. When you put it all together  it's quite a computational challenge        victims        adjacency requests  the importance of the overall physical specifications and the final aesthetics. When first reported by the media  full credit for such a feat was given to an algorithm from the New York City design firm Local Projects. The truth is a bit more nuanced. While an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework  humans used that framework to design the final result. So in this case  a computer had evaluated millions of possible layouts  managed a complex relational system  and kept track of a very large set of measurements and variables  allowing the humans to focus on design and compositional choices. So the more you look around you  the more you see Licklider's vision everywhere. Whether it's augmented reality in your iPhone or GPS in your car  human computer symbiosis is making us more capable. So if you want to improve human computer symbiosis  what can you do  You can start by designing the human into the process. Instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem  design the solution around what the human will do as well. When you do this  you'll quickly realize that you spent all of your time on the interface between man and machine  specifically on designing away the friction in the interaction. In fact  this friction is more important than the power of the man or the power of the machine in determining overall capability. That's why two amateurs with a few laptops handily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster. What Kasparov calls process is a byproduct of friction. The better the process  the less the friction. And minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable. Or take another example  big data. Every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever growing array of sensors  your phone  your credit card  your computer. The result is big data  and it actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition. The major emphasis of most approaches to big data focus on   How do I store this data  How do I search this data  How do I process this data   These are necessary but insufficient questions. The imperative is not to figure out how to compute  but what to compute. How do you impose human intuition on data at this scale  Again  we start by designing the human into the process. When PayPal was first starting as a business  their biggest challenge was not   How do I send money back and forth online   It was   How do I do that without being defrauded by organized crime   Why so challenging  Because while computers can learn to detect and identify fraud based on patterns  they can't learn to do that based on patterns they've never seen before  and organized crime has a lot in common with this audience  brilliant people  relentlessly resourceful  entrepreneurial spirit    Laughter    and one huge and important difference  purpose. And so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest fraudsters  catching the cleverest is the difference between success and failure. There's a whole class of problems like this  ones with adaptive adversaries. They rarely if ever present with a repeatable pattern that's discernable to computers. Instead  there's some inherent component of innovation or disruption  and increasingly these problems are buried in big data. For example  terrorism. Terrorists are always adapting in minor and major ways to new circumstances  and despite what you might see on TV  these adaptations  and the detection of them  are fundamentally human. Computers don't detect novel patterns and new behaviors  but humans do. Humans  using technology  testing hypotheses  searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them. Osama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence. He was caught by dedicated  resourceful  brilliant people in partnerships with various technologies. As appealing as it might sound  you cannot algorithmically data mine your way to the answer. There is no  Find Terrorist  button  and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems  the less effective data mining can be. Instead  people will have to look at data and search for insight  and as Licklider foresaw long ago  the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation  and as Kasparov realized  that means minimizing friction at the interface. Now this approach makes possible things like combing through all available data from very different sources  identifying key relationships and putting them in one place  something that's been nearly impossible to do before. To some  this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties implications. To others it foretells of an era of greater privacy and civil liberties protections  but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance. That must be acknowledged  and they can't be swept aside  even with the best of intents. So let's explore  through a couple of examples  the impact that technologies built to drive human computer symbiosis have had in recent time. In October        U.S. and coalition forces raided an al Qaeda safe house in the city of Sinjar on the Syrian border of Iraq. They found a treasure trove of documents      biographical sketches of foreign fighters. These foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf  the Levant and North Africa to join al Qaeda in Iraq. These records were human resource forms. The foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization. It turns out that al Qaeda  too  is not without its bureaucracy.  Laughter  They answered questions like   Who recruited you    What's your hometown    What occupation do you seek   In that last question  a surprising insight was revealed. The vast majority of foreign fighters were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom    hugely important  since between      and       Iraq had       suicide bombings  a major source of instability. Analyzing this data was hard. The originals were sheets of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated. The friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational time frame using humans  PDFs and tenacity alone. The researchers had to lever up their human minds with technology to dive deeper  to explore non obvious hypotheses  and in fact  insights emerged. Twenty percent of the foreign fighters were from Libya     percent of those from a single town in Libya  hugely important since prior statistics put that figure at three percent. It also helped to hone in on a figure of rising importance in al Qaeda  Abu Yahya al Libi  a senior cleric in the Libyan Islamic fighting group. In March of       he gave a speech  after which there was a surge in participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters. Perhaps most clever of all  though  and least obvious  by flipping the data on its head  the researchers were able to deeply explore the coordination networks in Syria that were ultimately responsible for receiving and transporting the foreign fighters to the border. These were networks of mercenaries  not ideologues  who were in the coordination business for profit. For example  they charged Saudi foreign fighters substantially more than Libyans  money that would have otherwise gone to al Qaeda. Perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network if they knew they cheating would be jihadists. In January        a devastating  .  earthquake struck Haiti  third deadliest earthquake of all time  left one million people     percent of the population  homeless. One seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water started rolling. January and February are the dry months in Haiti  yet many of the camps had developed standing water. The only institution with detailed knowledge of Haiti's floodplains had been leveled in the earthquake  leadership inside. So the question is  which camps are at risk  how many people are in these camps  what's the timeline for flooding  and given very limited resources and infrastructure  how do we prioritize the relocation  The data was incredibly disparate. The U.S. Army had detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country. There was data online from a      environmental risk conference  other geospatial data  none of it integrated. The human goal here was to identify camps for relocation based on priority need. The computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospacial information  social media data and relief organization information to answer this question. By implementing a superior process  what was otherwise a task for    people over three months became a simple job for three people in    hours  all victories for human computer symbiosis. We're more than    years into Licklider's vision for the future  and the data suggests that we should be quite excited about tackling this century's hardest problems  man and machine in cooperation together. Thank you.  Applause  I'm going to tell you about why I became a sculptor  and you may think that sculptors  well  they deal with meta  they deal with objects  they deal with bodies  but I think  really  what I care about most is making space  and that's what I've called this talk  Making Space. Space that exists within us  and without us. So  when I was a child  I don't know how many of you grew up in the '  s  but I was sent upstairs for an enforced rest.  Laughter  It's a really bad idea. I mean  after lunch  you're  you know  you're six  and you want to go and climb a tree. But I had to go upstairs  this tiny little room that was actually made out of an old balcony  so it was incredibly hot  small and light  and I had to lie there. It was ridiculous. But anyway  for some reason  I promised myself that I wasn't going to move  that I was going to do this thing that Mummy wanted me to do. And there I was  lying there in this tiny space  hot  dark  claustrophobic  matchbox sized  behind my eyes  but it was really weird  like  after this went on for days  weeks  months  that space would get bigger and darker and cooler until I really looked forward to that half an hour of enforced immobility and rest  and I really looked forward to going to that place of darkness. Do you mind if we do something completely different  Can we all just close our eyes for a minute  Now  this isn't going to be freaky. It isn't some cultic thing.  Laughter  It's just  it's just  I just would like us all to go there. So I'm going to do it too. We'll all be there together. So close your eyes for a minute. Here we are  in a space  the subjective  collective space of the darkness of the body. I think of this as the place of imagination  of potential  but what are its qualities  It is objectless. There are no things in it. It is dimensionless. It is limitless. It is endless. Okay  open your eyes. That's the space that I think sculpture    which is a bit of a paradox  sculpture that is about making material propositions    but I think that's the space that sculpture can connect us with. So  imagine we're in the middle of America. You're asleep. You wake up  and without lifting your head from the earth on your sleeping bag  you can see for    miles. This is a dry lake bed. I was young. I'd just finished art school. I wanted to do something that was working directly with the world  directly with place. This was a wonderful place  because it was a place where you could imagine that you were the first person to be there. It was a place where nothing very much had happened. Anyway  bear with me. I picked up a hand sized stone  threw it as far as I was able  it was about    meters. I then cleared all the stones within that radius and made a pile. And that was the pile  by the way. And then  I stood on the pile  and threw all of those rocks out again  and here is rearranged desert. You could say  well  it doesn't look very different from when he started. What's all the fuss about  In fact  Chris was worried and said   Look  don't show them that slide  because they're just going to think you're another one of those crazy modern artists who doesn't do much. But the fact is  this is evidence of a living body on other bodies  rocks that have been the subject of geological formation  erosion  the action of time on objects. This is a place  in a way  that I just would like you to  in a way  look at differently because of this event that has happened in it  a human event  and in general  it just asks us to look again at this world  so different from  in a way  the world that we have been sharing with each other  the technological world  to look again at the elemental world. The elemental world that we all live in is that space that we all visited together  the darkness of the body. I wanted to start again with that environment  the environment of the intimate  subjective space that each of us lives in  but from the other side of appearance. So here is a daily activity of the studio. You can see I don't do much. I'm just standing there  again with my eyes closed  and other people are molding me  evidential. This is an indexical register of a lived moment of a body in time. Can we map that space  using the language of neutrinos or cosmic rays  taking the bounding condition of the body as its limit  but in complete reversal of  in a way  the most traditional Greek idea of pointing  In the old days they used to take a lump of Pentelic marble and drill from the surface in order to identify the skin  the appearance  what Aristotle defined as the distinction between substance and appearance  the thing that makes things visible  but here we're working from the other side. Or can we do it as an exclusive membrane  This is a lead case made around the space that my body occupied  but it's now void. This is a work called  Learning To See.  It's a bit of  well  we could call it night  we could call it the    percent of gravity that we don't know about  dark matter  placed in space  anyway  another version of a human space in space at large  but I don't know if you can see  the eyes are indicated  they're closed. It's called  Learning To See  because it's about an object that hopefully works reflexively and talks about that vision or connection with the darkness of the body that I see as a space of potential. Can we do it another way  using the language of particles around a nucleus  and talk about the body as an energy center  No longer about statues  no longer having to take that duty of standing  the standing of a human body  or the standing of a statue  release it  allow it to be an energy field  a space in space that talks about human life  between becoming an entropy as a sort of concentration of attention  a human place of possibility in space at large. Is there another way  Dark matter now placed against a horizon. If minds live in bodies  if bodies live in clothes  and then in rooms  and then in buildings  and then in cities  do they also have a final skin  and is that skin perceptual  The horizon. And is art about trying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon  Can we use  in a way  a body as an empty catalyst for a kind of empathy with the experience of space time as it is lived  as I am standing here in front of you trying to feel and make a connection in this space time that we are sharing  can we use  at it were  the memory of a body  of a human space in space to catalyze an experience  again  firsthand experience  of elemental time. Human time  industrial time  tested against the time of the tides  in which these memories of a particular body  that could be any body  multiplied as in the time of mechanical reproduction  many times  placed over three square miles  a mile out to sea  disappearing  in different conditions of day and night. You can see this work. It's on the mouth of the Mersey  just outside Liverpool. And there you can see what a Liverpool sea looks like on a typical afternoon. The pieces appear and disappear  but maybe more importantly    this is just looking north from the center of the installation    they create a field  a field that involves living and the surrogate bodies in a kind of relation  a relation with each other and a relation with that limit  the edge  the horizon. Just moving on  is it possible  taking that idea of mind  body  body building  to supplant the first body  the biological body  with the second  the body of architecture and the built environment. This is a work called  Room for the Great Australian Desert.  It's in an undefined location and I've never published where it is. It's an object for the mind. I think of it as a   st century Buddha. Again  the darkness of the body  now held within this bunker shape of the minimum position that a body needs to occupy  a crouching body. There's a hole at the anus  penis level. There are holes at ears. There are no holes at the eyes. There's a slot for the mouth. It's two and a half inches thick  concrete with a void interior. Again  a site found with a completely flat     degree horizon. This is just simply asking  again  as if we had arrived for the first time  what is the relationship of the human project to time and space  Taking that idiom of  as it were  the darkness of the body transferred to architecture  can you use architectural space not for living but as a metaphor  and use its systolic  diastolic smaller and larger spaces to provide a kind of firsthand somatic narrative for a journey through space  light and darkness  This is a work of some proportion and some weight that makes the body into a city  an aggregation of cells that are all interconnected and that allow certain visual access at certain places. The last work that I just wanted to share with you is  Blind Light   which is perhaps the most open work  and in a conference of radical openness  I think maybe this is as radical as I get  using light and water vapor as my materials. Here is a box filled at one and a half atmospheres of atmospheric pressure  with a cloud and with very bright light. As you walk towards the ever open threshold  you disappear  both to yourselves and to others. If you hold your hand out in front of you  you can't see it. If you look down  you can't see your feet. You are now consciousness without an object  freed from the dimensionful and measured way in which life links us to the obligatory. But this is a space that is actually filled with people  disembodied voices  and out of that ambient environment  when people come close to your own body zone  very close  they appear to you as representations. When they appear close to the edge  they are representations  representations in which the viewers have become the viewed. For me  art is not about objects of high monetary exchange. It's about reasserting our firsthand experience in present time. As John Cage said   We are not moving towards some kind of goal. We are at the goal  and it is changing with us. If art has any purpose  it is to open our eyes to that fact.  Thank you very much. Some years ago  I set out to try to understand if there was a possibility to develop biofuels on a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels but not compete with agriculture for water  fertilizer or land. So here's what I came up with. Imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it just underwater  and we fill it with wastewater and some form of microalgae that produces oil  and we make it out of some kind of flexible material that moves with waves underwater  and the system that we're going to build  of course  will use solar energy to grow the algae  and they use CO   which is good  and they produce oxygen as they grow. The algae that grow are in a container that distributes the heat to the surrounding water  and you can harvest them and make biofuels and cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed  and of course you'd have to make a large area of this  so you'd have to worry about other stakeholders like fishermen and ships and such things  but hey  we're talking about biofuels  and we know the importance of potentially getting an alternative liquid fuel. Why are we talking about microalgae  Here you see a graph showing you the different types of crops that are being considered for making biofuels  so you can see some things like soybean  which makes    gallons per acre per year  or sunflower or canola or jatropha or palm  and that tall graph there shows what microalgae can contribute. That is to say  microalgae contributes between       and       gallons per acre per year  compared to the    gallons per acre per year from soy. So what are microalgae  Microalgae are micro    that is  they're extremely small  as you can see here a picture of those single celled organisms compared to a human hair. Those small organisms have been around for millions of years and there's thousands of different species of microalgae in the world  some of which are the fastest growing plants on the planet  and produce  as I just showed you  lots and lots of oil. Now  why do we want to do this offshore  Well  the reason we're doing this offshore is because if you look at our coastal cities  there isn't a choice  because we're going to use waste water  as I suggested  and if you look at where most of the waste water treatment plants are  they're embedded in the cities. This is the city of San Francisco  which has     miles of sewer pipes under the city already  and it releases its waste water offshore. So different cities around the world treat their waste water differently. Some cities process it. Some cities just release the water. But in all cases  the water that's released is perfectly adequate for growing microalgae. So let's envision what the system might look like. We call it OMEGA  which is an acronym for Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae. At NASA  you have to have good acronyms. So how does it work  I sort of showed you how it works already. We put waste water and some source of CO  into our floating structure  and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow  and they sequester CO  that would otherwise go off into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas. They of course use solar energy to grow  and the wave energy on the surface provides energy for mixing the algae  and the temperature is controlled by the surrounding water temperature. The algae that grow produce oxygen  as I've mentioned  and they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food and other bi algal products of interest. And the system is contained. What do I mean by that  It's modular. Let's say something happens that's totally unexpected to one of the modules. It leaks. It's struck by lightning. The waste water that leaks out is water that already now goes into that coastal environment  and the algae that leak out are biodegradable  and because they're living in waste water  they're fresh water algae  which means they can't live in salt water  so they die. The plastic we'll build it out of is some kind of well known plastic that we have good experience with  and we'll rebuild our modules to be able to reuse them again. So we may be able to go beyond that when thinking about this system that I'm showing you  and that is to say we need to think in terms of the water  the fresh water  which is also going to be an issue in the future  and we're working on methods now for recovering the waste water. The other thing to consider is the structure itself. It provides a surface for things in the ocean  and this surface  which is covered by seaweeds and other organisms in the ocean  will become enhanced marine habitat so it increases biodiversity. And finally  because it's an offshore structure  we can think in terms of how it might contribute to an aquaculture activity offshore. So you're probably thinking   Gee  this sounds like a good idea. What can we do to try to see if it's real   Well  I set up laboratories in Santa Cruz at the California Fish and Game facility  and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks to test some of these ideas. We also set up experiments in San Francisco at one of the three waste water treatment plants  again a facility to test ideas. And finally  we wanted to see where we could look at what the impact of this structure would be in the marine environment  and we set up a field site at a place called Moss Landing Marine Lab in Monterey Bay  where we worked in a harbor to see what impact this would have on marine organisms. The laboratory that we set up in Santa Cruz was our skunkworks. It was a place where we were growing algae and welding plastic and building tools and making a lot of mistakes  or  as Edison said  we were finding the        ways that the system wouldn't work. Now  we grew algae in waste water  and we built tools that allowed us to get into the lives of algae so that we could monitor the way they grow  what makes them happy  how do we make sure that we're going to have a culture that will survive and thrive. So the most important feature that we needed to develop were these so called photobioreactors  or PBRs. These were the structures that would be floating at the surface made out of some inexpensive plastic material that'll allow the algae to grow  and we had built lots and lots of designs  most of which were horrible failures  and when we finally got to a design that worked  at about    gallons  we scaled it up to     gallons in San Francisco. So let me show you how the system works. We basically take waste water with algae of our choice in it  and we circulate it through this floating structure  this tubular  flexible plastic structure  and it circulates through this thing  and there's sunlight of course  it's at the surface  and the algae grow on the nutrients. But this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag. The algae are not going to suffocate because of CO   as we would. They suffocate because they produce oxygen  and they don't really suffocate  but the oxygen that they produce is problematic  and they use up all the CO . So the next thing we had to figure out was how we could remove the oxygen  which we did by building this column which circulated some of the water  and put back CO   which we did by bubbling the system before we recirculated the water. And what you see here is the prototype  which was the first attempt at building this type of column. The larger column that we then installed in San Francisco in the installed system. So the column actually had another very nice feature  and that is the algae settle in the column  and this allowed us to accumulate the algal biomass in a context where we could easily harvest it. So we would remove the algaes that concentrated in the bottom of this column  and then we could harvest that by a procedure where you float the algae to the surface and can skim it off with a net. So we wanted to also investigate what would be the impact of this system in the marine environment  and I mentioned we set up this experiment at a field site in Moss Landing Marine Lab. Well  we found of course that this material became overgrown with algae  and we needed then to develop a cleaning procedure  and we also looked at how seabirds and marine mammals interacted  and in fact you see here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting  and would periodically work its way across this little floating water bed  and we wanted to hire this guy or train him to be able to clean the surface of these things  but that's for the future. Now really what we were doing  we were working in four areas. Our research covered the biology of the system  which included studying the way algae grew  but also what eats the algae  and what kills the algae. We did engineering to understand what we would need to be able to do to build this structure  not only on the small scale  but how we would build it on this enormous scale that will ultimately be required. I mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals and looked at basically the environmental impact of the system  and finally we looked at the economics  and what I mean by economics is  what is the energy required to run the system  Do you get more energy out of the system than you have to put into the system to be able to make the system run  And what about operating costs  And what about capital costs  And what about  just  the whole economic structure  So let me tell you that it's not going to be easy  and there's lots more work to do in all four of those areas to be able to really make the system work. But we don't have a lot of time  and I'd like to show you the artist's conception of how this system might look if we find ourselves in a protected bay somewhere in the world  and we have in the background in this image  the waste water treatment plant and a source of flue gas for the CO   but when you do the economics of this system  you find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work. Unless you look at the system as a way to treat waste water  sequester carbon  and potentially for photovoltaic panels or wave energy or even wind energy  and if you start thinking in terms of integrating all of these different activities  you could also include in such a facility aquaculture. So we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculture where we're growing mussels or scallops. We'd be growing oysters and things that would be producing high value products and food  and this would be a market driver as we build the system to larger and larger scales so that it becomes  ultimately  competitive with the idea of doing it for fuels. So there's always a big question that comes up  because plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputation right now  and so we've been thinking cradle to cradle. What are we going to do with all this plastic that we're going to need to use in our marine environment  Well  I don't know if you know about this  but in California  there's a huge amount of plastic that's used in fields right now as plastic mulch  and this is plastic that's making these tiny little greenhouses right along the surface of the soil  and this provides warming the soil to increase the growing season  it allows us to control weeds  and  of course  it makes the watering much more efficient. So the OMEGA system will be part of this type of an outcome  and that when we're finished using it in the marine environment  we'll be using it  hopefully  on fields. Where are we going to put this  and what will it look like offshore  Here's an image of what we could do in San Francisco Bay. San Francisco produces    million gallons a day of waste water. If we imagine a five day retention time for this system  we'd need     million gallons to accomodate  and that would be about       acres of these OMEGA modules floating in San Francisco Bay. Well  that's less than one percent of the surface area of the bay. It would produce  at       gallons per acre per year  it would produce over   million gallons of fuel  which is about    percent of the biodiesel  or of the diesel that would be required in San Francisco  and that's without doing anything about efficiency. Where else could we potentially put this system  There's lots of possibilities. There's  of course  San Francisco Bay  as I mentioned. San Diego Bay is another example  Mobile Bay or Chesapeake Bay  but the reality is  as sea level rises  there's going to be lots and lots of new opportunities to consider.  Laughter  So what I'm telling you about is a system of integrated activities. Biofuels production is integrated with alternative energy is integrated with aquaculture. I set out to find a pathway to innovative production of sustainable biofuels  and en route I discovered that what's really required for sustainability is integration more than innovation. Long term  I have great faith in our collective and connected ingenuity. I think there is almost no limit to what we can accomplish if we are radically open and we don't care who gets the credit. Sustainable solutions for our future problems are going to be diverse and are going to be many. I think we need to consider everything  everything from alpha to OMEGA. Thank you.  Applause  Chris Anderson  Just a quick question for you  Jonathan. Can this project continue to move forward within NASA or do you need some very ambitious green energy fund to come and take it by the throat  Jonathan Trent  So it's really gotten to a stage now in NASA where they would like to spin it out into something which would go offshore  and there are a lot of issues with doing it in the United States because of limited permitting issues and the time required to get permits to do things offshore. It really requires  at this point  people on the outside  and we're being radically open with this technology in which we're going to launch it out there for anybody and everybody who's interested to take it on and try to make it real. CA  So that's interesting. You're not patenting it. You're publishing it. JT  Absolutely. CA  All right. Thank you so much. JT  Thank you.  Applause  I thought I would start with a very brief history of cities. Settlements typically began with people clustered around a well  and the size of that settlement was roughly the distance you could walk with a pot of water on your head. In fact  if you fly over Germany  for example  and you look down and you see these hundreds of little villages  they're all about a mile apart. You needed easy access to the fields. And for hundreds  even thousands of years  the home was really the center of life. Life was very small for most people. It was a center of entertainment  of energy production  of work  a center of health care. That's where babies were born and people died. Then  with industrialization  everything started to become centralized. You had dirty factories that were moved to the outskirts of cities. Production was centralized in assembly plants. You had centralized energy production. Learning took place in schools. Health care took place in hospitals. And then you had networks that developed. You had water  sewer networks that allowed for this kind of unchecked expansion. You had separated functions  increasingly. You had rail networks that connected residential  industrial  commercial areas. You had auto networks. In fact  the model was really  give everybody a car  build roads to everything  and give people a place to park when they get there. It was not a very functional model. And we still live in that world  and this is what we end up with. So you have the sprawl of LA  the sprawl of Mexico City. You have these unbelievable new cities in China  which you might call tower sprawl. They're all building cities on the model that we invented in the '  s and '  s  which is really obsolete  I would argue  and there are hundreds and hundreds of new cities that are being planned all over the world. In China alone      million people  some say     million people  will move to the city over the next    years. That means building the equivalent of the entire built infrastructure of the US in    years. Imagine that. And we should all care about this whether you live in cities or not. Cities will account for    percent of the population growth     percent of the global CO      percent of energy use  but at the same time it's where people want to be  increasingly. More than half the people now in the world live in cities  and that will just continue to escalate. Cities are places of celebration  personal expression. You have the flash mobs of pillow fights that    I've been to a couple. They're quite fun. You have    Cities are where most of the wealth is created  and particularly in the developing world  it's where women find opportunities. That's a lot of the reason why cities are growing very quickly. Now there's some trends that will impact cities. First of all  work is becoming distributed and mobile. The office building is basically obsolete for doing private work. The home  once again  because of distributed computation    Communication is becoming a center of life  so it's a center of production and learning and shopping and health care and all of these things that we used to think of as taking place outside of the home. And increasingly  everything that people buy  every consumer product  in one way or another  can be personalized. And that's a very important trend to think about. So this is my image of the city of the future. In that it's a place for people  you know. Maybe not the way people dress  but    You know  the question now is  how can we have all the good things that we identify with cities without all the bad things  This is Bangalore. It took me a couple of hours to get a few miles in Bangalore last year. So with cities  you also have congestion and pollution and disease and all these negative things. How can we have the good stuff without the bad  So we went back and started looking at the great cities that evolved before the cars. Paris was a series of these little villages that came together  and you still see that structure today. The    arrondissements of Paris are these little neighborhoods. Most of what people need in life can be within a five  or    minute walk. And if you look at the data  when you have that kind of a structure  you get a very even distribution of the shops and the physicians and the pharmacies and the cafes in Paris. And then you look at cities that evolved after the automobile  and it's not that kind of a pattern. There's very little that's within a five minute walk of most areas of places like Pittsburgh. Not to pick on Pittsburgh  but most American cities really have evolved this way. So we said  well  let's look at new cities  and we're involved in a couple of new city projects in China. So we said  let's start with that neighborhood cell. We think of it as a compact urban cell. So provide most of what most people want within that    minute walk. This can also be a resilient electrical microgrid  community heating  power  communication networks  etc. can be concentrated there. Stewart Brand would put a micronuclear reactor right in the center  probably. And he might be right. And then we can form  in effect  a mesh network. It's something of an Internet typology pattern  so you can have a series of these neighborhoods. You can dial up the density    about        people per cell  if it's Cambridge. Go up to        if it's Manhattan density. You connect everything with mass transit and you provide most of what most people need within that neighborhood. You can begin to develop a whole typology of streetscapes and the vehicles that can go on them. I won't go through all of them. I'll just show one. This is Boulder. It's a great example of kind of a mobility parkway  a superhighway for joggers and bicyclists  where you can go from one end of the city to the other without crossing the street  and they also have bike sharing  which I'll get into in a minute. This is even a more interesting solution in Seoul  Korea. They took the elevated highway  they got rid of it  they reclaimed the street  the river down below  below the street  and you can go from one end of Seoul to the other without crossing a pathway for cars. The High Line in Manhattan is very similar. You have these rapidly emerging bike lanes all over the world. I lived in Manhattan for    years. I went back a couple of weekends ago  took this photograph of these fabulous new bike lanes that they have installed. They're still not to where Copenhagen is  where something like    percent of the trips within the city are by bicycle. It's mostly just because they have fantastic infrastructure there. We actually did exactly the wrong thing in Boston. The Big Dig    So we got rid of the highway but we created a traffic island  and it's certainly not a mobility pathway for anything other than cars. Mobility on demand is something we've been thinking about  so we think we need an ecosystem of these shared use vehicles connected to mass transit. These are some of the vehicles that we've been working on. But shared use is really key. If you share a vehicle  you can have at least four people use one vehicle  as opposed to one. We have Hubway here in Boston  the V lib' system in Paris. We've been developing  at the Media Lab  this little city car that is optimized for shared use in cities. We got rid of all the useless things like engines and transmissions. We moved everything to the wheels  so you have the drive motor  the steering motor  the breaking    all in the wheel. That left the chassis unencumbered  so you can do things like fold  so you can fold this little vehicle up to occupy a tiny little footprint. This was a video that was on European television last week showing the Spanish Minister of Industry driving this little vehicle  and when it's folded  it can spin. You don't need reverse. You don't need parallel parking. You just spin and go directly in. So we've been working with a company to commercialize this. My PhD student Ryan Chin presented these early ideas two years ago at a TEDx conference. So what's interesting is  then if you begin to add new things to it  like autonomy  you get out of the car  you park at your destination  you pat it on the butt  it goes and it parks itself  it charges itself  and you can get something like seven times as many vehicles in a given area as conventional cars  and we think this is the future. Actually  we could do this today. It's not really a problem. We can combine shared use and folding and autonomy and we get something like    times the land utilization with that kind of strategy. One of our graduate students then says  well  how does a driverless car communicate with pedestrians  You have nobody to make eye contact with. You don't know if it's going to run you over. So he's developing strategies so the vehicle can communicate with pedestrians  so    So the headlights are eyeballs  the pupils can dilate  we have directional audio  we can throw sound directly at people. What I love about this project is he solved a problem that doesn't exist yet  so    We also think that we can democratize access to bike lanes. You know  bike lanes are mostly used by young guys in stretchy pants. So    We think we can develop a vehicle that operates on bike lanes  accessible to elderly and disabled  women in skirts  businesspeople  and address the issues of energy congestion  mobility  aging and obesity simultaneously. That's our challenge. This is an early design for this little three wheel. It's an electronic bike. You have to pedal to operate it in a bike lane  but if you're an older person  that's a switch. If you're a healthy person  you might have to work really hard to go fast. You can dial in    calories going into work and     going home  when you can take a shower. We hope to have that built this fall. Housing is another area where we can really improve. Mayor Menino in Boston says lack of affordable housing for young people is one of the biggest problems the city faces. Developers say  OK  we'll build little teeny apartments. People say  we don't really want to live in a little teeny conventional apartment. So we're saying  let's build a standardized chassis  much like our car. Let's bring advanced technology into the apartment  technology enabled infill  give people the tools within this open loft chassis to go through a process of defining what their needs and values and activities are  and then a matching algorithm will match a unique assembly of integrated infill components  furniture  and cabinetry  that are personalized to that individual  and they give them the tools to go through the process and to refine it  and it's something like working with an architect  where the dialogue starts when you give an alternative to a person to react to. Now  the most interesting implementation of that for us is when you can begin to have robotic walls  so your space can convert from exercise to a workplace  if you run a virtual company. You have guests over  you have two guest rooms that are developed. You have a conventional one bedroom arrangement when you need it. Maybe that's most of the time. You have a dinner party. The table folds out to fit    people in otherwise a conventional one bedroom  or maybe you want a dance studio. I mean  architects have been thinking about these ideas for a long time. What we need to do now  develop things that can scale to those     million Chinese people that would like to live in the city  and very comfortably. We think we can make a very small apartment that functions as if it's twice as big by utilizing these strategies. I don't believe in smart homes. That's sort of a bogus concept. I think you have to build dumb homes and put smart stuff in it. And so we've been working on a chassis of the wall itself. You know  standardized platform with the motors and the battery when it operates  little solenoids that will lock it in place and get low voltage power. We think this can all be standardized  and then people can personalize the stuff that goes into that wall  and like the car  we can integrate all kinds of sensing to be aware of human activity  so if there's a baby or a puppy in the way  you won't have a problem. So the developers say  well  this is great. OK  so if we have a conventional building  we have a fixed envelope  maybe we can put in    units. If they function as if they're twice as big  we can get    units in. That means twice as much parking  though. Parking's really expensive. It's about        dollars per space to build a conventional parking spot inside a building. So if you can have folding and autonomy  you can do that in one seventh of the space. That goes down to        dollars per car  just for the cost of the parking. You add shared use  and you can even go further. We can also integrate all kinds of advanced technology through this process. There's a path to market for innovative companies to bring technology into the home. In this case  a project we're doing with Siemens. We have sensors on all the furniture  all the infill  that understands where people are and what they're doing. Blue light is very efficient  so we have these tunable    bit LED lighting fixtures. It recognizes where the person is  what they're doing  fills out the light when necessary to full spectrum white light  and saves maybe        percent in energy consumption  we think  over even conventional state of the art lighting systems. This just shows you the data that comes from the sensors that are embedded in the furniture. We don't really believe in cameras to do things in homes. We think these little wireless sensors are more effective. We think we can also personalize sunlight. That's sort of the ultimate personalization in some ways. So we've looked at articulating mirrors of the facade that can throw shafts of sunlight anywhere into the space  therefore allowing you to shade most of the glass on a hot day like today. In this case  she picks up her phone  she can map food preparation at the kitchen island to a particular location of sunlight. An algorithm will keep it in that location as long as she's engaged in that activity. This can be combined with LED lighting as well. We think workplaces should be shared. I mean  this is really the workplace of the future  I think. This is Starbucks  you know. Maybe a third    And you see everybody has their back to the wall and they have food and coffee down the way and they're in their own little personal bubble. We need shared spaces for interaction and collaboration. We're not doing a very good job with that. At the Cambridge Innovation Center  you can have shared desks. I've spent a lot of time in Finland at the design factory of Aalto University  where the they have a shared shop and shared fab lab  shared quiet spaces  electronics spaces  recreation places. We think ultimately  all of this stuff can come together  a new model for mobility  a new model for housing  a new model for how we live and work  a path to market for advanced technologies. But in the end  the main thing we need to focus on are people. Cities are all about people. They're places for people. There's no reason why we can't dramatically improve the livability and creativity of cities like they've done in Melbourne with the laneways while at the same time dramatically reducing CO  and energy. It's a global imperative. We have to get this right. Thank you. The murder happened a little over    years ago  January the   th        in a small bedroom community of Lynwood  California  just a few miles southeast of Los Angeles. A father came out of his house to tell his teenage son and his five friends that it was time for them to stop horsing around on the front lawn and on the sidewalk  to get home  finish their schoolwork  and prepare themselves for bed. And as the father was administering these instructions  a car drove by  slowly  and just after it passed the father and the teenagers  a hand went out from the front passenger window  and     Bam  Bam      killing the father. And the car sped off. The police  investigating officers  were amazingly efficient. They considered all the usual culprits  and in less than    hours  they had selected their suspect  Francisco Carrillo  a    year old kid who lived about two or three blocks away from where the shooting occurred. They found photos of him. They prepared a photo array  and the day after the shooting  they showed it to one of the teenagers  and he said   That's the picture. That's the shooter I saw that killed the father.  That was all a preliminary hearing judge had to listen to  to bind Mr. Carrillo over to stand trial for a first degree murder. In the investigation that followed before the actual trial  each of the other five teenagers was shown photographs  the same photo array. The picture that we best can determine was probably the one that they were shown in the photo array is in your bottom left hand corner of these mug shots. The reason we're not sure absolutely is because of the nature of evidence preservation in our judicial system  but that's another whole TEDx talk for later.  Laughter  So at the actual trial  all six of the teenagers testified  and indicated the identifications they had made in the photo array. He was convicted. He was sentenced to life imprisonment  and transported to Folsom Prison. So what's wrong  Straightforward  fair trial  full investigation. Oh yes  no gun was ever found. No vehicle was ever identified as being the one in which the shooter had extended his arm  and no person was ever charged with being the driver of the shooter's vehicle. And Mr. Carrillo's alibi  Which of those parents here in the room might not lie concerning the whereabouts of your son or daughter in an investigation of a killing  Sent to prison  adamantly insisting on his innocence  which he has consistently for    years. So what's the problem  The problems  actually  for this kind of case come manyfold from decades of scientific research involving human memory. First of all  we have all the statistical analyses from the Innocence Project work  where we know that we have  what           documented cases now where people have been wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated  some from death row  on the basis of later DNA analysis  and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases of exoneration involved only eyewitness identification testimony during the trial that convicted them. We know that eyewitness identifications are fallible. The other comes from an interesting aspect of human memory that's related to various brain functions but I can sum up for the sake of brevity here in a simple line  The brain abhors a vacuum. Under the best of observation conditions  the absolute best  we only detect  encode and store in our brains bits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us  and they're stored in different parts of the brain. So now  when it's important for us to be able to recall what it was that we experienced  we have an incomplete  we have a partial store  and what happens  Below awareness  with no requirement for any kind of motivated processing  the brain fills in information that was not there  not originally stored  from inference  from speculation  from sources of information that came to you  as the observer  after the observation. But it happens without awareness such that you don't  aren't even cognizant of it occurring. It's called reconstructed memories. It happens to us in all the aspects of our life  all the time. It was those two considerations  among others    reconstructed memory  the fact about the eyewitness fallibility    that was part of the instigation for a group of appeal attorneys led by an amazing lawyer named Ellen Eggers to pool their experience and their talents together and petition a superior court for a retrial for Francisco Carrillo. They retained me  as a forensic neurophysiologist  because I had expertise in eyewitness memory identification  which obviously makes sense for this case  right  But also because I have expertise and testify about the nature of human night vision. Well  what's that got to do with this  Well  when you read through the case materials in this Carrillo case  one of the things that suddenly strikes you is that the investigating officers said the lighting was good at the crime scene  at the shooting. All the teenagers testified during the trial that they could see very well. But this occurred in mid January  in the Northern Hemisphere  at   p.m. at night. So when I did the calculations for the lunar data and the solar data at that location on Earth at the time of the incident of the shooting  all right  it was well past the end of civil twilight and there was no moon up that night. So all the light in this area from the sun and the moon is what you see on the screen right here. The only lighting in that area had to come from artificial sources  and that's where I go out and I do the actual reconstruction of the scene with photometers  with various measures of illumination and various other measures of color perception  along with special cameras and high speed film  right  Take all the measurements and record them  right  And then take photographs  and this is what the scene looked like at the time of the shooting from the position of the teenagers looking at the car going by and shooting. This is looking directly across the street from where they were standing. Remember  the investigating officers' report said the lighting was good. The teenagers said they could see very well. This is looking down to the east  where the shooting vehicle sped off  and this is the lighting directly behind the father and the teenagers. As you can see  it is at best poor. No one's going to call this well lit  good lighting  and in fact  as nice as these pictures are  and the reason we take them is I knew I was going to have to testify in court  and a picture is worth more than a thousand words when you're trying to communicate numbers  abstract concepts like lux  the international measurement of illumination  the Ishihara color perception test values. When you present those to people who are not well versed in those aspects of science and that  they become salamanders in the noonday sun. It's like talking about the tangent of the visual angle  all right  Their eyes just glaze over  all right  A good forensic expert also has to be a good educator  a good communicator  and that's part of the reason why we take the pictures  to show not only where the light sources are  and what we call the spill  the distribution  but also so that it's easier for the trier of fact to understand the circumstances. So these are some of the pictures that  in fact  I used when I testified  but more importantly were  to me as a scientist  are those readings  the photometer readings  which I can then convert into actual predictions of the visual capability of the human eye under those circumstances  and from my readings that I recorded at the scene under the same solar and lunar conditions at the same time  so on and so forth  right  I could predict that there would be no reliable color perception  which is crucial for face recognition  and that there would be only scotopic vision  which means there would be very little resolution  what we call boundary or edge detection  and that furthermore  because the eyes would have been totally dilated under this light  the depth of field  the distance at which you can focus and see details  would have been less than    inches away. I testified to that to the court  and while the judge was very attentive  it had been a very  very long hearing for this petition for a retrial  and as a result  I noticed out of the corner of my eye that I thought that maybe the judge was going to need a little more of a nudge than just more numbers. And here I became a bit audacious  and I turned and I asked the judge  I said   Your Honor  I think you should go out and look at the scene yourself.  Now I may have used a tone which was more like a dare than a request    Laughter    but nonetheless  it's to this man's credit and his courage that he said   Yes  I will.  A shocker in American jurisprudence. So in fact  we found the same identical conditions  we reconstructed the entire thing again  he came out with an entire brigade of sheriff's officers to protect him in this community  all right   Laughter  We had him stand actually slightly in the street  so closer to the suspect vehicle  the shooter vehicle  than the actual teenagers were  so he stood a few feet from the curb toward the middle of the street. We had a car that came by  same identical car as described by the teenagers  right  It had a driver and a passenger  and after the car had passed the judge by  the passenger extended his hand  pointed it back to the judge as the car continued on  just as the teenagers had described it  right  Now  he didn't use a real gun in his hand  so he had a black object in his hand that was similar to the gun that was described. He pointed by  and this is what the judge saw. This is the car    feet away from the judge. There's an arm sticking out of the passenger side and pointed back at you. That's    feet away. Some of the teenagers said that in fact the car was    feet away when it shot. Okay. There's    feet. At this point  I became a little concerned. This judge is someone you'd never want to play poker with. He was totally stoic. I couldn't see a twitch of his eyebrow. I couldn't see the slightest bend of his head. I had no sense of how he was reacting to this  and after he looked at this reenactment  he turned to me and he says   Is there anything else you want me to look at   I said   Your honor   and I don't know whether I was emboldened by the scientific measurements that I had in my pocket and my knowledge that they are accurate  or whether it was just sheer stupidity  which is what the defense lawyers thought    Laughter    when they heard me say   Yes  Your Honor  I want you stand right there and I want the car to go around the block again and I want it to come and I want it to stop right in front of you  three to four feet away  and I want the passenger to extend his hand with a black object and point it right at you  and you can look at it as long as you want.  And that's what he saw.  Laughter  You'll notice  which was also in my test report  all the dominant lighting is coming from the north side  which means that the shooter's face would have been photo occluded. It would have been backlit. Furthermore  the roof of the car is causing what we call a shadow cloud inside the car which is making it darker. And this is three to four feet away. Why did I take the risk  I knew that the depth of field was    inches or less. Three to four feet  it might as well have been a football field away. This is what he saw. He went back  there was a few more days of evidence that was heard. At the end of it  he made the judgment that he was going to grant the petition for a retrial. And furthermore  he released Mr. Carrillo so that he could aid in the preparation of his own defense if the prosecution decided to retry him. Which they decided not to. He is now a freed man.  Applause  This is him embracing his grandmother in law. He    His girlfriend was pregnant when he went to trial  right  And she had a little baby boy. He and his son are both attending Cal State  Long Beach right now taking classes.  Applause  And what does this example    what's important to keep in mind for ourselves  First of all  there's a long history of antipathy between science and the law in American jurisprudence. I could regale you with horror stories of ignorance over decades of experience as a forensic expert of just trying to get science into the courtroom. The opposing council always fight it and oppose it. One suggestion is that all of us become much more attuned to the necessity  through policy  through procedures  to get more science in the courtroom  and I think one large step toward that is more requirements  with all due respect to the law schools  of science  technology  engineering  mathematics for anyone going into the law  because they become the judges. Think about how we select our judges in this country. It's very different than most other cultures. All right  The other one that I want to suggest  the caution that all of us have to have  I constantly have to remind myself  about just how accurate are the memories that we know are true  that we believe in  There is decades of research  examples and examples of cases like this  where individuals really  really believe. None of those teenagers who identified him thought that they were picking the wrong person. None of them thought they couldn't see the person's face. We all have to be very careful. All our memories are reconstructed memories. They are the product of what we originally experienced and everything that's happened afterwards. They're dynamic. They're malleable. They're volatile  and as a result  we all need to remember to be cautious  that the accuracy of our memories is not measured in how vivid they are nor how certain you are that they're correct. Thank you.  Applause  I want you to imagine this for a moment. Two men  Rahul and Rajiv  living in the same neighborhood  from the same educational background  similar occupation  and they both turn up at their local accident emergency complaining of acute chest pain. Rahul is offered a cardiac procedure  but Rajiv is sent home. What might explain the difference in the experience of these two nearly identical men  Rajiv suffers from a mental illness. The difference in the quality of medical care received by people with mental illness is one of the reasons why they live shorter lives than people without mental illness. Even in the best resourced countries in the world  this life expectancy gap is as much as    years. In the developing countries of the world  this gap is even larger. But of course  mental illnesses can kill in more direct ways as well. The most obvious example is suicide. It might surprise some of you here  as it did me  when I discovered that suicide is at the top of the list of the leading causes of death in young people in all countries in the world  including the poorest countries of the world. But beyond the impact of a health condition on life expectancy  we're also concerned about the quality of life lived. Now  in order for us to examine the overall impact of a health condition both on life expectancy as well as on the quality of life lived  we need to use a metric called the DALY  which stands for a Disability Adjusted Life Year. Now when we do that  we discover some startling things about mental illness from a global perspective. We discover that  for example  mental illnesses are amongst the leading causes of disability around the world. Depression  for example  is the third leading cause of disability  alongside conditions such as diarrhea and pneumonia in children. When you put all the mental illnesses together  they account for roughly    percent of the total global burden of disease. Indeed  mental illnesses are also very damaging to people's lives  but beyond just the burden of disease  let us consider the absolute numbers. The World Health Organization estimates that there are nearly four to five hundred million people living on our tiny planet who are affected by a mental illness. Now some of you here look a bit astonished by that number  but consider for a moment the incredible diversity of mental illnesses  from autism and intellectual disability in childhood  through to depression and anxiety  substance misuse and psychosis in adulthood  all the way through to dementia in old age  and I'm pretty sure that each and every one us present here today can think of at least one person  at least one person  who's affected by mental illness in our most intimate social networks. I see some nodding heads there. But beyond the staggering numbers  what's truly important from a global health point of view  what's truly worrying from a global health point of view  is that the vast majority of these affected individuals do not receive the care that we know can transform their lives  and remember  we do have robust evidence that a range of interventions  medicines  psychological interventions  and social interventions  can make a vast difference. And yet  even in the best resourced countries  for example here in Europe  roughly    percent of affected people don't receive these interventions. In the sorts of countries I work in  that so called treatment gap approaches an astonishing    percent. It isn't surprising  then  that if you should speak to anyone affected by a mental illness  the chances are that you will hear stories of hidden suffering  shame and discrimination in nearly every sector of their lives. But perhaps most heartbreaking of all are the stories of the abuse of even the most basic human rights  such as the young woman shown in this image here that are played out every day  sadly  even in the very institutions that were built to care for people with mental illnesses  the mental hospitals. It's this injustice that has really driven my mission to try to do a little bit to transform the lives of people affected by mental illness  and a particularly critical action that I focused on is to bridge the gulf between the knowledge we have that can transform lives  the knowledge of effective treatments  and how we actually use that knowledge in the everyday world. And an especially important challenge that I've had to face is the great shortage of mental health professionals  such as psychiatrists and psychologists  particularly in the developing world. Now I trained in medicine in India  and after that I chose psychiatry as my specialty  much to the dismay of my mother and all my family members who kind of thought neurosurgery would be a more respectable option for their brilliant son. Any case  I went on  I soldiered on with psychiatry  and found myself training in Britain in some of the best hospitals in this country. I was very privileged. I worked in a team of incredibly talented  compassionate  but most importantly  highly trained  specialized mental health professionals. Soon after my training  I found myself working first in Zimbabwe and then in India  and I was confronted by an altogether new reality. This was a reality of a world in which there were almost no mental health professionals at all. In Zimbabwe  for example  there were just about a dozen psychiatrists  most of whom lived and worked in Harare city  leaving only a couple to address the mental health care needs of nine million people living in the countryside. In India  I found the situation was not a lot better. To give you a perspective  if I had to translate the proportion of psychiatrists in the population that one might see in Britain to India  one might expect roughly         psychiatrists in India. In reality  take a guess. The actual number is about        about two percent of that number. It became quickly apparent to me that I couldn't follow the sorts of mental health care models that I had been trained in  one that relied heavily on specialized  expensive mental health professionals to provide mental health care in countries like India and Zimbabwe. I had to think out of the box about some other model of care. It was then that I came across these books  and in these books I discovered the idea of task shifting in global health. The idea is actually quite simple. The idea is  when you're short of specialized health care professionals  use whoever is available in the community  train them to provide a range of health care interventions  and in these books I read inspiring examples  for example of how ordinary people had been trained to deliver babies  diagnose and treat early pneumonia  to great effect. And it struck me that if you could train ordinary people to deliver such complex health care interventions  then perhaps they could also do the same with mental health care. Well today  I'm very pleased to report to you that there have been many experiments in task shifting in mental health care across the developing world over the past decade  and I want to share with you the findings of three particular such experiments  all three of which focused on depression  the most common of all mental illnesses. In rural Uganda  Paul Bolton and his colleagues  using villagers  demonstrated that they could deliver interpersonal psychotherapy for depression and  using a randomized control design  showed that    percent of the people receiving this intervention recovered as compared to roughly    percent in the comparison villages. Similarly  using a randomized control trial in rural Pakistan  Atif Rahman and his colleagues showed that lady health visitors  who are community maternal health workers in Pakistan's health care system  could deliver cognitive behavior therapy for mothers who were depressed  again showing dramatic differences in the recovery rates. Roughly    percent of mothers recovered as compared to about    percent in the comparison villages. And in my own trial in Goa  in India  we again showed that lay counselors drawn from local communities could be trained to deliver psychosocial interventions for depression  anxiety  leading to    percent recovery rates as compared to    percent in the comparison primary health centers. Now  if I had to draw together all these different experiments in task shifting  and there have of course been many other examples  and try and identify what are the key lessons we can learn that makes for a successful task shifting operation  I have coined this particular acronym  SUNDAR. What SUNDAR stands for  in Hindi  is  attractive.  It seems to me that there are five key lessons that I've shown on this slide that are critically important for effective task shifting. The first is that we need to simplify the message that we're using  stripping away all the jargon that medicine has invented around itself. We need to unpack complex health care interventions into smaller components that can be more easily transferred to less trained individuals. We need to deliver health care  not in large institutions  but close to people's homes  and we need to deliver health care using whoever is available and affordable in our local communities. And importantly  we need to reallocate the few specialists who are available to perform roles such as capacity building and supervision. Now for me  task shifting is an idea with truly global significance  because even though it has arisen out of the situation of the lack of resources that you find in developing countries  I think it has a lot of significance for better resourced countries as well. Why is that  Well  in part  because health care in the developed world  the health care costs in the  developed  world  are rapidly spiraling out of control  and a huge chunk of those costs are human resource costs. But equally important is because health care has become so incredibly professionalized that it's become very remote and removed from local communities. For me  what's truly sundar about the idea of task shifting  though  isn't that it simply makes health care more accessible and affordable but that it is also fundamentally empowering. It empowers ordinary people to be more effective in caring for the health of others in their community  and in doing so  to become better guardians of their own health. Indeed  for me  task shifting is the ultimate example of the democratization of medical knowledge  and therefore  medical power. Just over    years ago  the nations of the world assembled at Alma Ata and made this iconic declaration. Well  I think all of you can guess that    years on  we're still nowhere near that goal. Still  today  armed with that knowledge that ordinary people in the community can be trained and  with sufficient supervision and support  can deliver a range of health care interventions effectively  perhaps that promise is within reach now. Indeed  to implement the slogan of Health for All  we will need to involve all in that particular journey  and in the case of mental health  in particular we would need to involve people who are affected by mental illness and their caregivers. It is for this reason that  some years ago  the Movement for Global Mental Health was founded as a sort of a virtual platform upon which professionals like myself and people affected by mental illness could stand together  shoulder to shoulder  and advocate for the rights of people with mental illness to receive the care that we know can transform their lives  and to live a life with dignity. And in closing  when you have a moment of peace or quiet in these very busy few days or perhaps afterwards  spare a thought for that person you thought about who has a mental illness  or persons that you thought about who have mental illness  and dare to care for them. Thank you.  Applause  Hi. So I'd like to talk a little bit about the people who make the things we use every day  our shoes  our handbags  our computers and cell phones. Now  this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt. Imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes  or the young Chinese man who jumps off a rooftop after working overtime assembling your iPad. We  the beneficiaries of globalization  seem to exploit these victims with every purchase we make  and the injustice feels embedded in the products themselves. After all  what's wrong with a world in which a worker on an iPhone assembly line can't even afford to buy one  It's taken for granted that Chinese factories are oppressive  and that it's our desire for cheap goods that makes them so. So  this simple narrative equating Western demand and Chinese suffering is appealing  especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world  but it's also inaccurate and disrespectful. We must be peculiarly self obsessed to imagine that we have the power to drive tens of millions of people on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer in such terrible ways. In fact  China makes goods for markets all over the world  including its own  thanks to a combination of factors  its low costs  its large and educated workforce  and a flexible manufacturing system that responds quickly to market demands. By focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets  we have rendered the individuals on the other end into invisibility  as tiny and interchangeable as the parts of a mobile phone. Chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for iPods. They choose to leave their homes in order to earn money  to learn new skills  and to see the world. In the ongoing debate about globalization  what's been missing is the voices of the workers themselves. Here are a few. Bao Yongxiu   My mother tells me to come home and get married  but if I marry now  before I have fully developed myself  I can only marry an ordinary worker  so I'm not in a rush.  Chen Ying   When I went home for the new year  everyone said I had changed. They asked me  what did you do that you have changed so much  I told them that I studied and worked hard. If you tell them more  they won't understand anyway.  Wu Chunming   Even if I make a lot of money  it won't satisfy me. Just to make money is not enough meaning in life.  Xiao Jin   Now  after I get off work  I study English  because in the future  our customers won't be only Chinese  so we must learn more languages.  All of these speakers  by the way  are young women     or    years old. So I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers like these in the south China factory city called Dongguan. Certain subjects came up over and over  how much money they made  what kind of husband they hoped to marry  whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were. Other subjects came up almost never  including living conditions that to me looked close to prison life     or    workers in one room     people sharing a single bathroom  days and nights ruled by the factory clock. Everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances  and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural China. The workers rarely spoke about the products they made  and they often had great difficulty explaining what exactly they did. When I asked Lu Qingmin  the young woman I got to know best  what exactly she did on the factory floor  she said something to me in Chinese that sounded like  qiu xi.  Only much later did I realize that she had been saying  QC   or quality control. She couldn't even tell me what she did on the factory floor. All she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation in a language she didn't even understand. Karl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism  the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor. Unlike  say  a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets  the worker in an industrial factory has no control  no pleasure  and no true satisfaction or understanding in her own work. But like so many theories that Marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the British Museum  he got this one wrong. Just because a person spends her time making a piece of something does not mean that she becomes that  a piece of something. What she does with the money she earns  what she learns in that place  and how it changes her  these are the things that matter. What a factory makes is never the point  and the workers could not care less who buys their products. Journalistic coverage of Chinese factories  on the other hand  plays up this relationship between the workers and the products they make. Many articles calculate  How long would it take for this worker to work in order to earn enough money to buy what he's making  For example  an entry level line assembly line worker in China in an iPhone plant would have to shell out two and a half months' wages for an iPhone. But how meaningful is this calculation  really  For example  I recently wrote an article in The New Yorker magazine  but I can't afford to buy an ad in it. But  who cares  I don't want an ad in The New Yorker  and most of these workers don't really want iPhones. Their calculations are different. How long should I stay in this factory  How much money can I save  How much will it take to buy an apartment or a car  to get married  or to put my child through school  The workers I got to know had a curiously abstract relationship with the product of their labor. About a year after I met Lu Qingmin  or Min  she invited me home to her family village for the Chinese New Year. On the train home  she gave me a present  a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim. I thanked her  assuming it was fake  like almost everything else for sale in Dongguan. After we got home  Min gave her mother another present  a pink Dooney   Bourke handbag  and a few nights later  her sister was showing off a maroon LeSportsac shoulder bag. Slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags were made by their factory  and every single one of them was authentic. Min's sister said to her parents   In America  this bag sells for     dollars.  Her parents  who are both farmers  looked on  speechless.  And that's not all    Coach is coming out with a new line         she said.  One bag will sell for      .  She paused and said   I don't know if that's       yuan or       American dollars  but anyway  it's      .   Laughter  Min's sister's boyfriend  who had traveled home with her for the new year  said   It doesn't look like it's worth that much.  Min's sister turned to him and said   Some people actually understand these things. You don't understand shit.  In Min's world  the Coach bags had a curious currency. They weren't exactly worthless  but they were nothing close to the actual value  because almost no one they knew wanted to buy one  or knew how much it was worth. Once  when Min's older sister's friend got married  she brought a handbag along as a wedding present. Another time  after Min had already left the handbag factory  her younger sister came to visit  bringing two Coach Signature handbags as gifts. I looked in the zippered pocket of one  and I found a printed card in English  which read   An American classic. In       the burnished patina of an all American baseball glove inspired the founder of Coach to create a new collection of handbags from the same luxuriously soft gloved hand leather. Six skilled leatherworkers crafted    Signature handbags with perfect proportions and a timeless flair. They were fresh  functional  and women everywhere adored them. A new American classic was born.  I wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min and her sisters. Their relationship with the product of their labor was more complicated  surprising and funny than he could have imagined. And yet  his view of the world persists  and our tendency to see the workers as faceless masses  to imagine that we can know what they're really thinking. The first time I met Min  she had just turned    and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory. Over the next two years  I watched as she switched jobs five times  eventually landing a lucrative post in the purchasing department of a hardware factory. Later  she married a fellow migrant worker  moved with him to his village  gave birth to two daughters  and saved enough money to buy a secondhand Buick for herself and an apartment for her parents. She recently returned to Dongguan on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes  temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village. In a recent email to me  she explained   A person should have some ambition while she is young so that in old age she can look back on her life and feel that it was not lived to no purpose.  Across China  there are     million workers like her  one third of them women  who have left their villages to work in the factories  the hotels  the restaurants and the construction sites of the big cities. Together  they make up the largest migration in history  and it is globalization  this chain that begins in a Chinese farming village and ends with iPhones in our pockets and Nikes on our feet and Coach handbags on our arms that has changed the way these millions of people work and marry and live and think. Very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be. When I first went to Dongguan  I worried that it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers. I also worried that nothing would ever happen to them  or that they would have nothing to say to me. Instead  I found young women who were smart and funny and brave and generous. By opening up their lives to me  they taught me so much about factories and about China and about how to live in the world. This is the Coach purse that Min gave me on the train home to visit her family. I keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me to the young women I wrote about  ties that are not economic but personal in nature  measured not in money but in memories. This purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine  sitting in your office or in the library  are not how you find them when you actually go out into the world. Thank you.  Applause  Chris Anderson  Thank you  Leslie  that was an insight that a lot of us haven't had before. But I'm curious. If you had a minute  say  with Apple's head of manufacturing  what would you say  Leslie Chang  One minute  CA  One minute.  Laughter  LC  You know  what really impressed me about the workers is how much they're self motivated  self driven  resourceful  and the thing that struck me  what they want most is education  to learn  because most of them come from very poor backgrounds. They usually left school when they were in  th or  th grade. Their parents are often illiterate  and then they come to the city  and they  on their own  at night  during the weekends  they'll take a computer class  they'll take an English class  and learn really  really rudimentary things  you know  like how to type a document in Word  or how to say really simple things in English. So  if you really want to help these workers  start these small  very focused  very pragmatic classes in these schools  and what's going to happen is  all your workers are going to move on  but hopefully they'll move on into higher jobs within Apple  and you can help their social mobility and their self improvement. When you talk to workers  that's what they want. They do not say   I want better hot water in the showers. I want a nicer room. I want a TV set.  I mean  it would be nice to have those things  but that's not why they're in the city  and that's not what they care about. CA  Was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad  or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth  that things over time were getting better  LC  Oh definitely  definitely. I mean  you know  it was interesting  because I spent basically two years hanging out in this city  Dongguan  and over that time  you could see immense change in every person's life  upward  downward  sideways  but generally upward. If you spend enough time  it's upward  and I met people who had moved to the city    years ago  and who are now basically urban middle class people  so the trajectory is definitely upward. It's just hard to see when you're suddenly sucked into the city. It looks like everyone's poor and desperate  but that's not really how it is. Certainly  the factory conditions are really tough  and it's nothing you or I would want to do  but from their perspective  where they're coming from is much worse  and where they're going is hopefully much better  and I just wanted to give that context of what's going on in their minds  not what necessarily is going on in yours. CA  Thanks so much for your talk. Thank you very much.  Applause  So  embryonic stem cells are really incredible cells. They are our body's own repair kits  and they're pluripotent  which means they can morph into all of the cells in our bodies. Soon  we actually will be able to use stem cells to replace cells that are damaged or diseased. But that's not what I want to talk to you about  because right now there are some really extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells that are completely changing the way we look and model disease  our ability to understand why we get sick  and even develop drugs. I truly believe that stem cell research is going to allow our children to look at Alzheimer's and diabetes and other major diseases the way we view polio today  which is as a preventable disease. So here we have this incredible field  which has enormous hope for humanity  but much like IVF over    years ago  until the birth of a healthy baby  Louise  this field has been under siege politically and financially. Critical research is being challenged instead of supported  and we saw that it was really essential to have private safe haven laboratories where this work could be advanced without interference. And so  in       we started the New York Stem Cell Foundation Laboratory so that we would have a small organization that could do this work and support it. What we saw very quickly is the world of both medical research  but also developing drugs and treatments  is dominated by  as you would expect  large organizations  but in a new field  sometimes large organizations really have trouble getting out of their own way  and sometimes they can't ask the right questions  and there is an enormous gap that's just gotten larger between academic research on the one hand and pharmaceutical companies and biotechs that are responsible for delivering all of our drugs and many of our treatments  and so we knew that to really accelerate cures and therapies  we were going to have to address this with two things  new technologies and also a new research model. Because if you don't close that gap  you really are exactly where we are today. And that's what I want to focus on. We've spent the last couple of years pondering this  making a list of the different things that we had to do  and so we developed a new technology  It's software and hardware  that actually can generate thousands and thousands of genetically diverse stem cell lines to create a global array  essentially avatars of ourselves. And we did this because we think that it's actually going to allow us to realize the potential  the promise  of all of the sequencing of the human genome  but it's going to allow us  in doing that  to actually do clinical trials in a dish with human cells  not animal cells  to generate drugs and treatments that are much more effective  much safer  much faster  and at a much lower cost. So let me put that in perspective for you and give you some context. This is an extremely new field. In       human embryonic stem cells were first identified  and just nine years later  a group of scientists in Japan were able to take skin cells and reprogram them with very powerful viruses to create a kind of pluripotent stem cell called an induced pluripotent stem cell  or what we refer to as an IPS cell. This was really an extraordinary advance  because although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells  which still remain the gold standard  they are terrific to use for modeling disease and potentially for drug discovery. So a few months later  in       one of our scientists built on that research. He took skin biopsies  this time from people who had a disease  ALS  or as you call it in the U.K.  motor neuron disease. He turned them into the IPS cells that I've just told you about  and then he turned those IPS cells into the motor neurons that actually were dying in the disease. So basically what he did was to take a healthy cell and turn it into a sick cell  and he recapitulated the disease over and over again in the dish  and this was extraordinary  because it was the first time that we had a model of a disease from a living patient in living human cells. And as he watched the disease unfold  he was able to discover that actually the motor neurons were dying in the disease in a different way than the field had previously thought. There was another kind of cell that actually was sending out a toxin and contributing to the death of these motor neurons  and you simply couldn't see it until you had the human model. So you could really say that researchers trying to understand the cause of disease without being able to have human stem cell models were much like investigators trying to figure out what had gone terribly wrong in a plane crash without having a black box  or a flight recorder. They could hypothesize about what had gone wrong  but they really had no way of knowing what led to the terrible events. And stem cells really have given us the black box for diseases  and it's an unprecedented window. It really is extraordinary  because you can recapitulate many  many diseases in a dish  you can see what begins to go wrong in the cellular conversation well before you would ever see symptoms appear in a patient. And this opens up the ability  which hopefully will become something that is routine in the near term  of using human cells to test for drugs. Right now  the way we test for drugs is pretty problematic. To bring a successful drug to market  it takes  on average     years   that's one drug   with a sunk cost of   billion dollars  and only one percent of the drugs that start down that road are actually going to get there. You can't imagine other businesses that you would think of going into that have these kind of numbers. It's a terrible business model. But it is really a worse social model because of what's involved and the cost to all of us. So the way we develop drugs now is by testing promising compounds on    We didn't have disease modeling with human cells  so we'd been testing them on cells of mice or other creatures or cells that we engineer  but they don't have the characteristics of the diseases that we're actually trying to cure. You know  we're not mice  and you can't go into a living person with an illness and just pull out a few brain cells or cardiac cells and then start fooling around in a lab to test for  you know  a promising drug. But what you can do with human stem cells  now  is actually create avatars  and you can create the cells  whether it's the live motor neurons or the beating cardiac cells or liver cells or other kinds of cells  and you can test for drugs  promising compounds  on the actual cells that you're trying to affect  and this is now  and it's absolutely extraordinary  and you're going to know at the beginning  the very early stages of doing your assay development and your testing  you're not going to have to wait    years until you've brought a drug to market  only to find out that actually it doesn't work  or even worse  harms people. But it isn't really enough just to look at the cells from a few people or a small group of people  because we have to step back. We've got to look at the big picture. Look around this room. We are all different  and a disease that I might have  if I had Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease  it probably would affect me differently than if one of you had that disease  and if we both had Parkinson's disease  and we took the same medication  but we had different genetic makeup  we probably would have a different result  and it could well be that a drug that worked wonderfully for me was actually ineffective for you  and similarly  it could be that a drug that is harmful for you is safe for me  and  you know  this seems totally obvious  but unfortunately it is not the way that the pharmaceutical industry has been developing drugs because  until now  it hasn't had the tools. And so we need to move away from this one size fits all model. The way we've been developing drugs is essentially like going into a shoe store  no one asks you what size you are  or if you're going dancing or hiking. They just say   Well  you have feet  here are your shoes.  It doesn't work with shoes  and our bodies are many times more complicated than just our feet. So we really have to change this. There was a very sad example of this in the last decade. There's a wonderful drug  and a class of drugs actually  but the particular drug was Vioxx  and for people who were suffering from severe arthritis pain  the drug was an absolute lifesaver  but unfortunately  for another subset of those people  they suffered pretty severe heart side effects  and for a subset of those people  the side effects were so severe  the cardiac side effects  that they were fatal. But imagine a different scenario  where we could have had an array  a genetically diverse array  of cardiac cells  and we could have actually tested that drug  Vioxx  in petri dishes  and figured out  well  okay  people with this genetic type are going to have cardiac side effects  people with these genetic subgroups or genetic shoes sizes  about        of them  are not going to have any problems. The people for whom it was a lifesaver could have still taken their medicine. The people for whom it was a disaster  or fatal  would never have been given it  and you can imagine a very different outcome for the company  who had to withdraw the drug. So that is terrific  and we thought  all right  as we're trying to solve this problem  clearly we have to think about genetics  we have to think about human testing  but there's a fundamental problem  because right now  stem cell lines  as extraordinary as they are  and lines are just groups of cells  they are made by hand  one at a time  and it takes a couple of months. This is not scalable  and also when you do things by hand  even in the best laboratories  you have variations in techniques  and you need to know  if you're making a drug  that the Aspirin you're going to take out of the bottle on Monday is the same as the Aspirin that's going to come out of the bottle on Wednesday. So we looked at this  and we thought  okay  artisanal is wonderful in  you know  your clothing and your bread and crafts  but artisanal really isn't going to work in stem cells  so we have to deal with this. But even with that  there still was another big hurdle  and that actually brings us back to the mapping of the human genome  because we're all different. We know from the sequencing of the human genome that it's shown us all of the A's  C's  G's and T's that make up our genetic code  but that code  by itself  our DNA  is like looking at the ones and zeroes of the computer code without having a computer that can read it. It's like having an app without having a smartphone. We needed to have a way of bringing the biology to that incredible data  and the way to do that was to find a stand in  a biological stand in  that could contain all of the genetic information  but have it be arrayed in such a way as it could be read together and actually create this incredible avatar. We need to have stem cells from all the genetic sub types that represent who we are. So this is what we've built. It's an automated robotic technology. It has the capacity to produce thousands and thousands of stem cell lines. It's genetically arrayed. It has massively parallel processing capability  and it's going to change the way drugs are discovered  we hope  and I think eventually what's going to happen is that we're going to want to re screen drugs  on arrays like this  that already exist  all of the drugs that currently exist  and in the future  you're going to be taking drugs and treatments that have been tested for side effects on all of the relevant cells  on brain cells and heart cells and liver cells. It really has brought us to the threshold of personalized medicine. It's here now  and in our family  my son has type   diabetes  which is still an incurable disease  and I lost my parents to heart disease and cancer  but I think that my story probably sounds familiar to you  because probably a version of it is your story. At some point in our lives  all of us  or people we care about  become patients  and that's why I think that stem cell research is incredibly important for all of us. Thank you.  Applause  As you might imagine  I'm absolutely passionate about dance. I'm passionate about making it  about watching it  about encouraging others to participate in it  and I'm also really passionate about creativity. Creativity for me is something that's absolutely critical  and I think it's something that you can teach. I think the technicities of creativity can be taught and shared  and I think you can find out things about your own personal physical signature  your own cognitive habits  and use that as a point of departure to misbehave beautifully. I was born in the     s  and John Travolta was big in those days   Grease    Saturday Night Fever   and he provided a fantastic kind of male role model for me to start dancing. My parents were very up for me going. They absolutely encouraged me to take risks  to go  to try  to try. I had an opportunity  an access to a local dance studio  and I had an enlightened teacher who allowed me to make up my own and invent my own dances  so what she did was let me make up my own ballroom and Latin American dances to teach to my peers. And that was the very first time that I found an opportunity to feel that I was able to express my own voice  and that's what's fueled me  then  to become a choreographer. I feel like I've got something to say and something to share. And I guess what's interesting is  is that I am now obsessed with the technology of the body. I think it's the most technologically literate thing that we have  and I'm absolutely obsessed with finding a way of communicating ideas through the body to audiences that might move them  touch them  help them think differently about things. So for me  choreography is very much a process of physical thinking. It's very much in mind  as well as in body  and it's a collaborative process. It's something that I have to do with other people. You know  it's a distributed cognitive process in a way. I work often with designers and visual artists  obviously dancers and other choreographers  but also  more and more  with economists  anthropologists  neuroscientists  cognitive scientists  people really who come from very different domains of expertise  where they bring their intelligence to bear on a different kind of creative process. What I thought we would do today a little bit is explore this idea of physical thinking  and we're all experts in physical thinking. Yeah  you all have a body  right  And we all know what that body is like in the real world  so one of the aspects of physical thinking that we think about a lot is this notion of proprioception  the sense of my own body in the space in the real world. So  we all understand what it feels like to know where the ends of your fingers are when you hold out your arms  yeah  You absolutely know that when you're going to grab a cup  or that cup moves and you have to renavigate it. So we're experts in physical thinking already. We just don't think about our bodies very much. We only think about them when they go wrong  so  when there's a broken arm  or when you have a heart attack  then you become really very aware of your bodies. But how is it that we can start to think about using choreographic thinking  kinesthetic intelligence  to arm the ways in which we think about things more generally  What I thought I'd do is  I'd make a TED premiere. I'm not sure if this is going to be good or not. I'll just be doing it. I thought what I'd do is  I'd use three versions of physical thinking to make something. I want to introduce you. This is Paolo. This is Catarina. They have no idea what we're going to do. So this is not the type of choreography where I already have in mind what I'm going to make  where I've fixed the routine in my head and I'm just going to teach it to them  and these so called empty vessels are just going to learn it. That's not the methodology at all that we work with. But what's important about it is how it is that they're grasping information  how they're taking information  how they're using it  and how they're thinking with it. I'm going to start really  really simply. Usually  dance has a stimulus or stimuli  and I thought I'd take something simple  TED logo  we can all see it  it's quite easy to work with  and I'm going to do something very simply  where you take one idea from a body  and it happens to be my body  and translate that into somebody else's body  so it's a direct transfer  transformation of energy. And I'm going to imagine this  you can do this too if you like  that I'm going to just take the letter  T  and I'm going to imagine it in mind  and I'm going to place that outside in the real world. So I absolutely see a letter  T  in front of me. Yeah  It's absolutely there. I can absolutely walk around it when I see it  yeah  It has a kind of a grammar. I know what I'm going to do with it  and I can start to describe it  so I can describe it very simply. I can describe it in my arms  right  So all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand. I can describe it  whoa  in my head  you know  Whoa. Okay. I can do also my shoulder. Yeah  It gives me something to do  something to work towards. If I were to take that letter  T  and flatten it down on the floor  here  maybe just off the floor  all of a sudden I could do maybe something with my knee  yeah  Whoa. So If I put the knee and the arms together  I've got something physical  yeah  And I can start to build something. So what I'm going to do just for one and a half minutes or so is I'm going to take that concept  I'm going to make something  and the dancers behind me are going to interpret it  they're going to snapshot it  they're going to take aspects of it  and it's almost like I'm offloading memory and they're holding onto memory  Yeah  And we'll see what we come up with. So just have a little watch about how they're  how they're accessing this and what they're doing  and I'm just going to take this letter  T   the letter  E   and the letter  D   to make something. Okay. Here goes. So I have to get myself in the zone. Right. It's a bit of a cross of my arm. So all I'm doing is exploring this space of  T  and flashing through it with some action. I'm not remembering what I'm doing. I'm just working on my task. My task is this  T.  Going to watch it from the side  whoa. Strike moment. That's it. So we're starting to build a phrase. So what they're doing  let's see  something like that  so what they're doing is grasping aspects of that movement and they're generating it into a phrase. You can see the speed is extremely quick  yeah  I'm not asking them to copy exactly. They're using the information that they receive to generate the beginnings of a phrase. I can watch that and that can tell me something about how it is that they're moving. Yeah  they're super quick  right  So I've taken this aspect of TED and translated it into something that's physical. Some dancers  when they're watching action  take the overall shape  the arc of the movement  the kinetic sense of the movement  and use that for memory. Some work very much in specific detail. They start with small little units and build it up. Okay  you've got something  One more thing. So they're solving this problem for me  having a little    They're constructing that phrase. They have something and they're going to hold on to it  yeah  One way of making. That's going to be my beginning in this world premiere. Okay. From there I'm going to do a very different thing. So basically I'm going to make a duet. I want you to think about them as architectural objects  so what they are  are just pure lines. They're no longer people  just pure lines  and I'm going to work with them almost as objects to think with  yeah  So what I'm thinking about is taking a few physical extensions from the body as I move  and I move them  and I do that by suggesting things to them  If  then  if  then. Okay  so here we go. Just grab this arm. Can you place that down into the floor  Yeah  down to the floor. Can you go underneath  Yeah. Cat  can you put leg over that side  Yeah. Can you rotate  Whoom  just go back to the beginning. Here we go  ready  And ... bam  bake ...  clicks metronome  Great. Okay  from there  you're both getting up. You're both getting up. Here we go. Good  now  Them. So from there  from there  we're both getting up  we're both getting up  going in this direction  going underneath. Whoa  whoa  underneath. Whoa  underneath  whoo um. Yeah  Underneath. Jump. Underneath. Jump. Paolo  kick. Don't care where. Kick. Kick  replace  change a leg. Kick  replace  change the leg. Yeah  Okay  Cat  almost get his head. Almost get his head. Whoaa. Just after it  maybe. Whoaa  whaaay  ooh. Grab her waist  come up back into her first  whoom  spin  turn her  whoo aa.  Snaps  Great. Okay  let's have a little go from the beginning of that. Just  let me slow down here. Fancy having eight     Laughter  Fancy having eight hours with me in a day. So  maybe too much. So  here we go  ready  and     Clicks metronome  Nice  good job. Yeah  Okay.  Applause  Okay  not bad.  Applause  A little bit more  Yeah. Just a little bit more  here we go  from that place. Separate. Face the front. Separate. Face the front. Imagine that there's a circle in front of you  yeah  Avoid it. Avoid it. Whoom. Kick it out of the way. Kick it out of the way. Throw it into the audience. Whoom. Throw it into the audience again. We've got mental architecture  we're sharing it  therefore solving a problem. They're enacting it. Let me just see that a little bit. Ready  and go. Okay  brilliant. Okay  here we go. From the beginning  can we do our phrases first  And then that. And we're going to build something now  organize it  the phrases. Here we go. Nice and slow  Ready and go ... um.  Clicks metronome  The duet starts.  Clicks metronome  So yeah  okay  good. Okay  nice  very nice.  Applause  So good. So     Applause  Okay. So that was     Applause  Well done.  Applause  That was the second way of working. The first one  body to body transfer  yeah  with an outside mental architecture that I work with that they hold memory with for me. The second one  which is using them as objects to think with their architectural objects  I do a series of provocations  I say   If this happens  then that. If this  if that happens      I've got lots of methods like that  but it's very  very quick  and this is a third method. They're starting it already  and this is a task based method  where they have the autonomy to make all of the decisions for themselves. So I'd like us just to do  we're going to do a little mental dance  a little  in this little one minute  so what I'd love you to do is imagine  you can do this with your eyes closed  or open  and if you don't want to do it you can watch them  it's up to you. Just for a second  think about that word  TED  in front of you  so it's in mind  and it's there right in front of your mind. What I'd like you to do is transplant that outside into the real world  so just imagine that word  TED  in the real world. What I'd like you to do what that is take an aspect of it. I'm going to zone in on the  E   and I'm going to scale that  E  so it's absolutely massive  so I'm scaling that  E  so it's absolutely massive  and then I'm going to give it dimensionality. I'm going to think about it in  D space. So now  instead of it just being a letter that's in front of me  it's a space that my body can go inside of. I now decide where I'm going to be in that space  so I'm down on this small part of the bottom rib of the letter  E   and I'm thinking about it  and I'm imagining this space that's really high and above. If I asked you to reach out   you don't have to literally do it  but in mind   reach out to the top of the  E   where would you reach  If you reach with your finger  where would it be  If you reach with your elbow  where would it be  If I already then said about that space that you're in  let's infuse it with the color red  what does that do to the body  If I then said to you  what happens if that whole wall on the side of  E  collapses and you have to use your weight to put it back up  what would you be able to do with it  So this is a mental picture  I'm describing a mental  vivid picture that enables dancers to make choices for themselves about what to make. Okay  you can open your eyes if you had them closed. So the dancers have been working on them. So just keep working on them for a little second. So they've been working on those mental architectures in the here. I know  I think we should keep them as a surprise. So here goes  world premiere dance. Yeah  Here we go. TED dance. Okay. Here it comes. I'm going to organize it quickly. So  you're going to do the first solo that we made  yeah blah blah blah blah  we go into the duet  yeah  blah blah blah blah. The next solo  blah blah blah blah  yeah  and both at the same time  you do the last solutions. Okay  Okay. Ladies and gentlemen  world premiere  TED dance  three versions of physical thinking.  Applause  Well  clap afterwards  let's see if it's any good  yeah   Laughter  So yeah  let's clap    yeah  let's clap afterwards. Here we go. Catarina  big moment  here we go  one. Here it comes  Cat.  Clicks metronome  Paolo  go.  Clicks metronome  Last you solo. The one you made.  Clicks metronome  Well done. Okay  good. Super. So    So     Applause  Thank you.  Applause  So    three versions.  Applause  Oh.  Laughs  Three versions of physical thinking. I'm hoping that today  what you're going to do is go away and make a dance for yourself  and if not that  at least misbehave more beautifully  more often. Thank you very much.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Here we go.  Applause  So when the White House was built in the early   th century  it was an open house. Neighbors came and went. Under President Adams  a local dentist happened by. He wanted to shake the President's hand. The President dismissed the Secretary of State  whom he was conferring with  and asked the dentist if he would remove a tooth. Later  in the     s  under President Pierce  he was known to have remarked   probably the only thing he's known for   when a neighbor passed by and said   I'd love to see the beautiful house   and Pierce said to him   Why my dear sir  of course you may come in. This isn't my house. It is the people's house.  Well  when I got to the White House in the beginning of       at the start of the Obama Administration  the White House was anything but open. Bomb blast curtains covered my windows. We were running Windows     . Social media were blocked at the firewall. We didn't have a blog  let alone a dozen twitter accounts like we have today. I came in to become the head of Open Government  to take the values and the practices of transparency  participation and collaboration  and instill them into the way that we work  to open up government  to work with people. Now one of the things that we know is that companies are very good at getting people to work together in teams and in networks to make very complex products  like cars and computers  and the more complex the products are a society creates  the more successful the society is over time. Companies make goods  but governments  they make public goods. They work on the cure for cancer and educating our children and making roads  but we don't have institutions that are particularly good at this kind of complexity. We don't have institutions that are good at bringing our talents to bear  at working with us in this kind of open and collaborative way. So when we wanted to create our Open Government policy  what did we do  We wanted  naturally  to ask public sector employees how we should open up government. Turns out that had never been done before. We wanted to ask members of the public to help us come up with a policy  not after the fact  commenting on a rule after it's written  the way is typically the case  but in advance. There was no legal precedent  no cultural precedent  no technical way of doing this. In fact  many people told us it was illegal. Here's the crux of the obstacle. Governments exist to channel the flow of two things  really  values and expertise to and from government and to and from citizens to the end of making decisions. But the way that our institutions are designed  in our rather   th century  centralized model  is to channel the flow of values through voting  once every four years  once every two years  at best  once a year. This is a rather anemic and thin way  in this era of social media  for us to actually express our values. Today we have technology that lets us express ourselves a great deal  perhaps a little too much. Then in the   th century  we layer on the concept of bureaucracy and the administrative state to help us govern complex and large societies. But we've centralized these bureaucracies. We've entrenched them. And we know that the smartest person always works for someone else. We need to only look around this room to know that expertise and intelligence is widely distributed in society  and not limited simply to our institutions. Scientists have been studying in recent years the phenomenon that they often describe as flow  that the design of our systems  whether natural or social  channel the flow of whatever runs through them. So a river is designed to channel the flow of water  and the lightning bolt that comes out of a cloud channels the flow of electricity  and a leaf is designed to channel the flow of nutrients to the tree  sometimes even having to route around an obstacle  but to get that nutrition flowing. The same can be said for our social systems  for our systems of government  where  at the very least  flow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding what the problem is  what's really broken  and the urgent need that we have  that we all feel today  to redesign the flow of our institutions. We live in a Cambrian era of big data  of social networks  and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions that are actually quite recent. Think about it  What other business do you know  what other sector of the economy  and especially one as big as the public sector  that doesn't seek to reinvent its business model on a regular basis  Sure  we invest plenty in innovation. We invest in broadband and science education and science grants  but we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning the institutions that we have. Now  it's very easy to complain  of course  about partisan politics and entrenched bureaucracy  and we love to complain about government. It's a perennial pastime  especially around election time  but the world is complex. We soon will have    billion people  many of whom will lack basic resources. So complain as we might  what actually can replace what we have today  What comes the day after the Arab Spring  Well  one attractive alternative that obviously presents itself to us is that of networks. Right  Networks like Facebook and Twitter. They're lean. They're mean. You've got       employees at Facebook governing     million inhabitants. We might even call them citizens  because they've recently risen up to fight against legislative incursion  and the citizens of these networks work together to serve each other in great ways. But private communities  private  corporate  privatizing communities  are not bottom up democracies. They cannot replace government. Friending someone on Facebook is not complex enough to do the hard work of you and I collaborating with each other and doing the hard work of governance. But social media do teach us something. Why is Twitter so successful  Because it opens up its platform. It opens up the API to allow hundreds of thousands of new applications to be built on top of it  so that we can read and process information in new and exciting ways. We need to think about how to open up the API of government  and the way that we're going to do that  the next great superpower is going to be the one who can successfully combine the hierarchy of institution    because we have to maintain those public values  we have to coordinate the flow    but with the diversity and the pulsating life and the chaos and the excitement of networks  all of us working together to build these new innovations on top of our institutions  to engage in the practice of governance. We have a precedent for this. Good old Henry II here  in the   th century  invented the jury. Powerful  practical  palpable model for handing power from government to citizens. Today we have the opportunity  and we have the imperative  to create thousands of new ways of interconnecting between networks and institutions  thousands of new kinds of juries  the citizen jury  the Carrotmob  the hackathon  we are just beginning to invent the models by which we can cocreate the process of governance. Now  we don't fully have a picture of what this will look like yet  but we're seeing pockets of evolution emerging all around us    maybe not even evolution  I'd even start to call it a revolution    in the way that we govern. Some of it's very high tech  and some of it is extremely low tech  such as the project that MKSS is running in Rajasthan  India  where they take the spending data of the state and paint it on         village walls  and then invite the villagers to come and comment who is on the government payroll  who's actually died  what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere  and to work together through civic engagement to save real money and participate and have access to that budget. But it's not just about policing government. It's also about creating government. Spacehive in the U.K. is engaging in crowd funding  getting you and me to raise the money to build the goalposts and the park benches that will actually allow us to deliver better services in our communities. No one is better at this activity of actually getting us to engage in delivering services  sometimes where none exist  than Ushahidi. Created after the post election riots in Kenya in       this crisis mapping website and community is actually able to crowdsource and target the delivery of better rescue services to people trapped under the rubble  whether it's after the earthquakes in Haiti  or more recently in Italy. And the Red Cross too is training volunteers and Twitter is certifying them  not simply to supplement existing government institutions  but in many cases  to replace them. Now what we're seeing lots of examples of  obviously  is the opening up of government data  not enough examples of this yet  but we're starting to see this practice of people creating and generating innovative applications on top of government data. There's so many examples I could have picked  and I selected this one of Jon Bon Jovi. Some of you may or may not know that he runs a soup kitchen in New Jersey  where he caters to and serves the homeless and particularly homeless veterans. In February  he approached the White House  and said   I would like to fund a prize to create scalable national applications  apps  that will help not only the homeless but those who deliver services  to  them to do so better.  February      to June of       the finalists are announced in the competition. Can you imagine  in the bureaucratic world of yesteryear  getting anything done in a four month period of time  You can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time  let alone generate real  palpable innovations that improve people's lives. And I want to be clear to mention that this open government revolution is not about privatizing government  because in many cases what it can do when we have the will to do so is to deliver more progressive and better policy than the regulations and the legislative and litigation oriented strategies by which we make policy today. In the State of Texas  they regulate     professions  from well driller to florist. Now  you can carry a gun into a church in Dallas  but do not make a flower arrangement without a license  because that will land you in jail. So what is Texas doing  They're asking you and me  using online policy wikis  to help not simply get rid of burdensome regulations that impede entrepreneurship  but to replace those regulations with more innovative alternatives  sometimes using transparency in the creation of new iPhone apps that will allows us both to protect consumers and the public and to encourage economic development. That is a nice sideline of open government. It's not only the benefits that we've talked about with regard to development. It's the economic benefits and the job creation that's coming from this open innovation work. Sberbank  the largest and oldest bank in Russia  largely owned by the Russian government  has started practicing crowdsourcing  engaging its employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations. Last year they saved a billion dollars     billion rubles  from open innovation  and they're pushing radically the extension of crowdsourcing  not only from banking  but into the public sector. And we see lots of examples of these innovators using open government data  not simply to make apps  but then to make companies and to hire people to build them working with the government. So a lot of these innovations are local. In San Ramon  California  they published an iPhone app in which they allow you or me to say we are certified CPR trained  and then when someone has a heart attack  a notification goes out so that you can rush over to the person over here and deliver CPR. The victim who receives bystander CPR is more than twice as likely to survive.  There is a hero in all of us   is their slogan. But it's not limited to the local. British Columbia  Canada  is publishing a catalogue of all the ways that its residents and citizens can engage with the state in the cocreation of governance. Let me be very clear  and perhaps controversial  that open government is not about transparent government. Simply throwing data over the transom doesn't change how government works. It doesn't get anybody to do anything with that data to change lives  to solve problems  and it doesn't change government. What it does is it creates an adversarial relationship between civil society and government over the control and ownership of information. And transparency  by itself  is not reducing the flow of money into politics  and arguably  it's not even producing accountability as well as it might if we took the next step of combining participation and collaboration with transparency to transform how we work. We're going to see this evolution really in two phases  I think. The first phase of the open government revolution is delivering better information from the crowd into the center. Starting in       and this is how this open government work in the U.S. really got started  I was teaching a patent law class to my students and explaining to them how a single person in the bureaucracy has the power to make a decision about which patent application becomes the next patent  and therefore monopolizes for    years the rights over an entire field of inventive activity. Well  what did we do  We said  we can make a website  we can make an expert network  a social network  that would connect the network to the institution to allow scientists and technologists to get better information to the patent office to aid in making those decisions. We piloted the work in the U.S. and the U.K. and Japan and Australia  and now I'm pleased to report that the United States Patent Office will be rolling out universal  complete  and total openness  so that all patent applications will now be open for citizen participation  beginning this year. The second phase of this evolution   Yeah.  Applause  They deserve a hand.  Applause  The first phase is in getting better information in. The second phase is in getting decision making power out. Participatory budgeting has long been practiced in Porto Alegre  Brazil. They're just starting it in the   th Ward in Chicago. Russia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together  as is Lithuania. When we start to see power over the core functions of government   spending  legislation  decision making   then we're well on our way to an open government revolution. There are many things that we can do to get us there. Obviously opening up the data is one  but the important thing is to create lots more    create and curate    lots more participatory opportunities. Hackathons and mashathons and working with data to build apps is an intelligible way for people to engage and participate  like the jury is  but we're going to need lots more things like it. And that's why we need to start with our youngest people. We've heard talk here at TED about people biohacking and hacking their plants with Arduino  and Mozilla is doing work around the world in getting young people to build websites and make videos. When we start by teaching young people that we live  not in a passive society  a read only society  but in a writable society  where we have the power to change our communities  to change our institutions  that's when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway towards this open government innovation  towards this open government movement  towards this open government revolution. So let me close by saying that I think the important thing for us to do is to talk about and demand this revolution. We don't have words  really  to describe it yet. Words like equality and fairness and the traditional elections  democracy  these are not really great terms yet. They're not fun enough. They're not exciting enough to get us engaged in this tremendous opportunity that awaits us. But I would argue that if we want to see the kinds of innovations  the hopeful and exciting innovations that we hear talked about here at TED  in clean energy  in clean education  in development  if we want to see those adopted and we want to see those scaled  we want to see them become the governance of tomorrow  then we must all participate  then we must get involved. We must open up our institutions  and like the leaf  we must let the nutrients flow throughout our body politic  throughout our culture  to create open institutions to create a stronger democracy  a better tomorrow. Thank you.  Applause  The job of uncovering the global food waste scandal started for me when I was    years old. I bought some pigs. I was living in Sussex. And I started to feed them in the most traditional and environmentally friendly way. I went to my school kitchen  and I said   Give me the scraps that my school friends have turned their noses up at.  I went to the local baker and took their stale bread. I went to the local greengrocer  and I went to a farmer who was throwing away potatoes because they were the wrong shape or size for supermarkets. This was great. My pigs turned that food waste into delicious pork. I sold that pork to my school friends' parents  and I made a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance. But I noticed that most of the food that I was giving my pigs was in fact fit for human consumption  and that I was only scratching the surface  and that right the way up the food supply chain  in supermarkets  greengrocers  bakers  in our homes  in factories and farms  we were hemorrhaging out food. Supermarkets didn't even want to talk to me about how much food they were wasting. I'd been round the back. I'd seen bins full of food being locked and then trucked off to landfill sites  and I thought  surely there is something more sensible to do with food than waste it. One morning  when I was feeding my pigs  I noticed a particularly tasty looking sun dried tomato loaf that used to crop up from time to time. I grabbed hold of it  sat down  and ate my breakfast with my pigs.  Laughter  That was the first act of what I later learned to call freeganism  really an exhibition of the injustice of food waste  and the provision of the solution to food waste  which is simply to sit down and eat food  rather than throwing it away. That became  as it were  a way of confronting large businesses in the business of wasting food  and exposing  most importantly  to the public  that when we're talking about food being thrown away  we're not talking about rotten stuff  we're not talking about stuff that's beyond the pale. We're talking about good  fresh food that is being wasted on a colossal scale. Eventually  I set about writing my book  really to demonstrate the extent of this problem on a global scale. What this shows is a nation by nation breakdown of the likely level of food waste in each country in the world. Unfortunately  empirical data  good  hard stats  don't exist  and therefore to prove my point  I first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted. So I took the food supply of every single country and I compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country. That's based on diet intake surveys  it's based on levels of obesity  it's based on a range of factors that gives you an approximate guess as to how much food is actually going into people's mouths. That black line in the middle of that table is the likely level of consumption with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste. There will always be waste. I'm not that unrealistic that I think we can live in a waste free world. But that black line shows what a food supply should be in a country if they allow for a good  stable  secure  nutritional diet for every person in that country. Any dot above that line  and you'll quickly notice that that includes most countries in the world  represents unnecessary surplus  and is likely to reflect levels of waste in each country. As a country gets richer  it invests more and more in getting more and more surplus into its shops and restaurants  and as you can see  most European and North American countries fall between     and     percent of the nutritional requirements of their populations. So a country like America has twice as much food on its shop shelves and in its restaurants than is actually required to feed the American people. But the thing that really struck me  when I plotted all this data  and it was a lot of numbers  was that you can see how it levels off. Countries rapidly shoot towards that     mark  and then they level off  and they don't really go on rising as you might expect. So I decided to unpack that data a little bit further to see if that was true or false. And that's what I came up with. If you include not just the food that ends up in shops and restaurants  but also the food that people feed to livestock  the maize  the soy  the wheat  that humans could eat but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce increasing amounts of meat and dairy products  what you find is that most rich countries have between three and four times the amount of food that their population needs to feed itself. A country like America has four times the amount of food that it needs. When people talk about the need to increase global food production to feed those nine billion people that are expected on the planet by       I always think of these graphs. The fact is  we have an enormous buffer in rich countries between ourselves and hunger. We've never had such gargantuan surpluses before. In many ways  this is a great success story of human civilization  of the agricultural surpluses that we set out to achieve        years ago. It is a success story. It has been a success story. But what we have to recognize now is that we are reaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear  and when we chop down forests  as we are every day  to grow more and more food  when we extract water from depleting water reserves  when we emit fossil fuel emissions in the quest to grow more and more food  and then we throw away so much of it  we have to think about what we can start saving. And yesterday  I went to one of the local supermarkets that I often visit to inspect  if you like  what they're throwing away. I found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst all the fruit and vegetables and everything else that was in there. And I thought  well this could serve as a symbol for today. So I want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that I found in the bin represent the global food supply  okay  We start out with nine. That's what's in fields around the world every single year. The first biscuit we're going to lose before we even leave the farm. That's a problem primarily associated with developing work agriculture  whether it's a lack of infrastructure  refrigeration  pasteurization  grain stores  even basic fruit crates  which means that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields. The next three biscuits are the foods that we decide to feed to livestock  the maize  the wheat and the soya. Unfortunately  our beasts are inefficient animals  and they turn two thirds of that into feces and heat  so we've lost those two  and we've only kept this one in meat and dairy products. Two more we're going to throw away directly into bins. This is what most of us think of when we think of food waste  what ends up in the garbage  what ends up in supermarket bins  what ends up in restaurant bins. We've lost another two  and we've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on. That is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources  especially when you think of the billion hungry people that exist already in the world. Having gone through the data  I then needed to demonstrate where that food ends up. Where does it end up  We're used to seeing the stuff on our plates  but what about all the stuff that goes missing in between  Supermarkets are an easy place to start. This is the result of my hobby  which is unofficial bin inspections.  Laughter  Strange you might think  but if we could rely on corporations to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores  we wouldn't need to go sneaking around the back  opening up bins and having a look at what's inside. But this is what you can see more or less on every street corner in Britain  in Europe  in North America. It represents a colossal waste of food  but what I discovered whilst I was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg. When you start going up the supply chain  you find where the real food waste is happening on a gargantuan scale. Can I have a show of hands if you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house  Who lives in a household where that crust    that slice at the first and last end of each loaf    who lives in a household where it does get eaten  Okay  most people  not everyone  but most people  and this is  I'm glad to say  what I see across the world  and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches with crusts on it   Laughter  I certainly haven't. So I kept on thinking  where do those crusts go   Laughter  This is the answer  unfortunately         slices of fresh bread coming out of this one single factory every single day  day fresh bread. In the same year that I visited this factory  I went to Pakistan  where people in      were going hungry as a result of a squeeze on global food supplies. We contribute to that squeeze by depositing food in bins here in Britain and elsewhere in the world. We take food off the market shelves that hungry people depend on. Go one step up  and you get to farmers  who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harvest because of cosmetic standards. This farmer  for example  has invested        pounds in growing spinach  not one leaf of which he harvested  because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it. Potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect  all going for pigs. Parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications  tomatoes in Tenerife  oranges in Florida  bananas in Ecuador  where I visited last year  all being discarded. This is one day's waste from one banana plantation in Ecuador. All being discarded  perfectly edible  because they're the wrong shape or size. If we do that to fruit and vegetables  you bet we can do it to animals too. Liver  lungs  heads  tails  kidneys  testicles  all of these things which are traditional  delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy go to waste. Offal consumption has halved in Britain and America in the last    years. As a result  this stuff gets fed to dogs at best  or is incinerated. This man  in Kashgar  Xinjiang province  in Western China  is serving up his national dish. It's called sheep's organs. It's delicious  it's nutritious  and as I learned when I went to Kashgar  it symbolizes their taboo against food waste. I was sitting in a roadside cafe. A chef came to talk to me  I finished my bowl  and halfway through the conversation  he stopped talking and he started frowning into my bowl. I thought   My goodness  what taboo have I broken  How have I insulted my host   He pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl  and he said   Clean.   Laughter  I thought   My God  you know  I go around the world telling people to stop wasting food. This guy has thrashed me at my own game.   Laughter  But it gave me faith. It gave me faith that we  the people  do have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources if we regard it as socially unacceptable to waste food on a colossal scale  if we make noise about it  tell corporations about it  tell governments we want to see an end to food waste  we do have the power to bring about that change. Fish     to    percent of European fish are discarded at sea  they don't even get landed. In our homes  we've lost touch with food. This is an experiment I did on three lettuces. Who keeps lettuces in their fridge  Most people. The one on the left was kept in a fridge for    days. The one in the middle  on my kitchen table. Not much difference. The one on the right I treated like cut flowers. It's a living organism  cut the slice off  stuck it in a vase of water  it was all right for another two weeks after this. Some food waste  as I said at the beginning  will inevitably arise  so the question is  what is the best thing to do with it  I answered that question when I was   . In fact  humans answered that question       years ago  We domesticated pigs to turn food waste back into food. And yet  in Europe  that practice has become illegal since      as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak. It's unscientific. It's unnecessary. If you cook food for pigs  just as if you cook food for humans  it is rendered safe. It's also a massive saving of resources. At the moment  Europe depends on importing millions of tons of soy from South America  where its production contributes to global warming  to deforestation  to biodiversity loss  to feed livestock here in Europe. At the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them. If we did that  and fed it to pigs  we would save that amount of carbon. If we feed our food waste which is the current government favorite way of getting rid of food waste  to anaerobic digestion  which turns food waste into gas to produce electricity  you save a paltry     kilograms of carbon dioxide per ton of food waste. It's much better to feed it to pigs. We knew that during the war.  Laughter  A silver lining  It has kicked off globally  the quest to tackle food waste. Feeding the       is an event I first organized in     . We fed       people all on food that otherwise would have been wasted. Since then  it's happened again in London  it's happening internationally  and across the country. It's a way of organizations coming together to celebrate food  to say the best thing to do with food is to eat and enjoy it  and to stop wasting it. For the sake of the planet we live on  for the sake of our children  for the sake of all the other organisms that share our planet with us  we are a terrestrial animal  and we depend on our land for food. At the moment  we are trashing our land to grow food that no one eats. Stop wasting food. Thank you very much.  Applause  Fifteen years ago  it was widely assumed that the vast majority of brain development takes place in the first few years of life. Back then     years ago  we didn't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and track development across the lifespan. In the past decade or so  mainly due to advances in brain imaging technology such as magnetic resonance imaging  or MRI  neuroscientists have started to look inside the living human brain of all ages  and to track changes in brain structure and brain function  so we use structural MRI if you'd like to take a snapshot  a photograph  at really high resolution of the inside of the living human brain  and we can ask questions like  how much gray matter does the brain contain  and how does that change with age  And we also use functional MRI  called fMRI  to take a video  a movie  of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something. So many labs around the world are involved in this kind of research  and we now have a really rich and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops  and this picture has radically changed the way we think about human brain development by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood  and instead  the brain continues to develop right throughout adolescence and into the '  s and '  s. So adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological  hormonal  physical changes of puberty and ends at the age at which an individual attains a stable  independent role in society. It can go on a long time.  Laughter  One of the brain regions that changes most dramatically during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex. So this is a model of the human brain  and this is prefrontal cortex  right at the front. Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area. It's proportionally much bigger in humans than in any other species  and it's involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions  things like decision making  planning  planning what you're going to do tomorrow or next week or next year  inhibiting inappropriate behavior  so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid. It's also involved in social interaction  understanding other people  and self awareness. So MRI studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development during the period of adolescence. So if you look at gray matter volume  for example  gray matter volume across age from age four to    years increases during childhood  which is what you can see on this graph. It peaks in early adolescence. The arrows indicate peak gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex. You can see that that peak happens a couple of years later in boys relative to girls  and that's probably because boys go through puberty a couple of years later than girls on average  and then during adolescence  there's a significant decline in gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex. Now that might sound bad  but actually this is a really important developmental process  because gray matter contains cell bodies and connections between cells  the synapses  and this decline in gray matter volume during prefrontal cortex is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning  the elimination of unwanted synapses. This is a really important process. It's partly dependent on the environment that the animal or the human is in  and the synapses that are being used are strengthened  and synapses that aren't being used in that particular environment are pruned away. You can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush. You prune away the weaker branches so that the remaining  important branches  can grow stronger  and this process  which effectively fine tunes brain tissue according to the species specific environment  is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions during the period of human adolescence. So a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes in the adolescent brain is using functional MRI to look at changes in brain activity across age. So I'll just give you an example from my lab. So in my lab  we're interested in the social brain  that is the network of brain regions that we use to understand other people and to interact with other people. So I like to show a photograph of a soccer game to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work. So this is a soccer game.  Laughter  Michael Owen has just missed a goal  and he's lying on the ground  and the first aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic and instinctive social emotional responses are  so within a split second of Michael Owen missing this goal  everyone is doing the same thing with their arms and the same thing with their face  even Michael Owen as he slides along the grass  is doing the same thing with his arms  and presumably has a similar facial expression  and the only people who don't are the guys in yellow at the back    Laughs    and I think they're on the wrong end of the stadium  and they're doing another social emotional response that we all instantly recognize  and that's the second aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates  how good we are at reading other people's behavior  their actions  their gestures  their facial expressions  in terms of their underlying emotions and mental states. So you don't have to ask any of these guys. You have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling and thinking at this precise moment in time. So that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab. So in my lab  we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan  we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people  their minds  their mental states  their emotions  and one of the findings that we've found several times now  as have other labs around the world  is part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex  which is shown in blue on the slide  and it's right in the middle of prefrontal cortex in the midline of your head. This region is more active in adolescents when they make these social decisions and think about other people than it is in adults  and this is actually a meta analysis of nine different studies in this area from labs around the world  and they all show the same thing  that activity in this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases during the period of adolescence. And we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach  a different cognitive strategy  to make social decisions  and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of behavioral task  and I'll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab. So imagine that you're the participant in one of our experiments. You come into the lab  you see this computerized task. In this task  you see a set of shelves. Now  there are objects on these shelves  on some of them  and you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set of shelves  and there are some objects that he can't see. They're occluded  from his point of view  with a kind of gray piece of wood. This is the same set of shelves from his point of view. Notice that there are only some objects that he can see  whereas there are many more objects that you can see. Now your task is to move objects around. The director  standing behind the set of shelves  is going to direct you to move objects around  but remember  he's not going to ask you to move objects that he can't see. This introduces a really interesting condition whereby there's a kind of conflict between your perspective and the director's perspective. So imagine he tells you to move the top truck left. There are three trucks there. You're going to instinctively go for the white truck  because that's the top truck from your perspective  but then you have to remember   Oh  he can't see that truck  so he must mean me to move the blue truck   which is the top truck from his perspective. Now believe it or not  normal  healthy  intelligent adults like you make errors about    percent of the time on that kind of trial. They move the white truck instead of the blue truck. So we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults  and we also have a control condition where there's no director and instead we give people a rule. We tell them  okay  we're going to do exactly the same thing but this time there's no director. Instead you've got to ignore objects with the dark gray background. You'll see that this is exactly the same condition  only in the no director condition they just have to remember to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule  whereas in the director condition  they have to remember to take into account the director's perspective in order to guide their ongoing behavior. Okay  so if I just show you the percentage errors in a large developmental study we did  this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood  and what you're going to see is the percentage errors in the adult group in both conditions  so the gray is the director condition  and you see that our intelligent adults are making errors about    percent of the time  whereas they make far fewer errors when there's no director present  when they just have to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background. Developmentally  these two conditions develop in exactly the same way. Between late childhood and mid adolescence  there's an improvement  in other words a reduction of errors  in both of these trials  in both of these conditions. But it's when you compare the last two groups  the mid adolescent group and the adult group where things get really interesting  because there  there is no continued improvement in the no director condition. In other words  everything you need to do in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid adolescence  whereas in contrast  if you look at the last two gray bars  there's still a significant improvement in the director condition between mid adolescence and adulthood  and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior  which is something  by the way  that we do in everyday life all the time  is still developing in mid to late adolescence. So if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you sometimes think they have problems taking other people's perspectives  you're right. They do. And this is why. So we sometimes laugh about teenagers. They're parodied  sometimes even demonized in the media for their kind of typical teenage behavior. They take risks  they're sometimes moody  they're very self conscious. I have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine who said that the thing he noticed most about his teenage daughters before and after puberty was their level of embarrassment in front of him. So  he said   Before puberty  if my two daughters were messing around in a shop  I'd say  'Hey  stop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song ' and instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing their favorite song. After puberty  that became the threat. The very notion of their dad singing in public was enough to make them behave. So people often ask   Well  is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon  Is it something we've invented recently in the West   And actually  the answer is probably not. There are lots of descriptions of adolescence in history that sound very similar to the descriptions we use today. So there's a famous quote by Shakespeare from  The Winter's Tale  where he describes adolescence as follows   I would there were no age between ten and three and twenty  or that youth would sleep out the rest  for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child  wronging the ancientry  stealing  fighting.   Laughter  He then goes on to say   Having said that  would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and two and twenty hunt in this weather    Laughter  So almost     years ago  Shakespeare was portraying adolescents in a very similar light to the light that we portray them in today  but today we try to understand their behavior in terms of the underlying changes that are going on in their brain. So for example  take risk taking. We know that adolescents have a tendency to take risks. They do. They take more risks than children or adults  and they are particularly prone to taking risks when they're with their friends. There's an important drive to become independent from one's parents and to impress one's friends in adolescence. But now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system  so I'm going to show you the limbic system in red in the slide behind me  and also on this brain. So the limbic system is right deep inside the brain  and it's involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things  including taking risks. It gives you the kick out of taking risks. And this region  the regions within the limbic system  have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk taking in adolescents compared with adults  and at the very same time  the prefrontal cortex  which you can see in blue in the slide here  which stops us taking excessive risks  is still very much in development in adolescents. So brain research has shown that the adolescent brain undergoes really quite profound development  and this has implications for education  for rehabilitation  and intervention. The environment  including teaching  can and does shape the developing adolescent brain  and yet it's only relatively recently that we have been routinely educating teenagers in the West. All four of my grandparents  for example  left school in their early adolescence. They had no choice. And that's still the case for many  many teenagers around the world today. Forty percent of teenagers don't have access to secondary school education. And yet  this is a period of life where the brain is particularly adaptable and malleable. It's a fantastic opportunity for learning and creativity. So what's sometimes seen as the problem with adolescents   heightened risk taking  poor impulse control  self consciousness   shouldn't be stigmatized. It actually reflects changes in the brain that provide an excellent opportunity for education and social development. Thank you.  Applause  It's time to start designing for our ears. Architects and designers tend to focus exclusively on these. They use these to design with and they design for them  which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look like this    loud crowd noise    and sound like this  shouting from a foot away to try and be heard by our dinner companion  or why we get on airplanes     flight attendant announcements     which cost     million pounds  with somebody talking through an old fashioned telephone handset on a cheap stereo system  making us jump out of our skins. We're designing environments that make us crazy.  Laughter  And it's not just our quality of life which suffers. It's our health  our social behavior  and our productivity as well. How does this work  Well  two ways. First of all  ambience. I have a whole TEDTalk about this. Sound affects us physiologically  psychologically  cognitively and behaviorally all the time. The sound around us is affecting us even though we're not conscious of it. There's a second way though  as well. That's interference. Communication requires sending and receiving  and I have another whole TEDTalk about the importance of conscious listening  but I can send as well as I like  and you can be brilliant conscious listeners. If the space I'm sending it in is not effective  that communication can't happen. Spaces tend to include noise and acoustics. A room like this has acoustics  this one very good acoustics. Many rooms are not so good. Let me give you some examples from a couple of areas which I think we all care about  health and education. in a hospital  I was asking myself  how does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this  Hospital sound is getting worse all the time. Noise levels in hospitals have doubled in the last few years  and it affects not just the patients but also the people working there. I think we would like for dispensing errors to be zero  wouldn't we  And yet  as noise levels go up  so do the errors in dispensing made by the staff in hospitals. Most of all  though  it affects the patients  and that could be you  it could be me. Sleep is absolutely crucial for recovery. It's when we regenerate  when we rebuild ourselves  and with threatening noise like this going on  your body  even if you are able to sleep  your body is telling you   I'm under threat. This is dangerous.  And the quality of sleep is degraded  and so is our recovery. There are just huge benefits to come from designing for the ears in our health care. This is an area I intend to take on this year. Education. When I see a classroom that looks like this  can you imagine how this sounds  I am forced to ask myself a question. Now  that's a little unfair. Some of my best friends are architects.  Laughter  And they definitely do have ears. But I think sometimes they don't use them when they're designing buildings. Here's a case in point. This is a    million pound flagship academy school which was built quite recently in the U.K. and designed by one of Britain's top architects. Unfortunately  it was designed like a corporate headquarters  with a vast central atrium and classrooms leading off it with no back walls at all. The children couldn't hear their teachers. They had to go back in and spend         pounds putting the walls in. Let's stop this madness of open plan classrooms right now  please. It's not just these modern buildings which suffer. Old fashioned classrooms suffer too. A study in Florida just a few years ago found that if you're sitting where this photograph was taken in the classroom  row four  speech intelligibility is just    percent. Children are losing one word in two. Now that doesn't mean they only get half their education  but it does mean they have to work very hard to join the dots and understand what's going on. This is affected massively by reverberation time  how reverberant a room is. In a classroom with a reverberation time of  .  seconds  which is pretty common  this is what it sounds like. Not so good  is it  If you take that  .  seconds down to  .  seconds by installing acoustic treatments  sound absorbing materials and so forth  this is what you get. Voice  In language  infinitely many words can be written with a small set of letters. In arithmetic  infinitely many numbers can be composed from just a few digits with the help of the simple zero. Julian Treasure  What a difference. Now that education you would receive  and thanks to the British acoustician Adrian James for those simulations. The signal was the same  the background noise was the same. All that changed was the acoustics of the classroom in those two examples. If education can be likened to watering a garden  which is a fair metaphor  sadly  much of the water is evaporating before it reaches the flowers  especially for some groups  for example  those with hearing impairment. Now that's not just deaf children. That could be any child who's got a cold  glue ear  an ear infection  even hay fever. On a given day  one in eight children fall into that group  on any given day. Then you have children for whom English is a second language  or whatever they're being taught in is a second language. In the U.K.  that's more than    percent of the school population. And finally  after Susan Cain's wonderful TEDTalk in February  we know that introverts find it very difficult to relate when they're in a noisy environment doing group work. Add those up. That is a lot of children who are not receiving their education properly. It's not just the children who are affected  though. the average noise level in classrooms is    decibels. I have to really raise my voice to talk over    decibels of sound  and teachers are not just raising their voices. This chart maps the teacher's heart rate against the noise level. Noise goes up  heart rate goes up. That is not good for you. In fact     decibels is the very level at which this big survey of all the evidence on noise and health found that  that is the threshold for the danger of myocardial infarction. To you and me  that's a heart attack. It may not be pushing the boat out too far to suggest that many teachers are losing significant life expectancy by teaching in environments like that day after day. What does it cost to treat a classroom down to that  .  second reverberation time  Two and a half thousand pounds. And the Essex study which has just been done in the U.K.  which incidentally showed that when you do this  you do not just make a room that's suitable for hearing impaired children  you make a room where behavior improves  and results improve significantly  this found that sending a child out of area to a school that does have such a room  if you don't have one  costs        pounds a year. I think the economics are pretty clear on this. I'm glad that debate is happening on this. I just moderated a major conference in London a few weeks ago called Sound Education  which brought together top acousticians  government people  teachers  and so forth. We're at last starting to debate this issue  and the benefits that are available for designing for the ears in education  unbelievable. Out of that conference  incidentally  also came a free app which is designed to help children study if they're having to work at home  for example  in a noisy kitchen. And that's free out of that conference. Let's broaden the perspective a little bit and look at cities. We have urban planners. Where are the urban sound planners  I don't know of one in the world  and the opportunity is there to transform our experience in our cities. The World Health Organization estimates that a quarter of Europe's population is having its sleep degraded by noise in cities. We can do better than that. And in our offices  we spend a lot of time at work. Where are the office sound planners  People who say  don't sit that team next to this team  because they like noise and they need quiet. Or who say  don't spend all your budget on a huge screen in the conference room  and then place one tiny microphone in the middle of a table for    people.  Laughter  If you can hear me  you can understand me without seeing me. If you can see me without hearing me  that does not work. So office sound is a huge area  and incidentally  noise in offices has been shown to make people less helpful  less enjoy their teamwork  and less productive at work. Finally  we have homes. We use interior designers. Where are the interior sound designers  Hey  let's all be interior sound designers  take on listening to our rooms and designing sound that's effective and appropriate. My friend Richard Mazuch  an architect in London  coined the phrase  invisible architecture.  I love that phrase. It's about designing  not appearance  but experience  so that we have spaces that sound as good as they look  that are fit for purpose  that improve our quality of life  our health and well being  our social behavior and our productivity. It's time to start designing for the ears. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  I've always written primarily about architecture  about buildings  and writing about architecture is based on certain assumptions. An architect designs a building  and it becomes a place  or many architects design many buildings  and it becomes a city  and regardless of this complicated mix of forces of politics and culture and economics that shapes these places  at the end of the day  you can go and you can visit them. You can walk around them. You can smell them. You can get a feel for them. You can experience their sense of place. But what was striking to me over the last several years was that less and less was I going out into the world  and more and more  I was sitting in front of my computer screen. And especially since about       when I got an iPhone  I was not only sitting in front of my screen all day  but I was also getting up at the end of the day and looking at this little screen that I carried in my pocket. And what was surprising to me was how quickly my relationship to the physical world had changed. In this very short period of time  you know  whether you call it the last    years or so of being online  or the last  you know  four or five years of being online all the time  our relationship to our surroundings had changed in that our attention is constantly divided. You know  we're both looking inside the screens and we're looking out in the world around us. And what was even more striking to me  and what I really got hung up on  was that the world inside the screen seemed to have no physical reality of its own. If you went and looked for images of the Internet  this was all that you found  this famous image by Opte of the Internet as the kind of Milky Way  this infinite expanse where we don't seem to be anywhere on it. We can never seem to grasp it in its totality. It's always reminded me of the Apollo image of the Earth  the blue marble picture  and it's similarly meant to suggest  I think  that we can't really understand it as a whole. We're always sort of small in the face of its expanse. So if there was this world and this screen  and if there was the physical world around me  I couldn't ever get them together in the same place. And then this happened. My Internet broke one day  as it occasionally does  and the cable guy came to fix it  and he started with the dusty clump of cables behind the couch  and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard  and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall. And then he saw a squirrel running along the wire  and he said   There's your problem. A squirrel is chewing on your Internet.   Laughter  And this seemed astounding. The Internet is a transcendent idea. It's a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions. It was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on.  Laughter  But that in fact seemed to be the case. A squirrel had in fact chewed on my Internet.  Laughter  And then I got this image in my head of what would happen if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it. Where would it go  Was the Internet actually a place that you could visit  Could I go there  Who would I meet  You know  was there something actually out there  And the answer  by all accounts  was no. This was the Internet  this black box with a red light on it  as represented in the sitcom  The IT Crowd.  Normally it lives on the top of Big Ben  because that's where you get the best reception  but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation. The elders of the Internet were willing to part with it for a short while  and she looks at it and she says   This is the Internet  The whole Internet  Is it heavy   They say   Of course not  the Internet doesn't weigh anything.  And I was embarrassed. I was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for. The Internet was that amorphous blob  or it was a silly black box with a blinking red light on it. It wasn't a real world out there. But  in fact  it is. There is a real world of the Internet out there  and that's what I spent about two years visiting  these places of the Internet. I was in large data centers that use as much power as the cities in which they sit  and I visited places like this     Hudson Street in New York  which is one of the buildings in the world  one of a very short list of buildings  about a dozen buildings  where more networks of the Internet connect to each other than anywhere else. And that connection is an unequivocally physical process. It's about the router of one network  a Facebook or a Google or a B.T. or a Comcast or a Time Warner  whatever it is  connecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up into the ceiling and down into the router of another network  and that's unequivocally physical  and it's surprisingly intimate. A building like    Hudson  and a dozen or so others  has    times more networks connecting within it than the next tier of buildings. There's a very short list of these places. And    Hudson in particular is interesting because it's home to about a half a dozen very important networks  which are the networks which serve the undersea cables that travel underneath the ocean that connect Europe and America and connect all of us. And it's those cables in particular that I want to focus on. If the Internet is a global phenomenon  if we live in a global village  it's because there are cables underneath the ocean  cables like this. And in this dimension  they are incredibly small. You can you hold them in your hand. They're like a garden hose. But in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive  as expansive as you can imagine. They stretch across the ocean. They're three or five or eight thousand miles in length  and if the material science and the computational technology is incredibly complicated  the basic physical process is shockingly simple. Light goes in on one end of the ocean and comes out on the other  and it usually comes from a building called a landing station that's often tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood  and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor that look kind of like bluefin tuna  and every    miles they amplify the signal  and since the rate of transmission is incredibly fast  the basic unit is a    gigabit per second wavelength of light  maybe a thousand times your own connection  or capable of carrying        video streams  but not only that  but you'll put not just one wavelength of light through one of the fibers  but you'll put maybe    or    or    different wavelengths or colors of light through a single fiber  and then you'll have maybe eight fibers in a cable  four going in each direction. And they're tiny. They're the thickness of a hair. And then they connect to the continent somewhere. They connect in a manhole like this. Literally  this is where the       mile cable plugs in. This is in Halifax  a cable that stretches from Halifax to Ireland. And the landscape is changing. Three years ago  when I started thinking about this  there was one cable down the Western coast of Africa  represented in this map by Steve Song as that thin black line. Now there are six cables and more coming  three down each coast. Because once a country gets plugged in by one cable  they realize that it's not enough. If they're going to build an industry around it  they need to know that their connection isn't tenuous but permanent  because if a cable breaks  you have to send a ship out into the water  throw a grappling hook over the side  pick it up  find the other end  and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over. It's an intensely  intensely physical process. So this is my friend Simon Cooper  who until very recently worked for Tata Communications  the communications wing of Tata  the big Indian industrial conglomerate. And I've never met him. We've only communicated via this telepresence system  which always makes me think of him as the man inside the Internet.  Laughter  And he is English. The undersea cable industry is dominated by Englishmen  and they all seem to be   . with the boom about    years ago. And Tata had gotten its start as a communications business when they bought two cables  one across the Atlantic and one across the Pacific  and proceeded to add pieces onto them  until they had built a belt around the world  which means they will send your bits to the East or the West. They have    this is literally a beam of light around the world  and if a cable breaks in the Pacific  it'll send it around the other direction. And then having done that  they started to look for places to wire next. They looked for the unwired places  and that's meant North and South  primarily these cables to Africa. But what amazes me is Simon's incredible geographic imagination. He thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness. And I was particularly interested because I wanted to see one of these cables being built. See  you know  all the time online we experience these fleeting moments of connection  these sort of brief adjacencies  a tweet or a Facebook post or an email  and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that. It seemed like there was a moment when the continent was being plugged in  and I wanted to see that. And Simon was working on a new cable  WACS  the West Africa Cable System  that stretched from Lisbon down the west coast of Africa  to Cote d'Ivoire  to Ghana  to Nigeria  to Cameroon. And he said there was coming soon  depending on the weather  but he'd let me know when  and so with about four days notice  he said to go to this beach south of Lisbon  and a little after    this guy will walk out of the water.  Laughter  And he'll be carrying a green nylon line  a lightweight line  called a messenger line  and that was the first link between sea and land  this link that would then be leveraged into this       mile path of light. Then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this specialized cable landing ship  and it was floated on these buoys until it was in the right place. Then you can see the English engineers looking on. And then  once it was in the right place  he got back in the water holding a big knife  and he cut each buoy off  and the buoy popped up into the air  and the cable dropped to the sea floor  and he did that all the way out to the ship  and when he got there  they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie  and then he jumped back in  and he swam back to shore  and then he lit a cigarette.  Laughter  And then once that cable was on shore  they began to prepare to connect it to the other side  for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station. And first they got it with a hacksaw  and then they start sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a    sort of working like chefs  and then finally they're working like jewelers to get these hair thin fibers to line up with the cable that had come down  and with this hole punch machine they fuse it together. And when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw  you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud. It starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing. And what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology  as much as this is an incredibly new thing  the physical process itself has been around for a long time  and the culture is the same. You see the local laborers. You see the English engineer giving directions in the background. And more importantly  the places are the same. These cables still connect these classic port cities  places like Lisbon  Mombasa  Mumbai  Singapore  New York. And then the process on shore takes around three or four days  and then  when it's done  they put the manhole cover back on top  and they push the sand over that  and we all forget about it. And it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud  but every time we put something on the cloud  we give up some responsibility for it. We are less connected to it. We let other people worry about it. And that doesn't seem right. There's a great Neal Stephenson line where he says that wired people should know something about wires. And we should know  I think  we should know where our Internet comes from  and we should know what it is that physically  physically connects us all. Thank you.  Applause  Thanks.  Applause  I want to talk to you today about a difficult topic that is close to me  and closer than you might realize to you. I came to the UK    years ago  as an asylum seeker. I was   . I was forced to leave the Democratic Republic of the Congo  my home  where I was a student activist. I would love my children to be able to meet my family in the Congo. But I want to tell you what the Congo has got to do with you. But first of all  I want you to do me a favor. Can you all please reach into your pockets and take out your mobile phone  Feel that familiar weight ... how naturally your finger slides towards the buttons. Can you imagine your world without it  It connects us to our loved ones  our family  friends and colleagues  at home and overseas. It is a symbol of an interconnected world. But what you hold in your hand leaves a bloody trail  and it all boils down to a mineral  tantalum  mined in the Congo as coltan. It is an anticorrosive heat conductor. It stores energy in our mobile phones  PlayStations and laptops. It is used in aerospace and medical equipment as an alloy. It is so powerful that we only need tiny amounts. It would be great if the story ended there. Unfortunately  what you hold in your hand has not only enabled incredible technological development and industrial expansion  but it has also contributed to unimaginable human suffering. Since       over five million people have died in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Countless women  men and children have been raped  tortured or enslaved. Rape is used as a weapon of war  instilling fear and depopulating whole areas. The quest for extracting this mineral has not only aided  but it has fueled the ongoing war in the Congo. But don't throw away your phones yet. Thirty thousand children are enlisted and are made to fight in armed groups. The Congo consistently scores dreadfully in global health and poverty rankings. But remarkably  the UN Environmental Programme has estimated the wealth of the country to be over    trillion dollars. The state regulated mining industry has collapsed  and control over mines has splintered. Coltan is easily controlled by armed groups. One well known illicit trade route is that across the border to Rwanda  where Congolese tantalum is disguised as Rwandan. But don't throw away your phones yet  because the incredible irony is that the technology that has placed such unsustainable  devastating demands on the Congo is the same technology that has brought this situation to our attention. We only know so much about the situation in the Congo and in the mines because of the kind of communication the mobile phone allows. As with the Arab Spring  during the recent elections in the Congo  voters were able to send text messages of local polling stations to the headquarters in the capital  Kinshasa. And in the wake of the result  the diaspora has joined with the Carter Center  the Catholic Church and other observers  to draw attention to the undemocratic result. The mobile phone has given people around the world an important tool towards gaining their political freedom. It has truly revolutionized the way we communicate on the planet. It has allowed momentous political change to take place. So  we are faced with a paradox. The mobile phone is an instrument of freedom and an instrument of oppression. TED has always celebrated what technology can do for us  technology in its finished form. It is time to be asking questions about technology. Where does it come from  Who makes it  And for what  Here  I am speaking directly to you  the TED community  and to all those who might be watching on a screen  on your phone  across the world  in the Congo. All the technology is in place for us to communicate  and all the technology is in place to communicate this. At the moment  there is no clear fair trade solution. But there has been a huge amount of progress. The US has recently passed legislation to target bribery and misconduct in the Congo. Recent UK legislation could be used in the same way. In February  Nokia unveiled its new policy on sourcing minerals in the Congo  and there is a petition to Apple to make a conflict free iPhone. There are campaigns spreading across university campuses to make their colleges conflict free. But we're not there yet. We need to continue mounting pressure on phone companies to change their sourcing processes. When I first came to the UK     years ago  I was homesick. I missed my family and the friends I left behind. Communication was extremely difficult. Sending and receiving letters took months    if you were lucky. Often  they never arrived. Even if I could have afforded the phone bills home  like most people in the Congo  my parents did not own a phone line. Today  my two sons    David and Daniel  can talk to my parents and get to know them. Why should we allow such a wonderful  brilliant and necessary product to be the cause of unnecessary suffering for human beings  We demand fair trade food and fair trade clothes. It is time to demand fair trade phones. This is an idea worth spreading. Thank you. You know  we wake up in the morning  you get dressed  put on your shoes  you head out into the world. You plan on coming back  getting undressed  going to bed  waking up  doing it again  and that anticipation  that rhythm  helps give us a structure to how we organize ourselves and our lives  and gives it a measure of predictability. Living in New York City  as I do  it's almost as if  with so many people doing so many things at the same time in such close quarters  it's almost like life is dealing you extra hands out of that deck. You're never  there's just  juxtapositions are possible that just aren't  you don't think they're going to happen. And you never think you're going to be the guy who's walking down the street and  because you choose to go down one side or the other  the rest of your life is changed forever. And one night  I'm riding the uptown local train. I get on. I tend to be a little bit vigilant when I get on the subway. I'm not one of the people zoning out with headphones or a book. And I get on the car  and I look  and I notice this couple  college aged  student looking kids  a guy and a girl  and they're sitting next to each other  and she's got her leg draped over his knee  and they're doing    they have this little contraption  and they're tying these knots  and they're doing it with one hand  they're doing it left handed and right handed very quickly  and then she'll hand the thing to him and he'll do it. I've never seen anything like this. It's almost like they're practicing magic tricks. And at the next stop  a guy gets on the car  and he has this sort of visiting professor look to him. He's got the overstuffed leather satchel and the rectangular file case and a laptop bag and the tweed jacket with the leather patches  and    Laughter    he looks at them  and then in a blink of an eye  he kneels down in front of them  and he starts to say   You know  listen  here's how you can do it. Look  if you do this      and he takes the laces out of their hand  and instantly  he starts tying these knots  and even better than they were doing it  remarkably. And it turns out they are medical students on their way to a lecture about the latest suturing techniques  and he's the guy giving the lecture. So he starts to tell them  and he's like   No  this is very important here. You know  when you're needing these knots  it's going to be  you know  everything's going to be happening at the same time  it's going to be    you're going to have all this information coming at you  there's going to be organs getting in the way  it's going to be slippery  and it's just very important that you be able to do these beyond second nature  each hand  left hand  right hand  you have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers.  And at that moment  when I heard that  I just got catapulted out of the subway car into a night when I had been getting a ride in an ambulance from the sidewalk where I had been stabbed to the trauma room of St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan  and what had happened was a gang had come in from Brooklyn. As part of an initiation for three of their members  they had to kill somebody  and I happened to be the guy walking down Bleecker Street that night  and they jumped on me without a word. One of the very lucky things  when I was at Notre Dame  I was on the boxing team  so I put my hands up right away  instinctively. The guy on the right had a knife with a    inch blade  and he went in under my elbow  and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava. If you know anything about anatomy  that's not a good thing to get cut  and everything  of course  on the way up  and then   I still had my hands up   he pulled it out and went for my neck  and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck  and I got one straight right punch and knocked the middle guy out. The other guy was still working on me  collapsing my other lung  and I managed to  by hitting that guy  to get a minute. I ran down the street and collapsed  and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk and let the trauma room know they had an incoming. And one of the side effects of having major massive blood loss is you get tunnel vision  so I remember being on the stretcher and having a little nickel sized cone of vision  and I was moving my head around and we got to St. Vincent's  and we're racing down this hallway  and I see the lights going  and it's a peculiar effect of memories like that. They don't really go to the usual place that memories go. They kind of have this vault where they're stored in high def  and George Lucas did all the sound effects.  Laughter  So sometimes  remembering them  it's like  it's not like any other kind of memories. And I get into the trauma room  and they're waiting for me  and the lights are there  and I'd been able to breathe a little more now  because the blood has left  had been filling up my lungs and I was having a very hard time breathing  but now it's kind of gone into the stretcher. And I said   Is there anything I can do to help   and    Laughter    the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh  and I'm turning my head trying to see everybody  and I had this weird memory of being in college and raising  raising money for the flood victims of Bangladesh  and then I look over and my anesthesiologist is clamping the mask on me  and I think   He looks Bangladeshi      Laughter    and I just have those two facts  and I just think   This could work somehow.   Laughter  And then I go out  and they work on me for the rest of the night  and I needed about    units of blood to keep me there while they did their work  and the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines  my cecum  organs I didn't know that I had  and he later told me one of the last things he did while he was in there was to remove my appendix for me  which I thought was great  you know  just a little tidy thing there at the end.  Laughter  And I came to in the morning. Out of anesthetic  he had let them know that he wanted to be there  and he had given me about a two percent chance of living. So he was there when I woke up  and it was  waking up was like breaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain. It was that enveloping  and there was only one spot that didn't hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt  and it was my instep  and he was holding the arch of my foot and rubbing the instep with his thumb. And I looked up  and he's like   Good to see you   and I was trying to remember what had happened and trying to get my head around everything  and the pain was just overwhelming  and he said   You know  we didn't cut your hair. I thought you might have gotten strength from your hair like Samson  and you're going to need all the strength you can get.  And in those days  my hair was down to my waist  I drove a motorcycle  I was unmarried  I owned a bar  so those were different times.  Laughter  But I had three days of life support  and everybody was expecting  due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do that I wasn't going to make it  so it was three days of everybody was either waiting for me to die or poop  and    Laughter    when I finally pooped  then that somehow  surgically speaking  that's like you crossed some good line  and  um    Laughter    on that day  the surgeon came in and whipped the sheet off of me. He had three or four friends with him  and he does that  and they all look  and there was no infection  and they bend over me and they're poking and prodding  and they're like   There's no hematomas  blah blah  look at the color   and they're talking amongst themselves and I'm  like  this restored automobile that he's just going   Yeah  I did that.   Laughter  And it was just  it was amazing  because these guys are high fiving him over how good I turned out  you know   Laughter  And it's my zipper  and I've still got the staples in and everything. And later on  when I got out and the flashbacks and the nightmares were giving me a hard time  I went back to him and I was sort of asking him  you know  what am I gonna do  And I think  kind of  as a surgeon  he basically said   Kid  I saved your life. Like  now you can do whatever you want  like  you gotta get on with that. It's like I gave you a new car and you're complaining about not finding parking. Like  just  go out  and  you know  do your best. But you're alive. That's what it's about.  And then I hear   Bing bong   and the subway doors are closing  and my stop is next  and I look at these kids  and I go  I think to myself   I'm going to lift my shirt up and show them      Laughter    and then I think   No  this is the New York City subway  that's going to lead to other things.   Laughter  And so I just think  they got their lecture to go to. I step off  I'm standing on the platform  and I feel my index finger in the first scar that I ever got  from my umbilical cord  and then around that  is traced the last scar that I got from my surgeon  and I think that  that chance encounter with those kids on the street with their knives led me to my surgical team  and their training and their skill and  always  a little bit of luck pushed back against chaos. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Very lucky to be here. Thank you.  Applause  So if someone asked you for the three words that would sum up your reputation  what would you say  How would people describe your judgment  your knowledge  your behaviors  in different situations  Today I'd like to explore with you why the answer to this question will become profoundly important in an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset. I'd like to start by introducing you to someone whose life has been changed by a marketplace fueled by reputation. Sebastian Sandys has been a bed and breakfast host on Airbnb since     . I caught up with him recently  where  over the course of several cups of tea  he told me how hosting guests from all over the world has enriched his life. More than    people have come to stay in the   th century watchhouse he lives in with his cat  Squeak. Now  I mention Squeak because Sebastian's first guest happened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen  and she promised that she would refrain from leaving a bad review on one condition  he got a cat. And so Sebastian bought Squeak to protect his reputation. Now  as many of you know  Airbnb is a peer to peer marketplace that matches people who have space to rent with people who are looking for a place to stay in over     countries. The places being rented out are things that you might expect  like spare rooms and holiday homes  but part of the magic is the unique places that you can now access  treehouses  teepees  airplane hangars  igloos. If you don't like the hotel  there's a castle down the road that you can rent for       dollars a night. It's a fantastic example of how technology is creating a market for things that never had a marketplace before. Now let me show you these heat maps of Paris to see how insanely fast it's growing. This image here is from     . The pink dots represent host properties. Even four years ago  letting strangers stay in your home seemed like a crazy idea. Now the same view in     . And now      . There is an Airbnb host on almost every main street in Paris. Now  what's happening here is people are realizing the power of technology to unlock the idling capacity and value of all kinds of assets  from skills to spaces to material possessions  in ways and on a scale never possible before. It's an economy and culture called collaborative consumption  and  through it  people like Sebastian are becoming micro entrepreneurs. They're empowered to make money and save money from their existing assets. But the real magic and the secret source behind collaborative consumption marketplaces like Airbnb isn't the inventory or the money. It's using the power of technology to build trust between strangers. This side of Airbnb really hit home to Sebastian last summer during the London riots. He woke up around    and he checked his email and he saw a bunch of messages all asking him if he was okay. Former guests from around the world had seen that the riots were happening just down the street  and wanted to check if he needed anything. Sebastian actually said to me  he said   Thirteen former guests contacted me before my own mother rang.   Laughter  Now  this little anecdote gets to the heart of why I'm really passionate about collaborative consumption  and why  after I finished my book  I decided I'm going to try and spread this into a global movement. Because at its core  it's about empowerment. It's about empowering people to make meaningful connections  connections that are enabling us to rediscover a humanness that we've lost somewhere along the way  by engaging in marketplaces like Airbnb  like Kickstarter  like Etsy  that are built on personal relationships versus empty transactions. Now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back to old market principles and collaborative behaviors that are hard wired in all of us. They're just being reinvented in ways that are relevant for the Facebook age. We're literally beginning to realize that we have wired our world to share  swap  rent  barter or trade just about anything. We're sharing our cars on WhipCar  our bikes on Spinlister  our offices on Loosecubes  our gardens on Landshare. We're lending and borrowing money from strangers on Zopa and Lending Club. We are trading lessons on everything from sushi making to coding on Skillshare  and we're even sharing our pets on DogVacay. Now welcome to the wonderful world of collaborative consumption that's enabling us to match wants with haves in more democratic ways. Now  collaborative consumption is creating the start of a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand  but it's also a part of a massive value shift underway  where instead of consuming to keep up with the Joneses  people are consuming to get to know the Joneses. But the key reason why it's taking off now so fast is because every new advancement of technology increases the efficiency and the social glue of trust to make sharing easier and easier. Now  I've looked at thousands of these marketplaces  and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients. Let me give you an example. Meet    year old Chris Mok  who has  I bet  the best job title here of SuperRabbit. Now  four years ago  Chris lost his job  unfortunately  as an art buyer at Macy's  and like so many people  he struggled to find a new one during the recession. And then he happened to stumble across a post about TaskRabbit. Now  the story behind TaskRabbit starts like so many great stories with a very cute dog by the name of Kobe. Now what happened was  in February       Leah and her husband were waiting for a cab to take them out for dinner  when Kobe came trotting up to them and he was salivating with saliva. They realized they'd run out of dog food. Kevin had to cancel the cab and trudge out in the snow. Now  later that evening  the two self confessed tech geeks starting talking about how cool it would be if some kind of eBay for errands existed. Six months later  Leah quit her job  and TaskRabbit was born. At the time  she didn't realize that she was actually hitting on a bigger idea she later called service networking. It's essentially about how we use our online relationships to get things done in the real world. Now the way TaskRabbit works is  people outsource the tasks that they want doing  name the price they're willing to pay  and then vetted Rabbits bid to run the errand. Yes  there's actually a four stage  rigorous interview process that's designed to find the people that would make great personal assistants and weed out the dodgy Rabbits. Now  there's over       Rabbits across the United States and       more on the waiting list. Now the tasks being posted are things that you might expect  like help with household chores or doing some supermarket runs. I actually learned the other day that    and a half thousand loads of laundry have been cleaned and folded through TaskRabbit. But I love that the number one task posted  over a hundred times a day  is something that many of us have felt the pain of doing  yes  assembling Ikea furniture.  Laughter   Applause  It's brilliant. Now  we may laugh  but Chris here is actually making up to       dollars a month running errands around his life. And    percent of this new labor force were previously unemployed or underemployed. I think TaskRabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption are like lemonade stands on steroids. They're just brilliant. Now  when you think about it  it's amazing  right  that over the past    years  we've evolved from trusting people online to share information to trusting to handing over our credit card information  and now we're entering the third trust wave  connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds of people powered marketplaces. I actually came across this fascinating study by the Pew Center this week that revealed that an active Facebook user is three times as likely as a non Internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy. Virtual trust will transform the way we trust one another face to face. Now  with all of my optimism  and I am an optimist  comes a healthy dose of caution  or rather  an urgent need to address some pressing  complex questions. How to ensure our digital identities reflect our real world identities  Do we want them to be the same  How do we mimic the way trust is built face to face online  How do we stop people who've behaved badly in one community doing so under a different guise  In a similar way that companies often use some kind of credit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan  or the rate of a mortgage  marketplaces that depend on transactions between relative strangers need some kind of device to let you know that Sebastian and Chris are good eggs  and that device is reputation. Reputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you. Let's just take a look at Chris. You can see that over     people have given him an average rating over  .   out of  . There are over    pages of reviews of his work describing him as super friendly and fast  and he's reached level     the highest level  making him a SuperRabbit. Now    Laughter     I love that word  SuperRabbit. And interestingly  what Chris has noted is that as his reputation has gone up  so has his chances of winning a bid and how much he can charge. In other words  for SuperRabbits  reputation has a real world value. Now  I know what you might be thinking. Well  this isn't anything new. Just think of power sellers on eBay or star ratings on Amazon. The difference today is that  with every trade we make  comment we leave  person we flag  badge we earn  we leave a reputation trail of how well we can and can't be trusted. And it's not just the breadth but the volume of reputation data out there that is staggering. Just consider this  Five million nights have been booked on Airbnb in the past six months alone.    million rides have been shared on Carpooling.com. This year  two billion dollars worth of loans will go through peer to peer lending platforms. This adds up to millions of pieces of reputation data on how well we behave or misbehave. Now  capturing and correlating the trails of information that we leave in different places is a massive challenge  but one we're being asked to figure out. What the likes of Sebastian are starting to rightfully ask is  shouldn't they own their reputation data  Shouldn't the reputation that he's personally invested on building on Airbnb mean that it should travel with him from one community to another  What I mean by this is  say he started selling second hand books on Amazon. Why should he have to start from scratch  It's a bit like when I moved from New York to Sydney. It was ridiculous. I couldn't get a mobile phone plan because my credit history didn't travel with me. I was essentially a ghost in the system. Now I'm not suggesting that the next stage of the reputation economy is about adding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score. People's lives are too complex  and who wants to do that  I also want to be clear that this isn't about adding up tweets and likes and friends in a clout like fashion. Those guys are measuring influence  not behaviors that indicate our trustworthiness. But the most important thing that we have to keep in mind is that reputation is largely contextual. Just because Sebastian is a wonderful host does not mean that he can assemble Ikea furniture. The big challenge is figuring out what data makes sense to pull  because the future's going to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation  not a single algorithm. It's only a matter of time before we'll be able to perform a Facebook  or Google like search and see a complete picture of someone's behaviors in different contexts over time. I envision a realtime stream of who has trusted you  when  where and why  your reliability on TaskRabbit  your cleanliness as a guest on Airbnb  the knowledge that you display on Quora or  unclear   they'll all live together in one place  and this will live in some kind of reputation dashboard that will paint a picture of your reputation capital. Now this is a concept that I'm currently researching and writing my next book on  and currently define as the worth of your reputation  your intentions  capabilities and values across communities and marketplaces. This isn't some far off frontier. There are actually a wave of startups like Connect.Me and Legit and TrustCloud that are figuring out how you can aggregate  monitor and use your online reputation. Now  I realize that this concept may sound a little Big Brother to some of you  and yes  there are some enormous transparency and privacy issues to solve  but ultimately  if we can collect our personal reputation  we can actually control it more  and extract the immense value that will flow from it. Also  more so than our credit history  we can actually shape our reputation. Just think of Sebastian and how he bought the cat to influence his. Now privacy issues aside  the other really interesting issue I'm looking at is how do we empower digital ghosts  people  who  for whatever reason  are not active online  but are some of the most trustworthy people in the world  How do we take their contributions to their jobs  their communities and their families  and convert that value into reputation capital  Ultimately  when we get it right  reputation capital could create a massive positive disruption in who has power  trust and influence. A three digit score  your traditional credit history  that only    percent of us actually know what it is  will no longer be the determining factor in how much things cost  what we can access  and  in many instances  limit what we can do in the world. Indeed  reputation is a currency that I believe will become more powerful than our credit history in the   st century. Reputation will be the currency that says that you can trust me. Now the interesting thing is  reputation is the socioeconomic lubricant that makes collaborative consumption work and scale  but the sources it will be generated from  and its applications  are far bigger than this space alone. Let me give you one example from the world of recruiting  where reputation data will make the r sum  seem like an archaic relic of the past. Four years ago  tech bloggers and entrepreneurs Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood  decided to start something called Stack Overflow. Now  Stack Overflow is basically a platform where experienced programmers can ask other good programmers highly detailed technical questions on things like tiny pixels and chrome extensions. This site receives five and a half thousand questions a day  and    percent of these receive accurate answers. Now users earn reputation in a whole range of ways  but it's basically by convincing their peers they know what they're talking about. Now a few months after this site launched  the founders heard about something interesting  and it actually didn't surprise them. What they heard was that users were putting their reputation scores on the top of their r sum s  and that recruiters were searching the platform to find people with unique talents. Now thousands of programmers today are finding better jobs this way  because Stack Overflow and the reputation dashboards provide a priceless window into how someone really behaves  and what their peers think of them. But the bigger principle of what's happening behind Stack Overflow  I think  is incredibly exciting. People are starting to realize that the reputation they generate in one place has value beyond the environments from which it was built. You know  it's very interesting. When you talk to super users  whether that's SuperRabbits or super people on Stack Overflow  or Uberhosts  they all talk about how having a high reputation unlocks a sense of their own power. On Stack Overflow  it creates a level playing field  enabling the people with the real talent to rise to the top. On Airbnb  the people often become more important than the spaces. On TaskRabbit  it gives people control of their economic activity. Now at the end of my tea with Sebastian  he told me how  on a bad  rainy day  when he hasn't had a customer in his bookstore  he thinks of all the people around the world who've said something wonderful about him  and what that says about him as a person. He's turning    this year  and he's convinced that the rich tapestry of reputation he's built on Airbnb will lead him to doing something interesting with the rest of his life. You know  there are only a few windows in history where the opportunity exists to reinvent part of how our socioeconomic system works. We're living through one of those moments. I believe that we are at the start of a collaborative revolution that will be as significant as the Industrial Revolution. In the   th century  the invention of traditional credit transformed our consumer system  and in many ways controlled who had access to what. In the   st century  new trust networks  and the reputation capital they generate  will reinvent the way we think about wealth  markets  power and personal identity  in ways we can't yet even imagine. Thank you very much.  Applause  As it turns out  when tens of millions of people are unemployed or underemployed  there's a fair amount of interest in what technology might be doing to the labor force. And as I look at the conversation  it strikes me that it's focused on exactly the right topic  and at the same time  it's missing the point entirely. The topic that it's focused on  the question is whether or not all these digital technologies are affecting people's ability to earn a living  or  to say it a little bit different way  are the droids taking our jobs  And there's some evidence that they are. The Great Recession ended when American GDP resumed its kind of slow  steady march upward  and some other economic indicators also started to rebound  and they got kind of healthy kind of quickly. Corporate profits are quite high  in fact  if you include bank profits  they're higher than they've ever been. And business investment in gear    in equipment and hardware and software    is at an all time high. So the businesses are getting out their checkbooks. What they're not really doing is hiring. So this red line is the employment to population ratio  in other words  the percentage of working age people in America who have work. And we see that it cratered during the Great Recession  and it hasn't started to bounce back at all. But the story is not just a recession story. The decade that we've just been through had relatively anemic job growth all throughout  especially when we compare it to other decades  and the     s are the only time we have on record where there were fewer people working at the end of the decade than at the beginning. This is not what you want to see. When you graph the number of potential employees versus the number of jobs in the country  you see the gap gets bigger and bigger over time  and then  during the Great Recession  it opened up in a huge way. I did some quick calculations. I took the last    years of GDP growth and the last    years of labor productivity growth and used those in a fairly straightforward way to try to project how many jobs the economy was going to need to keep growing  and this is the line that I came up with. Is that good or bad  This is the government's projection for the working age population going forward. So if these predictions are accurate  that gap is not going to close. The problem is  I don't think these projections are accurate. In particular  I think my projection is way too optimistic  because when I did it  I was assuming that the future was kind of going to look like the past  with labor productivity growth  and that's actually not what I believe. Because when I look around  I think that we ain't seen nothing yet when it comes to technology's impact on the labor force. Just in the past couple years  we've seen digital tools display skills and abilities that they never  ever had before  and that kind of eat deeply into what we human beings do for a living. Let me give you a couple examples. Throughout all of history  if you wanted something translated from one language into another  you had to involve a human being. Now we have multi language  instantaneous  automatic translation services available for free via many of our devices  all the way down to smartphones. And if any of us have used these  we know that they're not perfect  but they're decent. Throughout all of history  if you wanted something written  a report or an article  you had to involve a person. Not anymore. This is an article that appeared in Forbes online a while back  about Apple's earnings. It was written by an algorithm. And it's not decent    it's perfect. A lot of people look at this and they say   OK  but those are very specific  narrow tasks  and most knowledge workers are actually generalists. And what they do is sit on top of a very large body of expertise and knowledge and they use that to react on the fly to kind of unpredictable demands  and that's very  very hard to automate.  One of the most impressive knowledge workers in recent memory is a guy named Ken Jennings. He won the quiz show  Jeopardy      times in a row. Took home three million dollars. That's Ken on the right  getting beat three to one by Watson  the Jeopardy playing supercomputer from IBM. So when we look at what technology can do to general knowledge workers  I start to think there might not be something so special about this idea of a generalist  particularly when we start doing things like hooking Siri up to Watson  and having technologies that can understand what we're saying and repeat speech back to us. Now  Siri is far from perfect  and we can make fun of her flaws  but we should also keep in mind that if technologies like Siri and Watson improve along a Moore's law trajectory  which they will  in six years  they're not going to be two times better or four times better  they'll be    times better than they are right now. So I start to think a lot of knowledge work is going to be affected by this. And digital technologies are not just impacting knowledge work  they're starting to flex their muscles in the physical world as well. I had the chance a little while back to ride in the Google autonomous car  which is as cool as it sounds. And I will vouch that it handled the stop and go traffic on US     very smoothly. There are about three and a half million people who drive trucks for a living in the United States  I think some of them are going to be affected by this technology. And right now  humanoid robots are still incredibly primitive. They can't do very much. But they're getting better quite quickly and DARPA  which is the investment arm of the Defense Department  is trying to accelerate their trajectory. So  in short  yeah  the droids are coming for our jobs. In the short term  we can stimulate job growth by encouraging entrepreneurship and by investing in infrastructure  because the robots today still aren't very good at fixing bridges. But in the not too long term  I think within the lifetimes of most of the people in this room  we're going to transition into an economy that is very productive  but that just doesn't need a lot of human workers. And managing that transition is going to be the greatest challenge that our society faces. Voltaire summarized why  he said   Work saves us from three great evils  boredom  vice and need.  But despite this challenge    personally  I'm still a huge digital optimist  and I am supremely confident that the digital technologies that we're developing now are going to take us into a Utopian future  not a dystopian future. And to explain why  I want to pose a ridiculously broad question. I want to ask  what have been the most important developments in human history  Now  I want to share some of the answers that I've gotten in response to this question. It's a wonderful question to ask and start an endless debate about  because some people are going to bring up systems of philosophy in both the West and the East that have changed how a lot of people think about the world. And then other people will say   No  actually  the big stories  the big developments are the founding of the world's major religions  which have changed civilizations and have changed and influenced how countless people are living their lives.  And then some other folk will say   Actually  what changes civilizations  what modifies them and what changes people's lives are empires  so the great developments in human history are stories of conquest and of war.  And then some cheery soul usually always pipes up and says   Hey  don't forget about plagues   There are some optimistic answers to this question  so some people will bring up the Age of Exploration and the opening up of the world. Others will talk about intellectual achievements in disciplines like math that have helped us get a better handle on the world  and other folk will talk about periods when there was a deep flourishing of the arts and sciences. So this debate will go on and on. It's an endless debate and there's no conclusive  single answer to it. But if you're a geek like me  you say   Well  what do the data say   And you start to do things like graph things that we might be interested in    the total worldwide population  for example  or some measure of social development or the state of advancement of a society. And you start to plot the data  because  by this approach  the big stories  the big developments in human history  are the ones that will bend these curves a lot. So when you do this and when you plot the data  you pretty quickly come to some weird conclusions. You conclude  actually  that none of these things have mattered very much. They haven't done a darn thing to the curves. There has been one story  one development in human history that bent the curve  bent it just about    degrees  and it is a technology story. The steam engine and the other associated technologies of the Industrial Revolution changed the world and influenced human history so much  that in the words of the historian Ian Morris   ... they made mockery out of all that had come before.  And they did this by infinitely multiplying the power of our muscles  overcoming the limitations of our muscles. Now  what we're in the middle of now is overcoming the limitations of our individual brains and infinitely multiplying our mental power. How can this not be as big a deal as overcoming the limitations of our muscles  So at the risk of repeating myself a little bit  when I look at what's going on with digital technology these days  we are not anywhere near through with this journey. And when I look at what is happening to our economies and our societies  my single conclusion is that we ain't seen nothing yet. The best days are really ahead. Let me give you a couple examples. Economies don't run on energy. They don't run on capital  they don't run on labor. Economies run on ideas. So the work of innovation  the work of coming up with new ideas  is some of the most powerful  most fundamental work that we can do in an economy. And this is kind of how we used to do innovation. We'd find a bunch of fairly similar looking people ... We'd take them out of elite institutions  we'd put them into other elite institutions and we'd wait for the innovation. Now    as a white guy who spent his whole career at MIT and Harvard  I've got no problem with this. But some other people do  and they've kind of crashed the party and loosened up the dress code of innovation. So here are the winners of a Topcoder programming challenge  and I assure you that nobody cares where these kids grew up  where they went to school  or what they look like. All anyone cares about is the quality of the work  the quality of the ideas. And over and over again  we see this happening in the technology facilitated world. The work of innovation is becoming more open  more inclusive  more transparent and more merit based  and that's going to continue no matter what MIT and Harvard think of it  and I couldn't be happier about that development. I hear once in a while   OK  I'll grant you that  but technology is still a tool for the rich world  and what's not happening  these digital tools are not improving the lives of people at the bottom of the pyramid.  And I want to say to that very clearly  nonsense. The bottom of the pyramid is benefiting hugely from technology. The economist Robert Jensen did this wonderful study a while back where he watched  in great detail  what happened to the fishing villages of Kerala  India  when they got mobile phones for the very first time. And when you write for the Quarterly Journal of Economics  you have to use very dry and very circumspect language. But when I read his paper  I kind of feel Jensen is trying to scream at us and say   Look  this was a big deal. Prices stabilized  so people could plan their economic lives. Waste was not reduced    it was eliminated. And the lives of both the buyers and the sellers in these villages measurably improved.  Now  what I don't think is that Jensen got extremely lucky and happened to land in the one set of villages where technology made things better. What happened instead is he very carefully documented what happens over and over again when technology comes for the first time to an environment and a community  the lives of people  the welfares of people  improve dramatically. So as I look around at all the evidence and I think about the room that we have ahead of us  I become a huge digital optimist and I start to think that this wonderful statement from the physicist Freeman Dyson is actually not hyperbole. This is an accurate assessment of what's going on. Our technologies are great gifts  and we  right now  have the great good fortune to be living at a time when digital technology is flourishing  when it is broadening and deepening and becoming more profound all around the world. So  yeah  the droids are taking our jobs  but focusing on that fact misses the point entirely. The point is that then we are freed up to do other things  and what we're going to do  I am very confident  what we're going to do is reduce poverty and drudgery and misery around the world. I'm very confident we're going to learn to live more lightly on the planet  and I am extremely confident that what we're going to do with our new digital tools is going to be so profound and so beneficial that it's going to make a mockery out of everything that came before. I'm going to leave the last word to a guy who had a front row seat for digital progress  our old friend Ken Jennings. I'm with him  I'm going to echo his words   I  for one  welcome our new computer overlords.  Thanks very much. Other people. Everyone is interested in other people. Everyone has relationships with other people  and they're interested in these relationships for a variety of reasons. Good relationships  bad relationships  annoying relationships  agnostic relationships  and what I'm going to do is focus on the central piece of an interaction that goes on in a relationship. So I'm going to take as inspiration the fact that we're all interested in interacting with other people  I'm going to completely strip it of all its complicating features  and I'm going to turn that object  that simplified object  into a scientific probe  and provide the early stages  embryonic stages of new insights into what happens in two brains while they simultaneously interact. But before I do that  let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible. The first is we can now eavesdrop safely on healthy brain activity. Without needles and radioactivity  without any kind of clinical reason  we can go down the street and record from your friends' and neighbors' brains while they do a variety of cognitive tasks  and we use a method called functional magnetic resonance imaging. You've probably all read about it or heard about in some incarnation. Let me give you a two sentence version of it. So we've all heard of MRIs. MRIs use magnetic fields and radio waves and they take snapshots of your brain or your knee or your stomach  grayscale images that are frozen in time. In the     s  it was discovered you could use the same machines in a different mode  and in that mode  you could make microscopic blood flow movies from hundreds of thousands of sites independently in the brain. Okay  so what  In fact  the so what is  in the brain  changes in neural activity  the things that make your brain work  the things that make your software work in your brain  are tightly correlated with changes in blood flow. You make a blood flow movie  you have an independent proxy of brain activity. This has literally revolutionized cognitive science. Take any cognitive domain you want  memory  motor planning  thinking about your mother in law  getting angry at people  emotional response  it goes on and on  put people into functional MRI devices  and image how these kinds of variables map onto brain activity. It's in its early stages  and it's crude by some measures  but in fact     years ago  we were at nothing. You couldn't do people like this. You couldn't do healthy people. That's caused a literal revolution  and it's opened us up to a new experimental preparation. Neurobiologists  as you well know  have lots of experimental preps  worms and rodents and fruit flies and things like this. And now  we have a new experimental prep  human beings. We can now use human beings to study and model the software in human beings  and we have a few burgeoning biological measures. Okay  let me give you one example of the kinds of experiments that people do  and it's in the area of what you'd call valuation. Valuation is just what you think it is  you know  If you went and you were valuing two companies against one another  you'd want to know which was more valuable. Cultures discovered the key feature of valuation thousands of years ago. If you want to compare oranges to windshields  what do you do  Well  you can't compare oranges to windshields. They're immiscible. They don't mix with one another. So instead  you convert them to a common currency scale  put them on that scale  and value them accordingly. Well  your brain has to do something just like that as well  and we're now beginning to understand and identify brain systems involved in valuation  and one of them includes a neurotransmitter system whose cells are located in your brainstem and deliver the chemical dopamine to the rest of your brain. I won't go through the details of it  but that's an important discovery  and we know a good bit about that now  and it's just a small piece of it  but it's important because those are the neurons that you would lose if you had Parkinson's disease  and they're also the neurons that are hijacked by literally every drug of abuse  and that makes sense. Drugs of abuse would come in  and they would change the way you value the world. They change the way you value the symbols associated with your drug of choice  and they make you value that over everything else. Here's the key feature though. These neurons are also involved in the way you can assign value to literally abstract ideas  and I put some symbols up here that we assign value to for various reasons. We have a behavioral superpower in our brain  and it at least in part involves dopamine. We can deny every instinct we have for survival for an idea  for a mere idea. No other species can do that. In       the cult Heaven's Gate committed mass suicide predicated on the idea that there was a spaceship hiding in the tail of the then visible comet Hale Bopp waiting to take them to the next level. It was an incredibly tragic event. More than two thirds of them had college degrees. But the point here is they were able to deny their instincts for survival using exactly the same systems that were put there to make them survive. That's a lot of control  okay  One thing that I've left out of this narrative is the obvious thing  which is the focus of the rest of my little talk  and that is other people. These same valuation systems are redeployed when we're valuing interactions with other people. So this same dopamine system that gets addicted to drugs  that makes you freeze when you get Parkinson's disease  that contributes to various forms of psychosis  is also redeployed to value interactions with other people and to assign value to gestures that you do when you're interacting with somebody else. Let me give you an example of this. You bring to the table such enormous processing power in this domain that you hardly even notice it. Let me just give you a few examples. So here's a baby. She's three months old. She still poops in her diapers and she can't do calculus. She's related to me. Somebody will be very glad that she's up here on the screen. You can cover up one of her eyes  and you can still read something in the other eye  and I see sort of curiosity in one eye  I see maybe a little bit of surprise in the other. Here's a couple. They're sharing a moment together  and we've even done an experiment where you can cut out different pieces of this frame and you can still see that they're sharing it. They're sharing it sort of in parallel. Now  the elements of the scene also communicate this to us  but you can read it straight off their faces  and if you compare their faces to normal faces  it would be a very subtle cue. Here's another couple. He's projecting out at us  and she's clearly projecting  you know  love and admiration at him. Here's another couple.  Laughter  And I'm thinking I'm not seeing love and admiration on the left.  Laughter  In fact  I know this is his sister  and you can just see him saying   Okay  we're doing this for the camera  and then afterwards you steal my candy and you punch me in the face.   Laughter  He'll kill me for showing that. All right  so what does this mean  It means we bring an enormous amount of processing power to the problem. It engages deep systems in our brain  in dopaminergic systems that are there to make you chase sex  food and salt. They keep you alive. It gives them the pie  it gives that kind of a behavioral punch which we've called a superpower. So how can we take that and arrange a kind of staged social interaction and turn that into a scientific probe  And the short answer is games. Economic games. So what we do is we go into two areas. One area is called experimental economics. The other area is called behavioral economics. And we steal their games. And we contrive them to our own purposes. So this shows you one particular game called an ultimatum game. Red person is given a hundred dollars and can offer a split to blue. Let's say red wants to keep     and offers blue   . So he offers a       split with blue. Control passes to blue  and blue says   I accept it   in which case he'd get the money  or blue says   I reject it   in which case no one gets anything. Okay  So a rational choice economist would say  well  you should take all non zero offers. What do people do  People are indifferent at an       split. At        it's a coin flip whether you accept that or not. Why is that  You know  because you're pissed off. You're mad. That's an unfair offer  and you know what an unfair offer is. This is the kind of game done by my lab and many around the world. That just gives you an example of the kind of thing that these games probe. The interesting thing is  these games require that you have a lot of cognitive apparatus on line. You have to be able to come to the table with a proper model of another person. You have to be able to remember what you've done. You have to stand up in the moment to do that. Then you have to update your model based on the signals coming back  and you have to do something that is interesting  which is you have to do a kind of depth of thought assay. That is  you have to decide what that other person expects of you. You have to send signals to manage your image in their mind. Like a job interview. You sit across the desk from somebody  they have some prior image of you  you send signals across the desk to move their image of you from one place to a place where you want it to be. We're so good at this we don't really even notice it. These kinds of probes exploit it. Okay  In doing this  what we've discovered is that humans are literal canaries in social exchanges. Canaries used to be used as kind of biosensors in mines. When methane built up  or carbon dioxide built up  or oxygen was diminished  the birds would swoon before people would    so it acted as an early warning system  Hey  get out of the mine. Things aren't going so well. People come to the table  and even these very blunt  staged social interactions  and they  and there's just numbers going back and forth between the people  and they bring enormous sensitivities to it. So we realized we could exploit this  and in fact  as we've done that  and we've done this now in many thousands of people  I think on the order of five or six thousand. We actually  to make this a biological probe  need bigger numbers than that  remarkably so. But anyway  patterns have emerged  and we've been able to take those patterns  convert them into mathematical models  and use those mathematical models to gain new insights into these exchanges. Okay  so what  Well  the so what is  that's a really nice behavioral measure  the economic games bring to us notions of optimal play. We can compute that during the game. And we can use that to sort of carve up the behavior. Here's the cool thing. Six or seven years ago  we developed a team. It was at the time in Houston  Texas. It's now in Virginia and London. And we built software that'll link functional magnetic resonance imaging devices up over the Internet. I guess we've done up to six machines at a time  but let's just focus on two. So it synchronizes machines anywhere in the world. We synchronize the machines  set them into these staged social interactions  and we eavesdrop on both of the interacting brains. So for the first time  we don't have to look at just averages over single individuals  or have individuals playing computers  or try to make inferences that way. We can study individual dyads. We can study the way that one person interacts with another person  turn the numbers up  and start to gain new insights into the boundaries of normal cognition  but more importantly  we can put people with classically defined mental illnesses  or brain damage  into these social interactions  and use these as probes of that. So we've started this effort. We've made a few hits  a few  I think  embryonic discoveries. We think there's a future to this. But it's our way of going in and redefining  with a new lexicon  a mathematical one actually  as opposed to the standard ways that we think about mental illness  characterizing these diseases  by using the people as birds in the exchanges. That is  we exploit the fact that the healthy partner  playing somebody with major depression  or playing somebody with autism spectrum disorder  or playing somebody with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  we use that as a kind of biosensor  and then we use computer programs to model that person  and it gives us a kind of assay of this. Early days  and we're just beginning  we're setting up sites around the world. Here are a few of our collaborating sites. The hub  ironically enough  is centered in little Roanoke  Virginia. There's another hub in London  now  and the rest are getting set up. We hope to give the data away at some stage. That's a complicated issue about making it available to the rest of the world. But we're also studying just a small part of what makes us interesting as human beings  and so I would invite other people who are interested in this to ask us for the software  or even for guidance on how to move forward with that. Let me leave you with one thought in closing. The interesting thing about studying cognition has been that we've been limited  in a way. We just haven't had the tools to look at interacting brains simultaneously. The fact is  though  that even when we're alone  we're a profoundly social creature. We're not a solitary mind built out of properties that kept it alive in the world independent of other people. In fact  our minds depend on other people. They depend on other people  and they're expressed in other people  so the notion of who you are  you often don't know who you are until you see yourself in interaction with people that are close to you  people that are enemies of you  people that are agnostic to you. So this is the first sort of step into using that insight into what makes us human beings  turning it into a tool  and trying to gain new insights into mental illness. Thanks for having me.  Applause  I want to talk to you today about something the open source programming world can teach democracy  but before that  a little preamble. Let's start here. This is Martha Payne. Martha's a   year old Scot who lives in the Council of Argyll and Bute. A couple months ago  Payne started a food blog called NeverSeconds  and she would take her camera with her every day to school to document her school lunches. Can you spot the vegetable   Laughter  And  as sometimes happens  this blog acquired first dozens of readers  and then hundreds of readers  and then thousands of readers  as people tuned in to watch her rate her school lunches  including on my favorite category   Pieces of hair found in food.   Laughter  This was a zero day. That's good. And then two weeks ago yesterday  she posted this. A post that read   Goodbye.  And she said   I'm very sorry to tell you this  but my head teacher pulled me out of class today and told me I'm not allowed to take pictures in the lunch room anymore. I really enjoyed doing this. Thank you for reading. Goodbye.  You can guess what happened next  right   Laughter  The outrage was so swift  so voluminous  so unanimous  that the Council of Argyll and Bute reversed themselves the same day and said   We would  we would never censor a nine year old.   Laughter  Except  of course  this morning.  Laughter  And this brings up the question  what made them think they could get away with something like that   Laughter  And the answer is  all of human history prior to now. what happens when a medium suddenly puts a lot of new ideas into circulation  Now  this isn't just a contemporaneous question. This is something we've faced several times over the last few centuries. When the telegraph came along  it was clear that it was going to globalize the news industry. What would this lead to  Well  obviously  it would lead to world peace. The television  a medium that allowed us not just to hear but see  literally see  what was going on elsewhere in the world  what would this lead to  World peace.  Laughter  The telephone  You guessed it  world peace. Sorry for the spoiler alert  but no world peace. Not yet. Even the printing press  even the printing press was assumed to be a tool that was going to enforce Catholic intellectual hegemony across Europe. Instead  what we got was Martin Luther's    Theses  the Protestant Reformation  and  you know  the Thirty Years' War. All right  so what all of these predictions of world peace got right is that when a lot of new ideas suddenly come into circulation  it changes society. What they got exactly wrong was what happens next. The more ideas there are in circulation  the more ideas there are for any individual to disagree with. More media always means more arguing. That's what happens when the media's space expands. And yet  when we look back on the printing press in the early years  we like what happened. We are a pro printing press society. So how do we square those two things  that it leads to more arguing  but we think it was good  And the answer  I think  can be found in things like this. This is the cover of  Philosophical Transactions   the first scientific journal ever published in English in the middle of the     s  and it was created by a group of people who had been calling themselves  The Invisible College   a group of natural philosophers who only later would call themselves scientists  and they wanted to improve the way natural philosophers argued with each other  and they needed to do two things for this. They needed openness. They needed to create a norm which said  when you do an experiment  you have to publish not just your claims  but how you did the experiment. If you don't tell us how you did it  we won't trust you. But the other thing they needed was speed. They had to quickly synchronize what other natural philosophers knew. Otherwise  you couldn't get the right kind of argument going. The printing press was clearly the right medium for this  but the book was the wrong tool. It was too slow. And so they invented the scientific journal as a way of synchronizing the argument across the community of natural scientists. The scientific revolution wasn't created by the printing press. It was created by scientists  but it couldn't have been created if they didn't have a printing press as a tool. So what about us  What about our generation  and our media revolution  the Internet  Well  predictions of world peace  Check.  Laughter  More arguing  Gold star on that one.  Laughter  I mean  YouTube is just a gold mine.  Laughter  Better arguing  That's the question. So I study social media  which means  to a first approximation  I watch people argue. And if I had to pick a group that I think is our Invisible College  is our generation's collection of people trying to take these tools and to press it into service  not for more arguments  but for better arguments  I'd pick the open source programmers. Programming is a three way relationship between a programmer  some source code  and the computer it's meant to run on  but computers are such famously inflexible interpreters of instructions that it's extraordinarily difficult to write out a set of instructions that the computer knows how to execute  and that's if one person is writing it. Once you get more than one person writing it  it's very easy for any two programmers to overwrite each other's work if they're working on the same file  or to send incompatible instructions that simply causes the computer to choke  and this problem grows larger the more programmers are involved. To a first approximation  the problem of managing a large software project is the problem of keeping this social chaos at bay. Now  for decades there has been a canonical solution to this problem  which is to use something called a  version control system   and a version control system does what is says on the tin. It provides a canonical copy of the software on a server somewhere. The only programmers who can change it are people who've specifically been given permission to access it  and they're only allowed to access the sub section of it that they have permission to change. And when people draw diagrams of version control systems  the diagrams always look something like this. All right. They look like org charts. And you don't have to squint very hard to see the political ramifications of a system like this. This is feudalism  one owner  many workers. Now  that's fine for the commercial software industry. It really is Microsoft's Office. It's Adobe's Photoshop. The corporation owns the software. The programmers come and go. But there was one programmer who decided that this wasn't the way to work. This is Linus Torvalds. Torvalds is the most famous open source programmer  created Linux  obviously  and Torvalds looked at the way the open source movement had been dealing with this problem. Open source software  the core promise of the open source license  is that everybody should have access to all the source code all the time  but of course  this creates the very threat of chaos you have to forestall in order to get anything working. So most open source projects just held their noses and adopted the feudal management systems. But Torvalds said   No  I'm not going to do that.  His point of view on this was very clear. When you adopt a tool  you also adopt the management philosophy embedded in that tool  and he wasn't going to adopt anything that didn't work the way the Linux community worked. And to give you a sense of how enormous a decision like this was  this is a map of the internal dependencies within Linux  within the Linux operating system  which sub parts of the program rely on which other sub parts to get going. This is a tremendously complicated process. This is a tremendously complicated program  and yet  for years  Torvalds ran this not with automated tools but out of his email box. People would literally mail him changes that they'd agreed on  and he would merge them by hand. And then     years after looking at Linux and figuring out how the community worked  he said   I think I know how to write a version control system for free people.  And he called it  Git.  Git is distributed version control. It has two big differences with traditional version control systems. The first is that it lives up to the philosophical promise of open source. Everybody who works on a project has access to all of the source code all of the time. And when people draw diagrams of Git workflow  they use drawings that look like this. And you don't have to understand what the circles and boxes and arrows mean to see that this is a far more complicated way of working than is supported by ordinary version control systems. But this is also the thing that brings the chaos back  and this is Git's second big innovation. This is a screenshot from GitHub  the premier Git hosting service  and every time a programmer uses Git to make any important change at all  creating a new file  modifying an existing one  merging two files  Git creates this kind of signature. This long string of numbers and letters here is a unique identifier tied to every single change  but without any central coordination. Every Git system generates this number the same way  which means this is a signature tied directly and unforgeably to a particular change. This has the following effect  A programmer in Edinburgh and a programmer in Entebbe can both get the same    a copy of the same piece of software. Each of them can make changes and they can merge them after the fact even if they didn't know of each other's existence beforehand. This is cooperation without coordination. This is the big change. Now  I tell you all of this not to convince you that it's great that open source programmers now have a tool that supports their philosophical way of working  although I think that is great. I tell you all of this because of what I think it means for the way communities come together. Once Git allowed for cooperation without coordination  you start to see communities form that are enormously large and complex. This is a graph of the Ruby community. It's an open source programming language  and all of the interconnections between the people    this is now not a software graph  but a people graph  all of the interconnections among the people working on that project   and this doesn't look like an org chart. This looks like a dis org chart  and yet  out of this community  but using these tools  they can now create something together. So there are two good reasons to think that this kind of technique can be applied to democracies in general and in particular to the law. When you make the claim  in fact  that something on the Internet is going to be good for democracy  you often get this reaction. Which is  are you talking about the thing with the singing cats  Like  is that the thing you think is going to be good for society  To which I have to say  here's the thing with the singing cats. That always happens. And I don't just mean that always happens with the Internet  I mean that always happens with media  full stop. It did not take long after the rise of the commercial printing press before someone figured out that erotic novels were a good idea.  Laughter  You don't have to have an economic incentive to sell books very long before someone says   Hey  you know what I bet people would pay for    Laughter  It took people another     years to even think of the scientific journal  right  So     Laughter   Applause  So the harnessing by the Invisible College of the printing press to create the scientific journal was phenomenally important  but it didn't happen big  and it didn't happen quick  and it didn't happen fast  so if you're going to look for where the change is happening  you have to look on the margins. So  the law is also dependency related. This is a graph of the U.S. Tax Code  and the dependencies of one law on other laws for the overall effect. So there's that as a site for source code management. But there's also the fact that law is another place where there are many opinions in circulation  but they need to be resolved to one canonical copy  and when you go onto GitHub  and you look around  there are millions and millions of projects  almost all of which are source code  but if you look around the edges  you can see people experimenting with the political ramifications of a system like that. Someone put up all the Wikileaked cables from the State Department  along with software used to interpret them  including my favorite use ever of the Cablegate cables  which is a tool for detecting naturally occurring haiku in State Department prose. Right.  Laughter  The New York Senate has put up something called Open Legislation  also hosting it on GitHub  again for all of the reasons of updating and fluidity. You can go and pick your Senator and then you can see a list of bills they have sponsored. Someone going by Divegeek has put up the Utah code  the laws of the state of Utah  and they've put it up there not just to distribute the code  but with the very interesting possibility that this could be used to further the development of legislation. Somebody put up a tool during the copyright debate last year in the Senate  saying   It's strange that Hollywood has more access to Canadian legislators than Canadian citizens do. Why don't we use GitHub to show them what a citizen developed bill might look like   And it includes this very evocative screenshot. This is a called a  diff   this thing on the right here. This shows you  for text that many people are editing  when a change was made  who made it  and what the change is. The stuff in red is the stuff that got deleted. The stuff in green is the stuff that got added. Programmers take this capability for granted. No democracy anywhere in the world offers this feature to its citizens for either legislation or for budgets  even though those are the things done with our consent and with our money. Now  I would love to tell you that the fact that the open source programmers have worked out a collaborative method that is large scale  distributed  cheap  and in sync with the ideals of democracy  I would love to tell you that because those tools are in place  the innovation is inevitable. But it's not. Part of the problem  of course  is just a lack of information. Somebody put a question up on Quora saying   Why is it that lawmakers don't use distributed version control   This  graphically  was the answer.  Laughter  And that is indeed part of the problem  but only part. The bigger problem  of course  is power. The people experimenting with participation don't have legislative power  and the people who have legislative power are not experimenting with participation. They are experimenting with openness. There's no democracy worth the name that doesn't have a transparency move  but transparency is openness in only one direction  and being given a dashboard without a steering wheel has never been the core promise a democracy makes to its citizens. So consider this. The thing that got Martha Payne's opinions out into the public was a piece of technology  but the thing that kept them there was political will. It was the expectation of the citizens that she would not be censored. That's now the state we're in with these collaboration tools. We have them. We've seen them. They work. Can we use them  Can we apply the techniques that worked here to this  T.S. Eliot once said   One of the most momentous things that can happen to a culture is that they acquire a new form of prose.  I think that's wrong  but     Laughter  I think it's right for argumentation. Right  A momentous thing that can happen to a culture is they can acquire a new style of arguing  trial by jury  voting  peer review  now this. Right  A new form of arguing has been invented in our lifetimes  in the last decade  in fact. It's large  it's distributed  it's low cost  and it's compatible with the ideals of democracy. The question for us now is  are we going to let the programmers keep it to themselves  Or are we going to try and take it and press it into service for society at large  Thank you for listening.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Hi. So  this chap here  he thinks he can tell you the future. His name is Nostradamus  although here the Sun have made him look a little bit like Sean Connery.  Laughter  And like most of you  I suspect  I don't really believe that people can see into the future. I don't believe in precognition  and every now and then  you hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future  and that's probably because it was a fluke  and we only hear about the flukes and about the freaks. We don't hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong. Now we expect that to happen with silly stories about precognition  but the problem is  we have exactly the same problem in academia and in medicine  and in this environment  it costs lives. So firstly  thinking just about precognition  as it turns out  just last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted a piece of research where he found evidence of precognitive powers in undergraduate students  and this was published in a peer reviewed academic journal and most of the people who read this just said   Okay  well  fair enough  but I think that's a fluke  that's a freak  because I know that if I did a study where I found no evidence that undergraduate students had precognitive powers  it probably wouldn't get published in a journal. And in fact  we know that that's true  because several different groups of research scientists tried to replicate the findings of this precognition study  and when they submitted it to the exact same journal  the journal said   No  we're not interested in publishing replication. We're not interested in your negative data.  So this is already evidence of how  in the academic literature  we will see a biased sample of the true picture of all of the scientific studies that have been conducted. But it doesn't just happen in the dry academic field of psychology. It also happens in  for example  cancer research. So in March        just one month ago  some researchers reported in the journal Nature how they had tried to replicate    different basic science studies looking at potential treatment targets in cancer  and out of those    studies  they were only able to successfully replicate six. Forty seven out of those    were unreplicable. And they say in their discussion that this is very likely because freaks get published. People will do lots and lots and lots of different studies  and the occasions when it works they will publish  and the ones where it doesn't work they won't. And their first recommendation of how to fix this problem  because it is a problem  because it sends us all down blind alleys  their first recommendation of how to fix this problem is to make it easier to publish negative results in science  and to change the incentives so that scientists are encouraged to post more of their negative results in public. But it doesn't just happen in the very dry world of preclinical basic science cancer research. It also happens in the very real  flesh and blood of academic medicine. So in       some researchers did a study on a drug called lorcainide  and this was an anti arrhythmic drug  a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms  and the idea was  after people have had a heart attack  they're quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms  so if we give them a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms  this will increase the chances of them surviving. Early on its development  they did a very small trial  just under a hundred patients. Fifty patients got lorcainide  and of those patients     died. Another    patients got a dummy placebo sugar pill with no active ingredient  and only one of them died. So they rightly regarded this drug as a failure  and its commercial development was stopped  and because its commercial development was stopped  this trial was never published. Unfortunately  over the course of the next five     years  other companies had the same idea about drugs that would prevent arrhythmias in people who have had heart attacks. These drugs were brought to market. They were prescribed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing  and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we detected that safety signal  over         people died unnecessarily in America from the prescription of anti arrhythmic drugs. Now actually  in       the researchers who did that      study  that early study  published a mea culpa  an apology to the scientific community  in which they said   When we carried out our study in       we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance.  The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons  and this study was never published  it's now a good example of publication bias. That's the technical term for the phenomenon where unflattering data gets lost  gets unpublished  is left missing in action  and they say the results described here  might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead.  Now these are stories from basic science. These are stories from        years ago. The academic publishing environment is very different now. There are academic journals like  Trials   the open access journal  which will publish any trial conducted in humans regardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result. But this problem of negative results that go missing in action is still very prevalent. In fact it's so prevalent that it cuts to the core of evidence based medicine. So this is a drug called reboxetine  and this is a drug that I myself have prescribed. It's an antidepressant. And I'm a very nerdy doctor  so I read all of the studies that I could on this drug. I read the one study that was published that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo  and I read the other three studies that were published that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant  and because this patient hadn't done well on those other antidepressants  I thought  well  reboxetine is just as good. It's one to try. But it turned out that I was misled. In fact  seven trials were conducted comparing reboxetine against a dummy placebo sugar pill. One of them was positive and that was published  but six of them were negative and they were left unpublished. Three trials were published comparing reboxetine against other antidepressants in which reboxetine was just as good  and they were published  but three times as many patients' worth of data was collected which showed that reboxetine was worse than those other treatments  and those trials were not published. I felt misled. Now you might say  well  that's an extremely unusual example  and I wouldn't want to be guilty of the same kind of cherry picking and selective referencing that I'm accusing other people of. But it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias has actually been very  very well studied. So here is one example of how you approach it. The classic model is  you get a bunch of studies where you know that they've been conducted and completed  and then you go and see if they've been published anywhere in the academic literature. So this took all of the trials that had ever been conducted on antidepressants that were approved over a    year period by the FDA. They took all of the trials which were submitted to the FDA as part of the approval package. So that's not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs  because we can never know if we have those  but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization. And then they went to see if these trials had been published in the peer reviewed academic literature. And this is what they found. It was pretty much a       split. Half of these trials were positive  half of them were negative  in reality. But when they went to look for these trials in the peer reviewed academic literature  what they found was a very different picture. Only three of the negative trials were published  but all but one of the positive trials were published. Now if we just flick back and forth between those two  you can see what a staggering difference there was between reality and what doctors  patients  commissioners of health services  and academics were able to see in the peer reviewed academic literature. We were misled  and this is a systematic flaw in the core of medicine. In fact  there have been so many studies conducted on publication bias now  over a hundred  that they've been collected in a systematic review  published in       that took every single study on publication bias that they could find. Publication bias affects every field of medicine. About half of all trials  on average  go missing in action  and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely to be published as negative findings. This is a cancer at the core of evidence based medicine. If I flipped a coin     times but then withheld the results from you from half of those tosses  I could make it look as if I had a coin that always came up heads. But that wouldn't mean that I had a two headed coin. That would mean that I was a chancer and you were an idiot for letting me get away with it.  Laughter  But this is exactly what we blindly tolerate in the whole of evidence based medicine. And to me  this is research misconduct. If I conducted one study and I withheld half of the data points from that one study  you would rightly accuse me  essentially  of research fraud. And yet  for some reason  if somebody conducts    studies but only publishes the five that give the result that they want  we don't consider that to be research misconduct. And when that responsibility is diffused between a whole network of researchers  academics  industry sponsors  journal editors  for some reason we find it more acceptable  but the effect on patients is damning. And this is happening right now  today. This is a drug called Tamiflu. Tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling  and we've stockpiled Tamiflu in panic  in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza. Complications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia and death.  Laughter  Now when the Cochrane systematic reviewers were trying to collect together all of the data from all of the trials that had ever been conducted on whether Tamiflu actually did this or not  they found that several of those trials were unpublished. The results were unavailable to them. And when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means  through Freedom of Information Act requests  through harassing various different organizations  what they found was inconsistent. And when they tried to get a hold of the clinical study reports  the        page long documents that have the best possible rendition of the information  they were told they weren't allowed to have them. And if you want to read the full correspondence and the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company  you can see that written up in this week's edition of PLOS Medicine. And the most staggering thing of all of this  to me  is that not only is this a problem  not only do we recognize that this is a problem  but we've had to suffer fake fixes. We've had people pretend that this is a problem that's been fixed. First of all  we had trials registers  and everybody said  oh  it's okay. We'll get everyone to register their trials  they'll post the protocol  they'll say what they're going to do before they do it  and then afterwards we'll be able to check and see if all the trials which have been conducted and completed have been published. But people didn't bother to use those registers. And so then the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors came along  and they said  oh  well  we will hold the line. We won't publish any journals  we won't publish any trials  unless they've been registered before they began. But they didn't hold the line. In       a study was conducted which showed that half of all of trials published by journals edited by members of the ICMJE weren't properly registered  and a quarter of them weren't registered at all. And then finally  the FDA Amendment Act was passed a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conducts a trial must post the results of that trial within one year. And in the BMJ  in the first edition of January        you can see a study which looks to see if people kept to that ruling  and it turns out that only one in five have done so. This is a disaster. We cannot know the true effects of the medicines that we prescribe if we do not have access to all of the information. And this is not a difficult problem to fix. We need to force people to publish all trials conducted in humans  including the older trials  because the FDA Amendment Act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after       and I don't know what world it is in which we're only practicing medicine on the basis of trials that completed in the past two years. We need to publish all trials in humans  including the older trials  for all drugs in current use  and you need to tell everyone you know that this is a problem and that it has not been fixed. Thank you very much.  Applause  Two years ago  I was invited as an artist to participate in an exhibition commemorating     years of Islamic art in Europe. The curator had only one condition  I had to use the Arabic script for my artwork. Now  as an artist  a woman  an Arab  or a human being living in the world in       I only had one thing to say  I wanted to say no. And in Arabic  to say  no   we say  no  and a thousand times no.  So I decided to look for a thousand different noes. on everything ever produced under Islamic or Arab patronage in the past       years  from Spain to the borders of China. I collected my findings in a book  placed them chronologically  stating the name  the patron  the medium and the date. Now  the book sat on a small shelf next to the installation  which stood three by seven meters  in Munich  Germany  in September of     . Now  in January        the revolution started  and life stopped for    days  and on the   th of February  we naively celebrated on the streets of Cairo  believing that the revolution had succeeded. Nine months later I found myself spraying messages in Tahrir Square. The reason for this act was this image that I saw in my newsfeed. I did not feel that I could live in a city where people were being killed and thrown like garbage on the street. So I took one  no  off a tombstone from the Islamic Museum in Cairo  and I added a message to it   no to military rule.  And I started spraying that on the streets in Cairo. But that led to a series of no  coming out of the book like ammunition  and adding messages to them  and I started spraying them on the walls. So I'll be sharing some of these noes with you. No to a new Pharaoh  because whoever comes next should understand that we will never be ruled by another dictator. No to violence  Ramy Essam came to Tahrir on the second day of the revolution  and he sat there with this guitar  singing. One month after Mubarak stepped down  this was his reward. No to blinding heroes. Ahmed Harara lost his right eye on the   th of January  and he lost his left eye on the   th of November  by two different snipers. No to killing  in this case no to killing men of religion  because Sheikh Ahmed Adina Refaat was shot on December   th  during a demonstration  leaving behind three orphans and a widow. No to burning books. The Institute of Egypt was burned on December   th  a huge cultural loss. No to stripping the people  and the blue bra is to remind us of our shame as a nation when we allow a veiled woman to be stripped and beaten on the street  and the footprint reads   Long live a peaceful revolution   because we will never retaliate with violence. No to barrier walls. On February  th  concrete roadblocks were set up in Cairo to protect the Ministry of Defense from protesters. Now  speaking of walls  I want to share with you the story of one wall in Cairo. A group of artists decided to paint a life size tank on a wall. It's one to one. In front of this tank there's a man on a bicycle with a breadbasket on his head. To any passerby  there's no problem with this visual. After acts of violence  another artist came  painted blood  protesters being run over by the tank  demonstrators  and a message that read   Starting tomorrow  I wear the new face  the face of every martyr. I exist.  Authority comes  paints the wall white  leaves the tank and adds a message   Army and people  one hand. Egypt for Egyptians.  Another artist comes  paints the head of the military as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood in front of the tank. Authority comes  paints the wall white  leaves the tank  leaves the suit  and throws a bucket of black paint just to hide the face of the monster. So I come with my stencils  and I spray them on the suit  on the tank  and on the whole wall  and this is how it stands today until further notice.  Laughter  Now  I want to leave you with a final no. I found Neruda scribbled on a piece of paper in a field hospital in Tahrir  and I decided to take a no of Mamluk Mausoleum in Cairo. The message reads   Arabic   You can crush the flowers  but you can't delay spring.  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Shukran.  Applause  What I do is I organize information. I'm a graphic designer. Professionally  I try to make sense often of things that don't make much sense themselves. So my father might not understand what it is that I do for a living. His part of my ancestry has been farmers. He's part of this ethnic minority called the Pontic Greeks. They lived in Asia Minor and fled to Greece after a genocide about a hundred years ago. And ever since that  migration has somewhat been a theme in my family. My father moved to Germany  studied there and married  and as a result  I now have this half German brain  with all the analytical thinking and that slightly dorky demeanor that come with that. And of course it meant that I was a foreigner in both countries  and that of course made it pretty easy for me to migrate as well  in good family tradition  if you like. But of course  most journeys that we undertake from day to day are within a city. And  especially if you know the city  getting from A to B may seem pretty obvious  right  But the question is  why is it obvious  How do we know where we're going  So I washed up on a Dublin ferry port about    years ago  a professional foreigner  if you like  and I'm sure you've all had this experience before  yeah  You arrive in a new city  and your brain is trying to make sense of this new place. Once you find your base  your home  you start to build this cognitive map of your environment. It's essentially this virtual map that only exists in your brain. All animal species do it  even though we all use slightly different tools. Us humans  of course  we don't move around marking our territory by scent  like dogs. We don't run around emitting ultrasonic squeaks  like bats. We just don't do that  although a night in the Temple Bar district can get pretty wild. No  we do two important things to make a place our own. First  we move along linear routes. Typically  we find a main street  and this main street becomes a linear strip map in our minds. But our mind keeps it pretty simple  yeah  Every street is generally perceived as a straight line  and we kind of ignore the little twists and turns that the streets make. When we do  however  make a turn into a side street  our mind tends to adjust that turn to a    degree angle. This of course makes for some funny moments when you're in some old city layout that follows some sort of circular city logic  yeah  Maybe you've had that experience as well. Let's say you're on some spot on a side street that projects from a main cathedral square  and you want to get to another point on a side street just like that. The cognitive map in your mind may tell you   Aris  go back to the main cathedral square  take a    degree turn and walk down that other side street.  But somehow you feel adventurous that day  and you suddenly discover that the two spots were actually only a single building apart. Now  I don't know about you  but I always feel like I find this wormhole or this inter dimensional portal. So we move along linear routes and our mind straightens streets and perceives turns as    degree angles. The second thing that we do to make a place our own is we attach meaning and emotions to the things that we see along those lines. If you go to the Irish countryside and you ask an old lady for directions  brace yourself for some elaborate Irish storytelling about all the landmarks  yeah  She'll tell you the pub where her sister used to work  and  ... go past that church where I got married   that kind of thing. So we fill our cognitive maps with these markers of meaning. What's more  we abstract repeat patterns and recognize them. We recognize them by the experiences and we abstract them into symbols. And of course  we're all capable of understanding these symbols. What's more  we're all capable of understanding the cognitive maps  and you are all capable of creating these cognitive maps yourselves. So next time  when you want to tell your friend how to get to your place  you grab a beermat  grab a napkin  and you just observe yourself create this awesome piece of communication design. It's got straight lines. It's got    degree corners. You might add little symbols along the way. And when you look at what you've just drawn  you realize it does not resemble a street map. If you were to put an actual street map on top of what you've just drawn  you'd realize your streets and the distances    they'd be way off. No  what you've just drawn is more like a diagram or a schematic. It's a visual construct of lines  dots  letters  designed in the language of our brains. So it's no big surprise that the big information design icon of the last century    the pinnacle of showing everybody how to get from A to B  the London Underground map    was not designed by a cartographer or a city planner  it was designed by an engineering draftsman. In the     s  Harry Beck applied the principles of schematic diagram design and changed the way public transport maps are designed forever. Now the very key to the success of this map is in the omission of less important information and in the extreme simplification. So  straightened streets  corners of    and    degrees  but also the extreme geographic distortion in that map. If you were to look at the actual locations of these stations  you'd see they're very different. But this is all for the clarity of the public Tube map. If you  say  wanted to get from Regent's Park station to Great Portland Street  the Tube map would tell you  take the Tube  go to Baker Street  change over  take another Tube. Of course  what you don't know is that the two stations are only about a hundred meters apart. Now we've reached the subject of public transport  and public transport here in Dublin is a somewhat touchy subject. For everybody who does not know the public transport here in Dublin  essentially  we have this system of local buses that grew with the city. For every outskirt that was added  there was another bus route added  running from the outskirt all the way to the city center. And as these local buses approach the city center  they all run side by side and converge in pretty much one main street. So when I stepped off the boat    years ago  I tried to make sense of that. Because exploring a city on foot only gets you so far. But when you explore a foreign and new public transport system  you will build a cognitive map in your mind in pretty much the same way. Typically  you choose yourself a rapid transport route  and in your mind  this route is perceived as a straight line. And like a pearl necklace  all the stations and stops are nicely and neatly aligned along the line. And only then you start to discover some local bus routes that would fill in the gaps  and that allow for those wormhole  inter dimensional portal shortcuts. So I tried to make sense  and when I arrived  I was looking for some information leaflets that would help me crack this system and understand it  and I found those brochures. They were not geographically distorted. They had a lot of omission of information  but unfortunately  the wrong information. Say  in the city center    there were never actually any lines that showed the routes. There are actually not even any stations with names. Now  the maps of Dublin transport have gotten better  and after I finished the project  they got a good bit better  but still no station names  still no routes. So  being naive  and being half German  I decided   Aris  why don't you build your own map   So that's what I did. I researched how each and every bus route moved through the city  nice and logical  every bus route a separate line. I plotted it into my own map of Dublin  and in the city center ... I got a nice spaghetti plate. Now  this is a bit of a mess  so I decided  of course   You're going to apply the rules of schematic design   cleaning up the corridors  widening the streets where there were loads of buses and making the streets at straight     degree corners     degree corners or fractions of that  and filled it in with the bus routes. And I built this city center bus map of the system  how it was five years ago. I'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact of the quays and Westmoreland Street. Now I can proudly say    I can proudly say  as a public transport map  this diagram is an utter failure. Except  probably  in one aspect  I now had a great visual representation of just how clogged up and overrun the city center really was. Now  call me old fashioned  but I think a public transport route map should have lines  because that's what they are  yeah  They're little pieces of string that wrap their way through the city center or through the city. If you will  the Greek guy inside of me feels if I don't get a line  it's like entering the labyrinth of the Minotaur without having Ariadne giving you the string to find your way. So the outcome of my academic research  loads of questionnaires  case studies and looking at a lot of maps  was that a lot of the problems and shortcomings of the public transport system here in Dublin was the lack of a coherent public transport map    a simplified  coherent public transport map    because I think this is the crucial step to understanding a public transport network on a physical level  but it's also the crucial step to make a public transport network mappable on a visual level. So I teamed up with a gentleman called James Leahy  a civil engineer and a recent master's graduate of the Sustainable Development program at DIT  and together we drafted the simplified model network  which I could then go ahead and visualize. So here's what we did. We distributed these rapid transport corridors throughout the city center  and extended them into the outskirts. Rapid  because we wanted them to be served by rapid transport vehicles. They would get exclusive road use  where possible  and it would be high quantity  high quality transport. James wanted to use bus rapid transport for that  rather than light rail. For me  it was important that the vehicles that would run on those rapid transport corridors would be visibly distinguishable from local buses on the street. Now we could take out all the local buses that ran alongside those rapid transport means. Any gaps that appeared in the outskirts were filled again. So  in other words  if there was a street in an outskirt where there had been a bus  we put a bus back in  only now these buses wouldn't run all the way to the city center  but connect to the nearest rapid transport mode  one of these thick lines over there. So the rest was merely a couple of months of work  and a couple of fights with my girlfriend  of our place constantly being clogged up with maps  and the outcome  one of the outcomes  was this map of the Greater Dublin area. I'll zoom in a little bit. This map only shows the rapid transport connections  no local bus  very much in the  metro map  style that was so successful in London  and that since has been exported to so many other major cities  and therefore is the language that we should use for public transport maps. What's also important is  with a simplified network like this  it now would become possible for me to tackle the ultimate challenge and make a public transport map for the city center  one where I wouldn't just show rapid transport connections  but also all the local bus routes  streets and the likes  and this is what a map like this could look like. I'll zoom in a little bit. In this map  I'm including each transport mode  so rapid transport  bus  DART  tram and the likes. Each individual route is represented by a separate line. The map shows each and every station  each and every station name  and I'm also displaying side streets. In fact  most of the side streets even with their name  and for good measure  also a couple of landmarks  some of them signified by little symbols  others by these isometric three dimensional bird's eye view drawings. The map is relatively small in overall size  so something that you could still hold as a fold out map or display in a reasonably sized display box on a bus shelter. I think it tries to be the best balance between actual representation and simplification    the language of way finding in our brain. So  straightened lines  cleaned up corners  and of course  that very  very important geographic distortion that makes public transport maps possible. If you  for example  have a look at the two main corridors that run through the city    the yellow and orange one over here    this is how they look in an actual  accurate street map  and this is how they would look in my distorted  simplified public transport map. So for a successful public transport map  we should not stick to accurate representation  but design them in the way our brains work. The reactions I got were tremendous  it was really good to see. And of course  for my own self  I was very happy to see that my folks in Germany and Greece finally have an idea what I do for a living. Thank you. This is the skyline of my hometown  New Orleans. It was a great place to grow up  but it's one of the most vulnerable spots in the world. Half the city is already below sea level. In       the world watched as New Orleans and the Gulf Coast were devastated by Hurricane Katrina. One thousand  eight hundred and thirty six people died. Nearly         homes were lost. These are my mother's  at the top    although that's not her car  it was carried there by floodwaters up to the roof    and that's my sister's  below. Fortunately  they and other family members got out in time  but they lost their homes  and as you can see  just about everything in them. Other parts of the world have been hit by storms in even more devastating ways. In       Cyclone Nargis and its aftermath killed         in Myanmar. Climate change is affecting our homes  our communities  our way of life. We should be preparing at every scale and at every opportunity. This talk is about being prepared for  and resilient to the changes that are coming and that will affect our homes and our collective home  the Earth. The changes in these times won't affect us all equally. There are important distributional consequences  and they're not what you always might think. In New Orleans  the elderly and female headed households were among the most vulnerable. For those in vulnerable  low lying nations  how do you put a dollar value on losing your country where you ancestors are buried  And where will your people go  And how will they cope in a foreign land  Will there be tensions over immigration  or conflicts over competition for limited resources  It's already fueled conflicts in Chad and Darfur. Like it or not  ready or not  this is our future. Sure  some are looking for opportunities in this new world. That's the Russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding Arctic sea ice. But while there might be some short term individual winners  our collective losses will far outweigh them. Look no further than the insurance industry as they struggle to cope with mounting catastrophic losses from extreme weather events. The military gets it. They call climate change a threat multiplier that could harm stability and security  while governments around the world are evaluating how to respond. So what can we do  How can we prepare and adapt  I'd like to share three sets of examples  starting with adapting to violent storms and floods. In New Orleans  the I    Twin Spans  with sections knocked out in Katrina  have been rebuilt    feet higher to allow for greater storm surge. And these raised and energy efficient homes were developed by Brad Pitt and Make It Right for the hard hit Ninth Ward. The devastated church my mom attends has been not only rebuilt higher  it's poised to become the first Energy Star church in the country. They're selling electricity back to the grid thanks to solar panels  reflective paint and more. Their March electricity bill was only    dollars. Now these are examples of New Orleans rebuilding in this way  but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind. For example  in Galveston  here's a resilient home that survived Hurricane Ike  when others on neighboring lots clearly did not. And around the world  satellites and warning systems are saving lives in flood prone areas such as Bangladesh. But as important as technology and infrastructure are  perhaps the human element is even more critical. We need better planning and systems for evacuation. We need to better understand how people make decisions in times of crisis  and why. While it's true that many who died in Katrina did not have access to transportation  others who did refused to leave as the storm approached  often because available transportation and shelters refused to allow them to take their pets. Imagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or a rescue. Fortunately in       Congress passed the Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act  Laughter    it spells  PETS    to change that. Second  preparing for heat and drought. Farmers are facing challenges of drought from Asia to Africa  from Australia to Oklahoma  while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in Western Europe in       and again in Russia in     . In Ethiopia     percent  that's     percent of the population  depends on rainfall for its livelihood. Oxfam and Swiss Re  together with Rockefeller Foundation  are helping farmers like this one build hillside terraces and find other ways to conserve water  but they're also providing for insurance when the droughts do come. The stability this provides is giving the farmers the confidence to invest. It's giving them access to affordable credit. It's allowing them to become more productive so that they can afford their own insurance over time  without assistance. It's a virtuous cycle  and one that could be replicated throughout the developing world. After a lethal      heat wave turned refrigerator trucks from the popular Taste of Chicago festival into makeshift morgues  Chicago became a recognized leader  tamping down on the urban heat island impact through opening cooling centers  outreach to vulnerable neighborhoods  planting trees  creating cool white or vegetated green roofs. This is City Hall's green roof  next to Cook County's  portion of the  roof  which is    degrees Fahrenheit hotter at the surface. Washington  D.C.  last year  actually led the nation in new green roofs installed  and they're funding this in part thanks to a five cent tax on plastic bags. They're splitting the cost of installing these green roofs with home and building owners. The roofs not only temper urban heat island impact but they save energy  and therefore money  the emissions that cause climate change  and they also reduce stormwater runoff. So some solutions to heat can provide for win win wins. Third  adapting to rising seas. Sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems  agriculture  even major cities. This is what one to two meters of sea level rise looks like in the Mekong Delta. That's where half of Vietnam's rice is grown. Infrastructure is going to be affected. Airports around the world are located on the coast. It makes sense  right  There's open space  the planes can take off and land without worrying about creating noise or avoiding tall buildings. Here's just one example  San Francisco Airport  with    inches or more of flooding. Imagine the staggering cost of protecting this vital infrastructure with levees. But there might be some changes in store that you might not imagine. For example  planes require more runway for takeoff because the heated  less dense air  provides for less lift. San Francisco is also spending    million dollars to rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment  as water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater  causing backups at the plant  harming the bacteria that are needed to treat the waste. So these outfall pipes have been retrofitted to shut seawater off from entering the system. Beyond these technical solutions  our work at the Georgetown Climate Center with communities encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available and to consider how they can accommodate change. For example  in land use  which areas do you want to protect  through adding a seawall  for example  alter  by raising buildings  or retreat from  to allow the migration of important natural systems  such as wetlands or beaches  Other examples to consider. In the U.K.  the Thames Barrier protects London from storm surge. The Asian Cities Climate  Change  Resilience Network is restoring vital ecosystems like forest mangroves. These are not only important ecosystems in their own right  but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities. New York City is incredibly vulnerable to storms  as you can see from this clever sign  and to sea level rise  and to storm surge  as you can see from the subway flooding. But back above ground  these raised ventilation grates for the subway system show that solutions can be both functional and attractive. In fact  in New York  San Francisco and London  designers have envisioned ways to better integrate the natural and built environments with climate change in mind. I think these are inspiring examples of what's possible when we feel empowered to plan for a world that will be different. But now  a word of caution. Adaptation's too important to be left to the experts. Why  Well  there are no experts. We're entering uncharted territory  and yet our expertise and our systems are based on the past.  Stationarity  is the notion that we can anticipate the future based on the past  and plan accordingly  and this principle governs much of our engineering  our design of critical infrastructure  city water systems  building codes  even water rights and other legal precedents. But we can simply no longer rely on established norms. We're operating outside the bounds of CO  concentrations that the planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years. The larger point I'm trying to make is this. It's up to us to look at our homes and our communities  our vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk  and to find ways to not just survive  but to thrive  and it's up to us to plan and to prepare and to call on our government leaders and require them to do the same  even while they address the underlying causes of climate change. There are no quick fixes. There are no one size fits all solutions. We're all learning by doing. But the operative word is doing. Thank you.  Applause  So I want to start by offering you a free no tech life hack  and all it requires of you is this  that you change your posture for two minutes. But before I give it away  I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body. So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller  Maybe you're hunching  crossing your legs  maybe wrapping your ankles. Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this. Sometimes we spread out.  Laughter  I see you. So I want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now. We're going to come back to that in a few minutes  and I'm hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit  it could significantly change the way your life unfolds. So  we're really fascinated with body language  and we're particularly interested in other people's body language. You know  we're interested in  like  you know    Laughter    an awkward interaction  or a smile  or a contemptuous glance  or maybe a very awkward wink  or maybe even something like a handshake. Narrator  Here they are arriving at Number   . This lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the President of the United States. Here comes the Prime Minister    No.  Laughter   Applause  Amy Cuddy  So a handshake  or the lack of a handshake  can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks. Even the BBC and The New York Times. So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior  or body language    but we call it nonverbals as social scientists    it's language  so we think about communication. When we think about communication  we think about interactions. So what is your body language communicating to me  What's mine communicating to you  And there's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this. So social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of our body language  or other people's body language  on judgments. And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language. And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote  who we ask out on a date. For example  Nalini Ambady  a researcher at Tufts University  shows that when people watch    second soundless clips of real physician patient interactions  their judgments of the physician's niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued. So it doesn't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent  but do we like that person and how they interacted  Even more dramatic  Alex Todorov at Princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates' faces in just one second predict    percent of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes  and even  let's go digital  emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead to you claim more value from that negotiation. If you use them poorly  bad idea. Right  So when we think of nonverbals  we think of how we judge others  how they judge us and what the outcomes are. We tend to forget  though  the other audience that's influenced by our nonverbals  and that's ourselves. We are also influenced by our nonverbals  our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology. So what nonverbals am I talking about  I'm a social psychologist. I study prejudice  and I teach at a competitive business school  so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics. I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance. And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance  Well  this is what they are. So in the animal kingdom  they are about expanding. So you make yourself big  you stretch out  you take up space  you're basically opening up. It's about opening up. And this is true across the animal kingdom. It's not just limited to primates. And humans do the same thing.  Laughter  So they do this both when they have power sort of chronically  and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment. And this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are. This expression  which is known as pride  Jessica Tracy has studied. She shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition. So when they cross the finish line and they've won  it doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it. They do this. So the arms up in the V  the chin is slightly lifted. What do we do when we feel powerless  We do exactly the opposite. We close up. We wrap ourselves up. We make ourselves small. We don't want to bump into the person next to us. So again  both animals and humans do the same thing. And this is what happens when you put together high and low power. So what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the other's nonverbals. So if someone is being really powerful with us  we tend to make ourselves smaller. We don't mirror them. We do the opposite of them. So I'm watching this behavior in the classroom  and what do I notice  I notice that MBA students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals. So you have people who are like caricatures of alphas  really coming into the room  they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts  like they really want to occupy space. When they sit down  they're sort of spread out. They raise their hands like this. You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in. As soon they come in  you see it. You see it on their faces and their bodies  and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny  and they go like this when they raise their hand. I notice a couple of things about this. One  you're not going to be surprised. It seems to be related to gender. So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men. Women feel chronically less powerful than men  so this is not surprising. But the other thing I noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating  and how well they were participating. And this is really important in the MBA classroom  because participation counts for half the grade. So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap. You get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences in grades  and it seems to be partly attributable to participation. So I started to wonder  you know  okay  so you have these people coming in like this  and they're participating. Is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more  So my main collaborator Dana Carney  who's at Berkeley  and I really wanted to know  can you fake it till you make it  Like  can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful  So we know that our nonverbals govern how other people think and feel about us. There's a lot of evidence. But our question really was  do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves  There's some evidence that they do. So  for example  we smile when we feel happy  but also  when we're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this  it makes us feel happy. So it goes both ways. When it comes to power  it also goes both ways. So when you feel powerful  you're more likely to do this  but it's also possible that when you pretend to be powerful  you are more likely to actually feel powerful. So the second question really was  you know  so we know that our minds change our bodies  but is it also true that our bodies change our minds  And when I say minds  in the case of the powerful  what am I talking about  So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings  and in my case  that's hormones. I look at hormones. So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like  So powerful people tend to be  not surprisingly  more assertive and more confident  more optimistic. They actually feel they're going to win even at games of chance. They also tend to be able to think more abstractly. So there are a lot of differences. They take more risks. There are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people. Physiologically  there also are differences on two key hormones  testosterone  which is the dominance hormone  and cortisol  which is the stress hormone. So what we find is that high power alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol  and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol. So what does that mean  When you think about power  people tended to think only about testosterone  because that was about dominance. But really  power is also about how you react to stress. So do you want the high power leader that's dominant  high on testosterone  but really stress reactive  Probably not  right  You want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant  but not very stress reactive  the person who's laid back. So we know that in primate hierarchies  if an alpha needs to take over  if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly  within a few days  that individual's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly. So we have this evidence  both that the body can shape the mind  at least at the facial level  and also that role changes can shape the mind. So what happens  okay  you take a role change  what happens if you do that at a really minimal level  like this tiny manipulation  this tiny intervention   For two minutes   you say   I want you to stand like this  and it's going to make you feel more powerful.  So this is what we did. We decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment  and these people adopted  for two minutes  either high power poses or low power poses  and I'm just going to show you five of the poses  although they took on only two. So here's one. A couple more. This one has been dubbed the  Wonder Woman  by the media. Here are a couple more. So you can be standing or you can be sitting. And here are the low power poses. So you're folding up  you're making yourself small. This one is very low power. When you're touching your neck  you're really protecting yourself. So this is what happens. They come in  they spit into a vial  for two minutes  we say   You need to do this or this.  They don't look at pictures of the poses. We don't want to prime them with a concept of power. We want them to be feeling power. So two minutes they do this. We then ask them   How powerful do you feel   on a series of items  and then we give them an opportunity to gamble  and then we take another saliva sample. That's it. That's the whole experiment. So this is what we find. Risk tolerance  which is the gambling  we find that when you are in the high power pose condition     percent of you will gamble. When you're in the low power pose condition  only    percent  and that's a whopping significant difference. Here's what we find on testosterone. From their baseline when they come in  high power people experience about a    percent increase  and low power people experience about a    percent decrease. So again  two minutes  and you get these changes. Here's what you get on cortisol. High power people experience about a    percent decrease  and the low power people experience about a    percent increase. So two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive  confident and comfortable  or really stress reactive  and feeling sort of shut down. And we've all had the feeling  right  So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves  so it's not just others  but it's also ourselves. Also  our bodies change our minds. But the next question  of course  is  can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways  This is in the lab  it's this little task  it's just a couple of minutes. Where can you actually apply this  Which we cared about  of course. And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations  like social threat situations. Where are you being evaluated  either by your friends  For teenagers  it's at the lunchroom table. For some people it's speaking at a school board meeting. It might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview. We decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through  was the job interview. So we published these findings  and the media are all over it  and they say  Okay  so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview  right  You know  so we were of course horrified  and said  Oh my God  no  that's not what we meant at all. For numerous reasons  no  don't do that. Again  this is not about you talking to other people. It's you talking to yourself. What do you do before you go into a job interview  You do this. You're sitting down. You're looking at your iPhone    or your Android  not trying to leave anyone out. You're looking at your notes  you're hunching up  making yourself small  when really what you should be doing maybe is this  like  in the bathroom  right  Do that. Find two minutes. So that's what we want to test. Okay  So we bring people into a lab  and they do either high  or low power poses again  they go through a very stressful job interview. It's five minutes long. They are being recorded. They're being judged also  and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback  so they look like this. Imagine this is the person interviewing you. So for five minutes  nothing  and this is worse than being heckled. People hate this. It's what Marianne LaFrance calls  standing in social quicksand.  So this really spikes your cortisol. So this is the job interview we put them through  because we really wanted to see what happened. We then have these coders look at these tapes  four of them. They're blind to the hypothesis. They're blind to the conditions. They have no idea who's been posing in what pose  and they end up looking at these sets of tapes  and they say   We want to hire these people   all the high power posers.  We don't want to hire these people. We also evaluate these people much more positively overall.  But what's driving it  It's not about the content of the speech. It's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech. Because we rate them on all these variables related to competence  like  how well structured is the speech  How good is it  What are their qualifications  No effect on those things. This is what's affected. These kinds of things. People are bringing their true selves  basically. They're bringing themselves. They bring their ideas  but as themselves  with no  you know  residue over them. So this is what's driving the effect  or mediating the effect. So when I tell people about this  that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior  and our behavior can change our outcomes  they say to me   It feels fake.  Right  So I said  fake it till you make it. It's not me. I don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud. I don't want to feel like an impostor. I don't want to get there only to feel like I'm not supposed to be here. And that really resonated with me  because I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor and feeling like I'm not supposed to be here. When I was     I was in a really bad car accident. I was thrown out of a car  rolled several times. I was thrown from the car. And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward  and I had been withdrawn from college  and I learned that my IQ had dropped by two standard deviations  which was very traumatic. I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart  and I had been called gifted as a child. So I'm taken out of college  I keep trying to go back. They say   You're not going to finish college. Just  you know  there are other things for you to do  but that's not going to work out for you.  So I really struggled with this  and I have to say  having your identity taken from you  your core identity  and for me it was being smart  having that taken from you  there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that. So I felt entirely powerless. I worked and worked  and I got lucky  and worked  and got lucky  and worked. Eventually I graduated from college. It took me four years longer than my peers  and I convinced someone  my angel advisor  Susan Fiske  to take me on  and so I ended up at Princeton  and I was like  I am not supposed to be here. I am an impostor. And the night before my first year talk  and the first year talk at Princeton is a    minute talk to    people. That's it. I was so afraid of being found out the next day that I called her and said   I'm quitting.  She was like   You are not quitting  because I took a gamble on you  and you're staying. You're going to stay  and this is what you're going to do. You are going to fake it. You're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do. You're just going to do it and do it and do it  even if you're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out of body experience  until you have this moment where you say  'Oh my gosh  I'm doing it. Like  I have become this. I am actually doing this.'  So that's what I did. Five years in grad school  a few years  you know  I'm at Northwestern  I moved to Harvard  I'm at Harvard  I'm not really thinking about it anymore  but for a long time I had been thinking   Not supposed to be here.  So at the end of my first year at Harvard  a student who had not talked in class the entire semester  who I had said   Look  you've gotta participate or else you're going to fail   came into my office. I really didn't know her at all. She came in totally defeated  and she said   I'm not supposed to be here.  And that was the moment for me. Because two things happened. One was that I realized  oh my gosh  I don't feel like that anymore. I don't feel that anymore  but she does  and I get that feeling. And the second was  she is supposed to be here  Like  she can fake it  she can become it. So I was like   Yes  you are  You are supposed to be here  And tomorrow you're going to fake it  you're going to make yourself powerful  and  you know    And you're going to go into the classroom  and you are going to give the best comment ever.  You know  And she gave the best comment ever  and people turned around and were like  oh my God  I didn't even notice her sitting there.  Laughter  She comes back to me months later  and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it  she had actually faked it till she became it. So she had changed. And so I want to say to you  don't fake it till you make it. Fake it till you become it. Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize. The last thing I'm going to leave you with is this. Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes. So  this is two minutes. Two minutes  two minutes  two minutes. Before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation  for two minutes  try doing this  in the elevator  in a bathroom stall  at your desk behind closed doors. That's what you want to do. Configure your brain to cope the best in that situation. Get your testosterone up. Get your cortisol down. Don't leave that situation feeling like  oh  I didn't show them who I am. Leave that situation feeling like  I really feel like I got to say who I am and show who I am. So I want to ask you first  you know  both to try power posing  and also I want to ask you to share the science  because this is simple. I don't have ego involved in this.  Laughter  Give it away. Share it with people  because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power. Give it to them because they can do it in private. They need their bodies  privacy and two minutes  and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life. Thank you. Thank you very much.  Applause  Thank you. It's a distinct privilege to be here. A few weeks ago  I saw a video on YouTube of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bullets. This one entered her left hemisphere  and knocked out her Broca's area  the speech center of her brain. And in this session  Gabby's working with a speech therapist  and she's struggling to produce some of the most basic words  and you can see her growing more and more devastated  until she ultimately breaks down into sobbing tears  and she starts sobbing wordlessly into the arms of her therapist. And after a few moments  her therapist tries a new tack  and they start singing together  and Gabby starts to sing through her tears  and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate the words to a song that describe the way she feels  and she sings  in one descending scale  she sings   Let it shine  let it shine  let it shine.  And it's a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail  in this case literally speak. Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug  one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard  and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called Melodic Intonation Therapy  which has become very popular in music therapy now. Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic  could not form sentences of three  or four word sentences  but they could still sing the lyrics to a song  whether it was  Happy Birthday To You  or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones. And after    hours of intensive singing lessons  he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere's damage. When I was     I visited Dr. Schlaug's lab  and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain    how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non musicians  how music  and listening to music  could just light up the entire brain  from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum  how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism  to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression  how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music  and how late stage Alzheimer's patients  whose dementia was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize their family  could still pick out a tune by Chopin at the piano that they had learned when they were children. But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug  and it was this  that I was at a crossroads in my life  trying to choose between music and medicine. I had just completed my undergraduate  and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe  studying Parkinson's disease at Harvard  and I had fallen in love with neuroscience. I wanted to become a surgeon. I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes  these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia and work with AIDS patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis  or with children with disfiguring cancers. I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor  that doctor without borders. On the other hand  I had played the violin my entire life. Music for me was more than a passion. It was obsession. It was oxygen. I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan  and to have played my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv  and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory  but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine. And that afternoon  I had to ask him   How was it for you making that decision   And he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to  and that for me  medical school could wait  but that the violin simply would not. And after two more years of studying music  I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. Gupta.  Laughter  And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic. It was my first audition  and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week  I was offered the position. And it was a dream. It was a wild dream to perform in an orchestra  to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel  but much more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family  my new musical home. But a year later  I met another musician who had also studied at Juilliard  one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician. Nathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard  but he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early   s  was treated with thorazine at Bellevue  and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles    years later. Nathaniel's story has become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy throughout the United States  as told through the book and the movie  The Soloist   but I became his friend  and I became his violin teacher  and I told him that wherever he had his violin  and wherever I had mine  I would play a lesson with him. And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row  I witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments  from what seemed to me in my untrained eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode. Playing for Nathaniel  the music took on a deeper meaning  because now it was about communication  a communication where words failed  a communication of a message that went deeper than words  that registered at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel's psyche  yet came as a true musical offering from me. I found myself growing outraged that someone like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row because of his mental illness  yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on Skid Row alone who had stories as tragic as his  but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets  And at the very core of this crisis of mine  I felt somehow the life of music had chosen me  where somehow  perhaps possibly in a very naive sense  I felt what Skid Row really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill. But in the end  it was Nathaniel who showed me that if I was truly passionate about change  if I wanted to make a difference  I already had the perfect instrument to do it  that music was the bridge that connected my world and his. There's a beautiful quote by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann  who said   To send light into the darkness of men's hearts  such is the duty of the artist.  And this is a particularly poignant quote because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia and died in asylum. And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel  I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians called Street Symphony  bringing the light of music into the very darkest places  performing for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics on Skid Row  performing for combat veterans with post traumatic stress disorder  and for the incarcerated and those labeled as criminally insane. After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino  a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face  and she had a palsy  she was shaking  and she had this gorgeous smile  and she said that she had never heard classical music before  she didn't think she was going to like it  she had never heard a violin before  but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine  and that nobody ever came to visit them  and that for the first time in six years  when she heard us play  she stopped shaking without medication. Suddenly  what we're finding with these concerts  away from the stage  away from the footlights  out of the tuxedo tails  the musicians become the conduit for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room  would never have access to the kind of music that we make. Just as medicine serves to heal more than the building blocks of the body alone  the power and beauty of music transcends the  E  in the middle of our beloved acronym. Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone. The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by Wagner  or a symphony by Brahms  or chamber music by Beethoven  compels us to remember our shared  common humanity  the deeply communal connected consciousness  the empathic consciousness that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard wired into our brain's right hemisphere. And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within homelessness and incarceration  the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them  to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them. And the spark of that beauty  the spark of that humanity transforms into hope  and we know  whether we choose the path of music or of medicine  that's the very first thing we must instill within our communities  within our audiences  if we want to inspire healing from within. I'd like to end with a quote by John Keats  the Romantic English poet  a very famous quote that I'm sure all of you know. Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry  but he died when he was a year older than me. And Keats said   Beauty is truth  and truth beauty. That is all ye know on Earth  and all ye need to know.  We most certainly do talk to terrorists  no question about it. We are at war with a new form of terrorism. It's sort of the good old  traditional form of terrorism  but it's sort of been packaged for the   st century. One of the big things about countering terrorism is  how do you perceive it  Because perception leads to your response to it. So if you have a traditional perception of terrorism  it would be that it's one of criminality  one of war. So how are you going to respond to it  Naturally  it would follow that you meet kind with kind. You fight it. If you have a more modernist approach  and your perception of terrorism is almost cause and effect  then naturally from that  the responses that come out of it are much more asymmetrical. We live in a modern  global world. Terrorists have actually adapted to it. It's something we have to  too  and that means the people who are working on counterterrorism responses have to start  in effect  putting on their Google tinted glasses  or whatever. For my part  what I wanted us to do was just to look at terrorism as though it was a global brand  say  Coca Cola. Both are fairly bad for your health.  Laughter  If you look at it as a brand in those ways  what you'll come to realize is  it's a pretty flawed product. As we've said  it's pretty bad for your health  it's bad for those who it affects  and it's not actually good if you're a suicide bomber either. It doesn't actually do what it says on the tin. You're not really going to get    virgins in heaven. It's not going to happen  I don't think. And you're not really going to  in the '  s  end capitalism by supporting one of these groups. It's a load of nonsense. But what you realize  it's got an Achilles' heel. The brand has an Achilles' heel. We've mentioned the health  but it needs consumers to buy into it. The consumers it needs are the terrorist constituency. They're the people who buy into the brand  support them  facilitate them  and they're the people we've got to reach out to. We've got to attack that brand in front of them. There's two essential ways of doing that  if we carry on this brand theme. One is reducing their market. What I mean is  it's their brand against our brand. We've got to compete. We've got to show we're a better product. If I'm trying to show we're a better product  I probably wouldn't do things like Guantanamo Bay. We've talked there about curtailing the underlying need for the product itself. You could be looking there at poverty  injustice  all those sorts of things which feed terrorism. The other thing to do is to knock the product  attack the brand myth  as we've said. You know  there's nothing heroic about killing a young kid. Perhaps we need to focus on that and get that message back across. We've got to reveal the dangers in the product. Our target audience  it's not just the producers of terrorism  as I've said  the terrorists. It's not just the marketeers of terrorism  which is those who finance  those who facilitate it  but it's the consumers of terrorism. We've got to get in to those homelands. That's where they recruit from. That's where they get their power and strength. That's where their consumers come from. And we have to get our messaging in there. So the essentials are  we've got to have interaction in those areas  with the terrorists  the facilitators  etc. We've got to engage  we've got to educate  and we've got to have dialogue. Now  staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds  think about delivery mechanisms. How are we going to do these attacks  Well  reducing the market is really one for governments and civil society. We've got to show we're better. We've got to show our values. We've got to practice what we preach. But when it comes to knocking the brand  if the terrorists are Coca Cola and we're Pepsi  I don't think  being Pepsi  anything we say about Coca Cola  anyone's going to believe us. So we've got to find a different mechanism  and one of the best mechanisms I've ever come across is the victims of terrorism. They are somebody who can actually stand there and say   This product's crap. I had it and I was sick for days. It burnt my hand  whatever.  You believe them. You can see their scars. You trust them. But whether it's victims  whether it's governments  NGOs  or even the Queen yesterday  in Northern Ireland  we have to interact and engage with those different layers of terrorism  and  in effect  we do have to have a little dance with the devil. This is my favorite part of my speech. I wanted to blow you all up to try and make a point  but    Laughter    TED  for health and safety reasons  have told me I've got to do a countdown  so I feel like a bit of an Irish or Jewish terrorist  sort of a health and safety terrorist  and I    Laughter    I've got to count          and it's a bit alarming  so thinking of what my motto would be  and it would be   Body parts  not heart attacks.  So        .  Explosion sound  Very good.  Laughter  Now  lady in   J was a suicide bomber amongst us all. We're all victims of terrorism. There's     of us in this room. We're going to be scarred for life. There was a father and a son who sat in that seat over there. The son's dead. The father lives. The father will probably kick himself for years to come that he didn't take that seat instead of his kid. He's going to take to alcohol  and he's probably going to kill himself in three years. That's the stats. There's a very young  attractive lady over here  and she has something which I think's the worst form of psychological  physical injury I've ever seen out of a suicide bombing  It's human shrapnel. What it means is  when she sat in a restaurant in years to come     years to come     years to come  or she's on the beach  every so often she's going to start rubbing her skin  and out of there will come a piece of that shrapnel. And that is a hard thing for the head to take. There's a lady over there as well who lost her legs in this bombing. She's going to find out that she gets a pitiful amount of money off our government for looking after what's happened to her. She had a daughter who was going to go to one of the best universities. She's going to give up university to look after Mum. We're all here  and all of those who watch it are going to be traumatized by this event  but all of you here who are victims are going to learn some hard truths. That is  our society  we sympathize  but after a while  we start to ignore. We don't do enough as a society. We do not look after our victims  and we do not enable them  and what I'm going to try and show is that actually  victims are the best weapon we have against more terrorism. How would the government at the turn of the millennium approach today  Well  we all know. What they'd have done then is an invasion. If the suicide bomber was from Wales  good luck to Wales  I'd say. Knee jerk legislation  emergency provision legislation    which hits at the very basis of our society  as we all know    it's a mistake. We're going to drive prejudice throughout Edinburgh  throughout the U.K.  for Welsh people. Today's approach  governments have learned from their mistakes. They are looking at what I've started off on  on these more asymmetrical approaches to it  more modernist views  cause and effect. But mistakes of the past are inevitable. It's human nature. The fear and the pressure to do something on them is going to be immense. They are going to make mistakes. They're not just going to be smart. There was a famous Irish terrorist who once summed up the point very beautifully. He said   The thing is  about the British government  is  is that it's got to be lucky all the time  and we only have to be lucky once.  So what we need to do is we have to effect it. We've got to start thinking about being more proactive. We need to build an arsenal of noncombative weapons in this war on terrorism. But of course  it's ideas    is not something that governments do very well. I want to go back just to before the bang  to this idea of brand  and I was talking about Coke and Pepsi  etc. We see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war. They'll see it as freedom fighters and truth against injustice  imperialism  etc. We do have to see this as a deadly battlefield. It's not just  our  flesh and blood they want. They actually want our cultural souls  and that's why the brand analogy is a very interesting way of looking at this. If we look at al Qaeda. Al Qaeda was essentially a product on a shelf in a souk somewhere which not many people had heard of.      launched it. It was its big marketing day  and it was packaged for the   st century. They knew what they were doing. They were effectively  doing  something in this brand image of creating a brand which can be franchised around the world  where there's poverty  ignorance and injustice. We  as I've said  have got to hit that market  but we've got to use our heads rather than our might. If we perceive it in this way as a brand  or other ways of thinking at it like this  we will not resolve or counter terrorism. What I'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples from my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently. The first one has been dubbed  lawfare   for want of a better word. When we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists  everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks and crackpots. Now it's got a title. Everyone's doing it. There's a bomb  people start suing. But one of the first early cases on this was the Omagh Bombing. A civil action was brought from     . In Omagh  bomb went off  Real IRA  middle of a peace process. That meant that the culprits couldn't really be prosecuted for lots of reasons  mostly to do with the peace process and what was going on  the greater good. It also meant  then  if you can imagine this  that the people who bombed your children and your husbands were walking around the supermarket that you lived in. Some of those victims said enough is enough. We brought a private action  and thank God     years later  we actually won it. There is a slight appeal on at the moment so I have to be a bit careful  but I'm fairly confident. Why was it effective  It was effective not just because justice was seen to be done where there was a huge void. It was because the Real IRA and other terrorist groups  their whole strength is from the fact that they are an underdog. When we put the victims as the underdog and flipped it  they didn't know what to do. They were embarrassed. Their recruitment went down. The bombs actually stopped    fact    because of this action. We became  or those victims became  more importantly  a ghost that haunted the terrorist organization. There's other examples. We have a case called Almog which is to do with a bank that was  allegedly  from our point of view  giving rewards to suicide bombers. Just by bringing the very action  that bank has stopped doing it  and indeed  the powers that be around the world  which for real politic reasons before  couldn't actually deal with this issue  because there was lots of competing interests  have actually closed down those loopholes in the banking system. There's another case called the McDonald case  where some victims of Semtex  of the Provisional IRA bombings  which were supplied by Gaddafi  sued  and that action has led to amazing things for new Libya. New Libya has been compassionate towards those victims  and started taking it    so it started a whole new dialogue there. But the problem is  we need more and more support for these ideas and cases. Civil affairs and civil society initiatives. A good one is in Somalia. There's a war on piracy. If anyone thinks you can have a war on piracy like a war on terrorism and beat it  you're wrong. What we're trying to do there is turn pirates to fisherman. They used to be fisherman  of course  but we stole their fish and dumped a load of toxic waste in their water  so what we're trying to do is create security and employment by bringing a coastguard along with the fisheries industry  and I can guarantee you  as that builds  al Shabaab and such likes will not have the poverty and injustice any longer to prey on those people. These initiatives cost less than a missile  and certainly less than any soldier's life  but more importantly  it takes the war to their homelands  and not onto our shore  and we're looking at the causes. The last one I wanted to talk about was dialogue. The advantages of dialogue are obvious. It self educates both sides  enables a better understanding  reveals the strengths and weaknesses  and yes  like some of the speakers before  the shared vulnerability does lead to trust  and it does then become  that process  part of normalization. But it's not an easy road. After the bomb  the victims are not into this. There's practical problems. It's politically risky for the protagonists and for the interlocutors. On one occasion I was doing it  every time I did a point that they didn't like  they actually threw stones at me  and when I did a point they liked  they starting shooting in the air  equally not great.  Laughter  Whatever the point  it gets to the heart of the problem  you're doing it  you're talking to them. Now  I just want to end with saying  if we follow reason  we realize that I think we'd all say that we want to have a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure military perception of it. We need to foster more modern and asymmetrical responses to it. This isn't about being soft on terrorism. It's about fighting them on contemporary battlefields. We must foster innovation  as I've said. Governments are receptive. It won't come from those dusty corridors. The private sector has a role. The role we could do right now is going away and looking at how we can support victims around the world to bring initiatives. If I was to leave you with some big questions here which may change one's perception to it  and who knows what thoughts and responses will come out of it  but did myself and my terrorist group actually need to blow you up to make our point  We have to ask ourselves these questions  however unpalatable. Have we been ignoring an injustice or a humanitarian struggle somewhere in the world  What if  actually  engagement on poverty and injustice is exactly what the terrorists wanted us to do  What if the bombs are just simply wake up calls for us  What happens if that bomb went off because we didn't have any thoughts and things in place to allow dialogue to deal with these things and interaction  What is definitely uncontroversial is that  as I've said  we've got to stop being reactive  and more proactive  and I just want to leave you with one idea  which is that it's a provocative question for you to think about  and the answer will require sympathy with the devil. It's a question that's been tackled by many great thinkers and writers  What if society actually needs crisis to change  What if society actually needs terrorism to change and adapt for the better  It's those Bulgakov themes  it's that picture of Jesus and the Devil hand in hand in Gethsemane walking into the moonlight. What it would mean is that humans  in order to survive in development  quite Darwinian spirit here  inherently must dance with the devil. A lot of people say that communism was defeated by the Rolling Stones. It's a good theory. Maybe the Rolling Stones has a place in this. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you.  Applause  So  this is my grandfather  Salman Schocken  who was born into a poor and uneducated family with six children to feed  and when he was    years old  he was forced to drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table. He never went back to school. Instead  he went on to build a glittering empire of department stores. Salman was the consummate perfectionist  and every one of his stores was a jewel of Bauhaus architecture. He was also the ultimate self learner  and like everything else  he did it in grand style. He surrounded himself with an entourage of young  unknown scholars like Martin Buber and Shai Agnon and Franz Kafka  and he paid each one of them a monthly salary so that they could write in peace. And yet  in the late '  s  Salman saw what's coming. He fled Germany  together with his family  leaving everything else behind. His department stores confiscated  he spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit of art and culture. This high school dropout died at the age of     a formidable intellectual  cofounder and first CEO of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem  and founder of Schocken Books  an acclaimed imprint that was later acquired by Random House. Such is the power of self study. And these are my parents. They too did not enjoy the privilege of college education. They were too busy building a family and a country. And yet  just like Salman  they were lifelong  tenacious self learners  and our home was stacked with thousands of books  records and artwork. I remember quite vividly my father telling me that when everyone in the neighborhood will have a TV set  then we'll buy a normal F.M. radio.  Laughter  And that's me  I was going to say holding my first abacus  but actually holding what my father would consider an ample substitute to an iPad.  Laughter  So one thing that I took from home is this notion that educators don't necessarily have to teach. Instead  they can provide an environment and resources that tease out your natural ability to learn on your own. Self study  self exploration  self empowerment  these are the virtues of a great education. So I'd like to share with you a story about a self study  self empowering computer science course that I built  together with my brilliant colleague Noam Nisan. As you can see from the pictures  both Noam and I had an early fascination with first principles  and over the years  as our knowledge of science and technology became more sophisticated  this early awe with the basics has only intensified. So it's not surprising that  about    years ago  when Noam and I were already computer science professors  we were equally frustrated by the same phenomenon. As computers became increasingly more complex  our students were losing the forest for the trees  and indeed  it is impossible to connect with the soul of the machine if you interact with a black box P.C. or a Mac which is shrouded by numerous layers of closed  proprietary software. So Noam and I had this insight that if we want our students to understand how computers work  and understand it in the marrow of their bones  then perhaps the best way to go about it is to have them build a complete  working  general purpose  useful computer  hardware and software  from the ground up  from first principles. Now  we had to start somewhere  and so Noam and I decided to base our cathedral  so to speak  on the simplest possible building block  which is something called NAND. It is nothing more than a trivial logic gate with four input output states. So we now start this journey by telling our students that God gave us NAND    Laughter    and told us to build a computer  and when we asked how  God said   One step at a time.  And then  following this advice  we start with this lowly  humble NAND gate  and we walk our students through an elaborate sequence of projects in which they gradually build a chip set  a hardware platform  an assembler  a virtual machine  a basic operating system and a compiler for a simple  Java like language that we call  JACK.  The students celebrate the end of this tour de force by using JACK to write all sorts of cool games like Pong  Snake and Tetris. You can imagine the tremendous joy of playing with a Tetris game that you wrote in JACK and then compiled into machine language in a compiler that you wrote also  and then seeing the result running on a machine that you built starting with nothing more than a few thousand NAND gates. It's a tremendous personal triumph of going from first principles all the way to a fantastically complex and useful system. Noam and I worked five years to facilitate this ascent and to create the tools and infrastructure that will enable students to build it in one semester. And this is the great team that helped us make it happen. The trick was to decompose the computer's construction into numerous stand alone modules  each of which could be individually specified  built and unit tested in isolation from the rest of the project. And from day one  Noam and I decided to put all these building blocks freely available in open source on the Web. So chip specifications  APIs  project descriptions  software tools  hardware simulators  CPU emulators  stacks of hundreds of slides  lectures    we laid out everything on the Web and invited the world to come over  take whatever they need  and do whatever they want with it. And then something fascinating happened. The world came. And in short order  thousands of people were building our machine. And NAND Tetris became one of the first massive  open  online courses  although seven years ago we had no idea that what we were doing is called MOOCs. We just observed how self organized courses were kind of spontaneously spawning out of our materials. For example  Pramode C.E.  an engineer from Kerala  India  has organized groups of self learners who build our computer under his good guidance. And Parag Shah  another engineer  from Mumbai  has unbundled our projects into smaller  more manageable bites that he now serves in his pioneering do it yourself computer science program. The people who are attracted to these courses typically have a hacker mentality. They want to figure out how things work  and they want to do it in groups  like this hackers club in Washington  D.C.  that uses our materials to offer community courses. And because these materials are widely available and open source  different people take them to very different and unpredictable directions. For example  Yu Fangmin  from Guangzhou  has used FPGA technology to build our computer and show others how to do the same using a video clip  and Ben Craddock developed a very nice computer game that unfolds inside our CPU architecture  which is quite a complex  D maze that Ben developed using the Minecraft  D simulator engine. The Minecraft community went bananas over this project  and Ben became an instant media celebrity. And indeed  for quite a few people  taking this NAND Tetris pilgrimage  if you will  has turned into a life changing experience. For example  take Dan Rounds  who is a music and math major from East Lansing  Michigan. A few weeks ago  Dan posted a victorious post on our website  and I'd like to read it to you. So here's what Dan said.  I did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me  just like literacy and numeracy  and I made it through. I never worked harder on anything  never been challenged to this degree. But given what I now feel capable of doing  I would certainly do it again. To anyone considering NAND Tetris  it's a tough journey  but you'll be profoundly changed.  So Dan demonstrates the many self learners who take this course off the Web  on their own traction  on their own initiative  and it's quite amazing because these people cannot care less about grades. They are doing it because of one motivation only. They have a tremendous passion to learn. And with that in mind  I'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading. I'm sick of it. We are obsessed with grades because we are obsessed with data  and yet grading takes away all the fun from failing  and a huge part of education is about failing. Courage  according to Churchill  is the ability to go from one defeat to another without losing enthusiasm.  Laughter  And  Joyce  said that mistakes are the portals of discovery. And yet we don't tolerate mistakes  and we worship grades. So we collect your B pluses and your A minuses and we aggregate them into a number like  .   which is stamped on your forehead and sums up who you are. Well  in my opinion  we went too far with this nonsense  and grading became degrading. So with that  I'd like to say a few words about upgrading  and share with you a glimpse from my current project  which is different from the previous one  but it shares exactly the same characteristics of self learning  learning by doing  self exploration and community building  and this project deals with K    math education  beginning with early age math  and we do it on tablets because we believe that math  like anything else  should be taught hands on. So here's what we do. Basically  we developed numerous mobile apps  every one of them explaining a particular concept in math. So for example  let's take area. When you deal with a concept like area    well  we also provide a set of tools that the child is invited to experiment with in order to learn. So if area is what interests us  then one thing which is natural to do is to tile the area of this particular shape and simply count how many tiles it takes to cover it completely. And this little exercise here gives you a first good insight of the notion of area. Moving along  what about the area of this figure  Well  if you try to tile it  it doesn't work too well  does it. So instead  you can experiment with these different tools here by some process of guided trial and error  and at some point you will discover that one thing that you can do among several legitimate transformations is the following one. You can cut the figure  you can rearrange the parts  you can glue them and then proceed to tile just like we did before. Now this particular transformation did not change the area of the original figure  so a six year old who plays with this has just discovered a clever algorithm to compute the area of any given parallelogram. We don't replace teachers  by the way. We believe that teachers should be empowered  not replaced. Moving along  what about the area of a triangle  So after some guided trial and error  the child will discover  with or without help  that he or she can duplicate the original figure and then take the result  transpose it  glue it to the original and then proceed  with  what we did before  cut  rearrange  paste   oops  paste and glue  and tile. Now this transformation has doubled the area of the original figure  and therefore we have just learned that the area of the triangle equals the area of this rectangle divided by two. But we discovered it by self exploration. So  in addition to learning some useful geometry  the child has been exposed to some pretty sophisticated science strategies  like reduction  which is the art of transforming a complex problem into a simple one  or generalization  which is at the heart of any scientific discipline  or the fact that some properties are invariant under some transformations. And all this is something that a very young child can pick up using such mobile apps. So presently  we are doing the following  First of all  we are decomposing the K    math curriculum into numerous such apps. And because we cannot do it on our own  we've developed a very fancy authoring tool that any author  any parent or actually anyone who has an interest in math education  can use this authoring tool to develop similar apps on tablets without programming. And finally  we are putting together an adaptive ecosystem that will match different learners with different apps according to their evolving learning style. The driving force behind this project is my colleague Shmulik London  and  you see  just like Salman did about    years ago  the trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people  because at the end  it's all about people. And a few years ago  I was walking in Tel Aviv and I saw this graffiti on a wall  and I found it so compelling that by now I preach it to my students  and I'd like to try to preach it to you. Now  I don't know how many people here are familiar with the term  mensch.  It basically means to be human and to do the right thing. And with that  what this graffiti says is   High tech schmigh tech. The most important thing is to be a mensch.   Laughter  Thank you.  Applause  When I was considering a career in the art world  I took a course in London  and one of my supervisors was this irascible Italian called Pietro  who drank too much  smoked too much and swore much too much. But he was a passionate teacher  and I remember one of our earlier classes with him  he was projecting images on the wall  asking us to think about them  and he put up an image of a painting. It was a landscape with figures  semi dressed  drinking wine. There was a nude woman in the lower foreground  and on the hillside in the back  there was a figure of the mythological god Bacchus  and he said   What is this   And I    no one else did  so I put up my hand  and I said   It's a Bacchanal by Titian.  He said   It's a what   I thought maybe I'd pronounced it wrong.  It's a Bacchanal by Titian.  He said   It's a what   I said   It's a Bacchanal by Titian.   Laughter  He said   You boneless bookworm  It's a fucking orgy   As I said  he swore too much. There was an important lesson for me in that. Pietro was suspicious of formal art training  art history training  because he feared that it filled people up with jargon  and then they just classified things rather than looking at them  and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary  and he wanted us to use our eyes  and he was especially evangelical about this message  because he was losing his sight. He wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects. What is it  How is it made  Why was it made  How is it used  And these were important lessons to me when I subsequently became a professional art historian. My kind of eureka moment came a few years later  when I was studying the art of the courts of Northern Europe  and of course it was very much discussed in terms of the paintings and the sculptures and the architecture of the day. But as I began to read historical documents and contemporary descriptions  I found there was a kind of a missing component  for everywhere I came across descriptions of tapestries. Tapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages and  really  well into the   th century  and it was pretty apparent why. Tapestries were portable. You could roll them up  send them ahead of you  and in the time it took to hang them up  you could transform a cold  dank interior into a richly colored setting. Tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be associated  or even themselves  and in addition to that  tapestries were hugely expensive. They required scores of highly skilled weavers working over extended periods of time with very expensive materials    the wools  the silks  even gold and silver thread. So  all in all  in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare  tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda. Well  I became a tapestry historian. In due course  I ended up as a curator at the Metropolitan Museum  because I saw the Met as one of the few places where I could organize really big exhibitions about the subject I cared so passionately about. And in about       the then director Philippe de Montebello gave me the go ahead to organize an exhibition for     . We normally have these very long lead in times. It wasn't straightforward. It's no longer a question of chucking a tapestry in the back of a car. They have to be wound on huge rollers  shipped in oversized freighters. Some of them are so big we had  to get them into the museum  we had to take them up the great steps at the front. We thought very hard about how to present this unknown subject to a modern audience  the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded  the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread  the labeling. You know  we live in an age where we are so used to television images and photographs  a one hit image. These were big  complex things  almost like cartoons with multiple narratives. We had to draw our audience in  get them to slow down  to explore the objects. There was a lot of skepticism. On the opening night  I overheard one of the senior members of staff saying   This is going to be a bomb.  But in reality  in the course of the coming weeks and months  hundreds of thousands of people came to see the show. The exhibition was designed to be an experience  and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs. So I want you to use your imaginations  thinking of these wall high objects  some of them    meters wide  depicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies who would look quite at home in the pages of the fashion press today  thick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth in pursuit of wild boars and deer  violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism. I remember taking my son's school class. He was eight at the time  and all the little boys  they kind of    you know  they were little boys  and then the thing that caught their attention was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog pooping in the foreground    Laughter    kind of an in your face joke by the artist. And you can just imagine them. But it brought it alive to them. I think they suddenly saw that these weren't just old faded tapestries. These were images of the world in the past  and that it was the same for our audience. And for me as a curator  I felt proud. I felt I'd shifted the needle a little. Through this experience that could only be created in a museum  I'd opened up the eyes of my audience    historians  artists  press  the general public    to the beauty of this lost medium. A few years later  I was invited to be the director of the museum  and after I got over that     Who  me  The tapestry geek  I don't wear a tie      I realized the fact  I believe passionately in that curated museum experience. We live in an age of ubiquitous information  and sort of  just add water  expertise  but there's nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well told narrative  what the curator does  the interpretation of a complex  esoteric subject  in a way that retains the integrity of the subject  that makes it    unpacks it for a general audience. And that  to me  today  is now the challenge and the fun of my job  supporting the vision of my curators  whether it's an exhibition of Samurai swords  early Byzantine artifacts  Renaissance portraits  or the show we heard mentioned earlier  the McQueen show  with which we enjoyed so much success last summer. That was an interesting case. In the late spring  early summer of       shortly after McQueen's suicide  our curator of costume  Andrew Bolton  came to see me  and said   I've been thinking of doing a show on McQueen  and now is the moment. We have to  we have to do it fast.  It wasn't easy. McQueen had worked throughout his career with a small team of designers and managers who were very protective of his legacy  but Andrew went to London and worked with them over the summer and won their confidence  and that of the designers who created his amazing fashion shows  which were works of performance art in their own right  and we proceeded to do something at the museum  I think  we've never done before. It wasn't just your standard installation. In fact  we ripped down the galleries to recreate entirely different settings  a recreation of his first studio  a hall of mirrors  a curiosity box  a sunken ship  a burned out interior  with videos and soundtracks that ranged from operatic arias to pigs fornicating. And in this extraordinary setting  the costumes were like actors and actresses  or living sculptures. It could have been a train wreck. It could have looked like shop windows on Fifth Avenue at Christmas  but because of the way that Andrew connected with the McQueen team  he was channeling the rawness and the brilliance of McQueen  and the show was quite transcendant  and it became a phenomenon in its own right. By the end of the show  we had people queuing for four or five hours to get into the show  but no one really complained. I heard over and over again   Wow  that was worth it. It was a such a visceral  emotive experience.  Now  I've described two very immersive exhibitions  but I also believe that collections  individual objects  can also have that same power. The Met was set up not as a museum of American art  but of an encyclopedic museum  and today      years later  that vision is as prescient as ever  because  of course  we live in a world of crisis  of challenge  and we're exposed to it through the      newsreels. It's in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations  the cultures  that we're seeing the current manifestation of. Whether it's Libya  Egypt  Syria  it's in our galleries that we can explain and give greater understanding. I mean  our new Islamic galleries are a case in point  opened    years  almost to the week  after     . I think for most Americans  knowledge of the Islamic world was pretty slight before       and then it was thrust upon us in one of America's darkest hours  and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event. Now  in our galleries  we show    centuries of the development of different Islamic cultures across a vast geographic spread  and  again  hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last October. I'm often asked   Is digital media replacing the museum   and I think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion. I mean  don't get me wrong  I'm a huge advocate of the Web. It gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe  but nothing replaces the authenticity of the object presented with passionate scholarship. Bringing people face to face with our objects is a way of bringing them face to face with people across time  across space  whose lives may have been very different to our own  but who  like us  had hopes and dreams  frustrations and achievements in their lives. And I think this is a process that helps us better understand ourselves  helps us make better decisions about where we're going. The Great Hall at the Met is one of the great portals of the world  awe inspiring  like a medieval cathedral. From there  you can walk in any direction to almost any culture. I frequently go out into the hall and the galleries and I watch our visitors coming in. Some of them are comfortable. They feel at home. They know what they're looking for. Others are very uneasy. It's an intimidating place. They feel that the institution is elitist. I'm working to try and break down that sense of that elitism. I want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind  where they're prepared to be a little bit lost  to explore  to see the unfamiliar in the familiar  or to try the unknown. Because for us  it's all about bringing them face to face with great works of art  capturing them at that moment of discomfort  when the inclination is kind of to reach for your iPhone  your Blackberry  but to create a zone where their curiosity can expand. And whether it's in the expression of a Greek sculpture that reminds you of a friend  or a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry  or  to bring it back to my tutor Pietro  those dancing figures who are indeed knocking back the wine  and that nude figure in the left foreground. Wow. She is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality. In that moment  our scholarship can tell you that this is a bacchanal  but if we're doing our job right  and you've checked the jargon at the front door  trust your instinct. You know it's an orgy. Thank you.  Applause  Companies are losing control. What happens on Wall Street no longer stays on Wall Street. What happens in Vegas ends up on YouTube.  Laughter  Reputations are volatile. Loyalties are fickle. Management teams seem increasingly disconnected from their staff.  Laughter  A recent survey said that    percent of bosses believe their employees are inspired by their firm. However  in the same survey  only four percent of employees agreed. Companies are losing control of their customers and their employees. But are they really  I'm a marketer  and as a marketer  I know that I've never really been in control. Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room  the saying goes. Hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companies to be in that room now      . They can listen and join the conversation. In fact  they have more control over the loss of control than ever before. They can design for it. But how  First of all  they can give employees and customers more control. They can collaborate with them on the creation of ideas  knowledge  content  designs and product. They can give them more control over pricing  which is what the band Radiohead did with its pay as you like online release of its album  In Rainbows.  Buyers could determine the price  but the offer was exclusive  and only stood for a limited period of time. The album sold more copies than previous releases of the band. The Danish chocolate company Anthon Berg opened a so called  generous store  in Copenhagen. It asked customers to purchase chocolate with the promise of good deeds towards loved ones. It turned transactions into interactions  and generosity into a currency. Companies can even give control to hackers. When Microsoft Kinect came out  the motion controlled add on to its Xbox gaming console  it immediately drew the attention of hackers. Microsoft first fought off the hacks  but then shifted course when it realized that actively supporting the community came with benefits. The sense of co ownership  the free publicity  the added value  all helped drive sales. The ultimate empowerment of customers is to ask them not to buy. Outdoor clothier Patagonia encouraged prospective buyers to check out eBay for its used products and to resole their shoes before purchasing new ones. In an even more radical stance against consumerism  the company placed a  Don't Buy This Jacket  advertisement during the peak of shopping season. It may have jeopardized short term sales  but it builds lasting  long term loyalty based on shared values. Research has shown that giving employees more control over their work makes them happier and more productive. The Brazilian company Semco Group famously lets employees set their own work schedules and even their salaries. Hulu and Netflix  among other companies  have open vacation policies. Companies can give people more control  but they can also give them less control. Traditional business wisdom holds that trust is earned by predictable behavior  but when everything is consistent and standardized  how do you create meaningful experiences  Giving people less control might be a wonderful way to counter the abundance of choice and make them happier. Take the travel service Nextpedition. Nextpedition turns the trip into a game  with surprising twists and turns along the way. It does not tell the traveler where she's going until the very last minute  and information is provided just in time. Similarly  Dutch airline KLM launched a surprise campaign  seemingly randomly handing out small gifts to travelers en route to their destination. U.K. based Interflora monitored Twitter for users who were having a bad day  and then sent them a free bouquet of flowers. Is there anything companies can do to make their employees feel less pressed for time  Yes. Force them to help others. A recent study suggests that having employees complete occasional altruistic tasks throughout the day increases their sense of overall productivity. At Frog  the company I work for  we hold internal speed meet sessions that connect old and new employees  helping them get to know each other fast. By applying a strict process  we give them less control  less choice  but we enable more and richer social interactions. Companies are the makers of their fortunes  and like all of us  they are utterly exposed to serendipity. That should make them more humble  more vulnerable and more human. At the end of the day  as hyperconnectivity and transparency expose companies' behavior in broad daylight  staying true to their true selves is the only sustainable value proposition. Or as the ballet dancer Alonzo King said   What's interesting about you is you.  For the true selves of companies to come through  openness is paramount  but radical openness is not a solution  because when everything is open  nothing is open.  A smile is a door that is half open and half closed   the author Jennifer Egan wrote. Companies can give their employees and customers more control or less. They can worry about how much openness is good for them  and what needs to stay closed. Or they can simply smile  and remain open to all possibilities. Thank you.  Applause  I have to say that I'm very glad to be here. I understand we have over    countries here  so that's a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries. In each country  I'm sure you have this thing called the parent teacher conference. Do you know about the parent teacher conference  Not the ones for your kids  but the one you had as a child  where your parents come to school and your teacher talks to your parents  and it's a little bit awkward. Well  I remember in third grade  I had this moment where my father  who never takes off from work  he's a classical blue collar  a working class immigrant person  going to school to see his son  how he's doing  and the teacher said to him  he said   You know  John is good at math and art.  And he kind of nodded  you know  The next day I saw him talking to a customer at our tofu store  and he said   You know  John's good at math.  And that always stuck with me all my life. Why didn't Dad say art  Why wasn't it okay  Why  It became a question my entire life  and that's all right  because being good at math meant he bought me a computer  and some of you remember this computer  this was my first computer. Who had an Apple II  Apple II users  very cool.  Applause  As you remember  the Apple II did nothing at all.  Laughter  You'd plug it in  you'd type in it and green text would come out. It would say you're wrong most of the time. That was the computer we knew. That computer is a computer that I learned about going to MIT  my father's dream. And at MIT  however  I learned about the computer at all levels  and after  I went to art school to get away from computers  and I began to think about the computer as more of a spiritual space of thinking. And I was influenced by performance art    so this is    years ago. I made a computer out of people. It was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment. I have a power manager  mouse driver  memory  etc.  and I built this in Kyoto  the old capital of Japan. It's a room broken in two halves. I've turned the computer on  and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk built out of cardboard  and it's put into the computer. And the floppy disk drive person wears it.  Laughter  She finds the first sector on the disk  and takes data off the disk and passes it off to  of course  the bus. So the bus diligently carries the data into the computer to the memory  to the CPU  the VRAM  etc.  and it's an actual working computer. That's a bus  really.  Laughter  And it looks kind of fast. That's a mouse driver  where it's XY.  Laughter  It looks like it's happening kind of quickly  but it's actually a very slow computer  and when I realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is  it made me wonder about computers and technology in general. And so I'm going to talk today about four things  really. The first three things are about how I've been curious about technology  design and art  and how they intersect  how they overlap  and also a topic that I've taken on since four years ago I became the President of Rhode Island School of Design  leadership. And I'll talk about how I've looked to combine these four areas into a kind of a synthesis  a kind of experiment. So starting from technology  technology is a wonderful thing. When that Apple II came out  it really could do nothing. It could show text and after we waited a bit  we had these things called images. Remember when images were first possible with a computer  those gorgeous  full color images  And then after a few years  we got CD quality sound. It was incredible. You could listen to sound on the computer. And then movies  via CD ROM. It was amazing. Remember that excitement  And then the browser appeared. The browser was great  but the browser was very primitive  very narrow bandwidth. Text first  then images  we waited  CD quality sound over the Net  then movies over the Internet. Kind of incredible. And then the mobile phone occurred  text  images  audio  video. And now we have iPhone  iPad  Android  with text  video  audio  etc. You see this little pattern here  We're kind of stuck in a loop  perhaps  and this sense of possibility from computing is something I've been questioning for the last    or so years  and have looked to design  as we understand most things  and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine. And I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson. Designers talk about the relationship between form and content  content and form. Now what does that mean  Well  content is the word up there  fear. It's a four letter word. It's a kind of a bad feeling word  fear. Fear is set in Light Helvetica  so it's not too stressful  and if you set it in Ultra Light Helvetica  it's like   Oh  fear  who cares   Right   Laughter  You take the same Ultra Light Helvetica and make it big  and like  whoa  that hurts. Fear. So you can see how you change the scale  you change the form. Content is the same  but you feel differently. You change the typeface to  like  this typeface  and it's kind of funny. It's like pirate typeface  like Captain Jack Sparrow typeface. Arr  Fear  Like  aww  that's not fearful. That's actually funny. Or fear like this  kind of a nightclub typeface.  Laughter  Like  we gotta go to Fear.  Laughter  It's  like  amazing  right   Laughter   Applause  It just changes the same content. Or you make it    The letters are separated apart  they're huddled together like on the deck of the Titanic  and you feel sorry for the letters  like  I feel the fear. You feel for them. Or you change the typeface to something like this. It's very classy. It's like that expensive restaurant  Fear. I can never get in there.  Laughter  It's just amazing  Fear. But that's form  content. If you just change one letter in that content  you get a much better word  much better content  free.  Free  is a great word. You can serve it almost any way. Free bold feels like Mandela free. It's like  yes  I can be free. Free even light feels kind of like  ah  I can breathe in free. It feels great. Or even free spread out  it's like  ah  I can breathe in free  so easily. And I can add in a blue gradient and a dove  and I have  like  Don Draper free.  Laughter  So you see that    form  content  design  it works that way. It's a powerful thing. It's like magic  almost  like the magicians we've seen at TED. It's magic. Design does that. And I've been curious about how design and technology intersect  and I'm going to show you some old work I never really show anymore  to give you a sense of what I used to do. So    yeah. So I made a lot of work in the '  s. This was a square that responds to sound. People ask me why I made that. It's not clear.  Laughter  But I thought it'd be neat for the square to respond to me  and my kids were small then  and my kids would play with these things  like   Aaah   you know  they would say   Daddy  aaah  aaah.  You know  like that. We'd go to a computer store  and they'd do the same thing. And they'd say   Daddy  why doesn't the computer respond to sound   And it was really at the time I was wondering why doesn't the computer respond to sound  So I made this as a kind of an experiment at the time. And then I spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this  and I stopped doing it because my students at MIT got so much better than myself  so I had to hang up my mouse. But in '    I made my last piece. It was in black and white  monochrome  fully monochrome  all in integer mathematics. It's called  Tap  Type  Write.  It's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary. It has    variations.  Typing noise  There's a shift. Ten variations. This is  like  spin the letter around. This is  like  a ring of letters.  Typing noises  This is    years old  so it's kind of a    Let's see  this is   I love the French film  The Red Balloon.  Great movie  right  I love that movie. So  this is sort of like a play on that.  Typing noises   Typewriter bell  It's peaceful  like that.  Laughter  I'll show this last one. This is about balance  you know. It's kind of stressful typing out  so if you type on this keyboard  you can  like  balance it out. If you hit G  life's okay  so I always say   Hit G  and it's going to be all right. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. So that was    years ago  and I was always on the periphery of art. By being President of RISD I've gone deep into art  and art is a wonderful thing  fine art  pure art. You know  when people say   I don't get art. I don't get it at all.  That means art is working  you know  It's like  art is supposed to be enigmatic  so when you say  like   I don't get it   like  oh  that's great.  Laughter  Art does that  because art is about asking questions  questions that may not be answerable. At RISD  we have this amazing facility called the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab. It has        samples of animal  bone  mineral  plants. You know  in Rhode Island  if an animal gets hit on the road  they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it. And why do we have this facility  Because at RISD  you have to look at the actual animal  the object  to understand its volume  to perceive it. At RISD  you're not allowed to draw from an image. And many people ask me  John  couldn't you just digitize all this  Make it all digital  Wouldn't it be better  And I often say  well  there's something good to how things used to be done. There's something very different about it  something we should figure out what is good about how we did it  even in this new era. And I have a good friend  he's a new media artist named Tota Hasegawa. He's based in London  no  actually it's in Tokyo  but when he was based in London  he had a game with his wife. He would go to antique shops  and the game was as such  When we look at an antique we want  we'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique  and if it's a good story  we'll buy it. So they'd go to an antique shop  and they'd look at this cup  and they'd say   Tell us about this cup.  And the shopkeeper would say   It's old.   Laughter   Tell us more.   Oh  it's really old.   Laughter  And he saw  over and over  the antique's value was all about it being old. And as a new media artist  he reflected  and said  you know  I've spent my whole career making new media art. People say   Wow  your art  what is it   It's new media. And he realized  it isn't about old or new. It's about something in between. It isn't about  old   the dirt   new   the cloud. It's about what is good. A combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at. You see it in all interesting art today  in all interesting businesses today. How we combine those two together to make good is very interesting. So art makes questions  and leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions. We aren't functioning so easily anymore. We aren't a simple authoritarian regime anymore. As an example of authoritarianism  I was in Russia one time traveling in St. Petersburg  at a national monument  and I saw this sign that says   Do Not Walk On The Grass   and I thought  oh  I mean  I speak English  and you're trying to single me out. That's not fair. But I found a sign for Russian speaking people  and it was the best sign ever to say no. It was like   No swimming  no hiking  no anything.  My favorite ones are  no plants.  Why would you bring a plant to a national monument  I'm not sure. And also  no love.   Laughter  So that is authoritarianism. And what is that  structurally  It's a hierarchy. We all know that a hierarchy is how we run many systems today  but as we know  it's been disrupted. It is now a network instead of a perfect tree. It's a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy. And that's kind of awkward. And so today  leaders are faced with how to lead differently  I believe. This is work I did with my colleague Becky Bermont on creative leadership. What can we learn from artists and designers for how to lead  Because in many senses  a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes. Someone who's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes. A traditional leader is always wanting to be right  whereas a creative leader hopes to be right. And this frame is important today  in this complex  ambiguous space  and artists and designers have a lot to teach us  I believe. And I had a show in London recently where my friends invited me to come to London for four days to sit in a sandbox  and I said great. And so I sat in a sandbox for four days straight  six hours every day  six minute appointments with anyone in London  and that was really bad. But I would listen to people  hear their issues  draw in the sand  try to figure things out  and it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing. You know  It's all these one on one meetings for like four days. And it felt kind of like being president  actually. I was like   Oh  this my job. President. I do a lot of meetings  you know   And by the end of the experience  I realized why I was doing this. It's because leaders  what we do is we connect improbable connections and hope something will happen  and in that room I found so many connections between people across all of London  and so leadership  connecting people  is the great question today. Whether you're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy  it's a wonderful design challenge. And one thing I've been doing is doing some research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective. Let me show you something I haven't shown anywhere  actually. So what this is  is a kind of a sketch  an application sketch I wrote in Python. You know how there's Photoshop  This is called Powershop  and the way it works is imagine an organization. You know  the CEO isn't ever at the top. The CEO's at the center of the organization. There may be different subdivisions in the organization  and you might want to look into different areas. For instance  green are areas doing well  red are areas doing poorly. You know  how do you  as the leader  scan  connect  make things happen  So for instance  you might open up a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there  and know that you know someone in Eco  over here  and these people here are in Eco  the people you might engage with as CEO  people going across the hierarchy. And part of the challenge of the CEO is to find connections across areas  and so you might look in R D  and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest  and it's a person important to engage. So you might want to  for instance  get a heads up display on how you're interacting with them. How many coffees do you have  How often are you calling them  emailing them  What is the tenor of their email  How is it working out  Leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy. You can also imagine using technology like from Luminoso  the guys from Cambridge who were looking at deep text analysis. What is the tenor of your communications  So these kind of systems  I believe  are important. They're targeted social media systems around leaders. And I believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design  because art and design lets you think like this  find different systems like this  and I've just begun thinking like this  so I'm glad to share that with you. So in closing  I want to thank all of you for your attention. Thanks very much.  Applause  One in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness  so if it was one  two  three  four  it's you  sir. You. Yeah.  Laughter  With the weird teeth. And you next to him.  Laughter  You know who you are. Actually  that whole row isn't right.  Laughter  That's not good. Hi. Yeah. Real bad. Don't even look at me.  Laughter  I am one of the one in four. Thank you. I think I inherit it from my mother  who  used to crawl around the house on all fours. She had two sponges in her hand  and then she had two tied to her knees. My mother was completely absorbent.  Laughter  And she would crawl around behind me going   Who brings footprints into a building    So that was kind of a clue that things weren't right. So before I start  I would like to thank the makers of Lamotrigine  Sertraline  and Reboxetine  because without those few simple chemicals  I would not be vertical today. So how did it start  My mental illness    well  I'm not even going to talk about my mental illness. What am I going to talk about  Okay. I always dreamt that  when I had my final breakdown  it would be because I had a deep Kafkaesque existentialist revelation  or that maybe Cate Blanchett would play me and she would win an Oscar for it.  Laughter  But that's not what happened. I had my breakdown during my daughter's sports day. There were all the parents sitting in a parking lot eating food out of the back of their car    only the English    eating their sausages. They loved their sausages.  Laughter  Lord and Lady Rigor Mortis were nibbling on the tarmac  and then the gun went off and all the girlies started running  and all the mummies went   Run  Run Chlamydia  Run    Laughter   Run like the wind  Veruca  Run   And all the girlies  girlies running  running  running  everybody except for my daughter  who was just standing at the starting line  just waving  because she didn't know she was supposed to run. So I took to my bed for about a month  and when I woke up I found I was institutionalized  and when I saw the other inmates  I realized that I had found my people  my tribe.  Laughter  Because they became my only friends  they became my friends  because very few people that I knew    Well  I wasn't sent a lot of cards or flowers. I mean  if I had had a broken leg or I was with child I would have been inundated  but all I got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up. Perk up. Because I didn't think of that.  Laughter  Because  you know  the one thing  one thing that you get with this disease  this one comes with a package  is you get a real sense of shame  because your friends go   Oh come on  show me the lump  show me the x rays   and of course you've got nothing to show  so you're  like  really disgusted with yourself because you're thinking   I'm not being carpet bombed. I don't live in a township.  So you start to hear these abusive voices  but you don't hear one abusive voice  you hear about a thousand            abusive voices  like if the Devil had Tourette's  that's what it would sound like. But we all know in here  you know  there is no Devil  there are no voices in your head. You know that when you have those abusive voices  all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real toxic  I want to kill myself  kind of chemical  and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape  you might have yourself depression. Oh  and that's not even the tip of the iceberg. If you get a little baby  and you abuse it verbally  its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive that the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn't grow  so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic. If a soldier sees his friend blown up  his brain goes into such high alarm that he can't actually put the experience into words  so he just feels the horror over and over again. So here's my question. My question is  how come when people have mental damage  it's always an active imagination  How come every other organ in your body can get sick and you get sympathy  except the brain  I'd like to talk a little bit more about the brain  because I know you like that here at TED  so if you just give me a minute here  okay. Okay  let me just say  there's some good news. There is some good news. First of all  let me say  we've come a long  long way. We started off as a teeny  teeny little one celled amoeba  tiny  just sticking onto a rock  and now  voila  the brain. Here we go.  Laughter  This little baby has a lot of horsepower. It comes completely conscious. It's got state of the art lobes. We've got the occipital lobe so we can actually see the world. We got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world. Here we've got a little bit of long term memory  so  you know that night you want to forget  when you got really drunk  Bye bye  Gone.  Laughter  So actually  it's filled with     billion neurons just zizzing away  electrically transmitting information  zizzing  zizzing. I'm going to give you a little side view here. I don't know if you can get that here.  Laughter  So  zizzing away  and so    Laughter    And for every one   I know  I drew this myself. Thank you. For every one single neuron  you can actually have from        to         different connections or dendrites or whatever you want to call it  and every time you learn something  or you have an experience  that bush grows  you know  that bush of information. Can you imagine  every human being is carrying that equipment  even Paris Hilton   Laughter  Go figure. But I got a little bad news for you folks. I got some bad news. This isn't for the one in four. This is for the four in four. We are not equipped for the   st century. Evolution did not prepare us for this. We just don't have the bandwidth  and for people who say  oh  they're having a nice day  they're perfectly fine  they're more insane than the rest of us. Because I'll show you where there might be a few glitches in evolution. Okay  let me just explain this to you. When we were ancient man    Laughter    millions of years ago  and we suddenly felt threatened by a predator  okay     Laughter    we would   Thank you. I drew these myself.  Laughter  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Anyway  we would fill up with our own adrenaline and our own cortisol  and then we'd kill or be killed  we'd eat or we'd be eaten  and then suddenly we'd de fuel  and we'd go back to normal. Okay. So the problem is  nowadays  with modern man   Laughter    when we feel in danger  we still fill up with our own chemical but because we can't kill traffic wardens    Laughter    or eat estate agents  the fuel just stays in our body over and over  so we're in a constant state of alarm  a constant state. And here's another thing that happened. About         years ago  when language came online  we started to put words to this constant emergency  so it wasn't just   Oh my God  there's a saber toothed tiger   which could be  it was suddenly   Oh my God  I didn't send the email. Oh my God  my thighs are too fat. Oh my God  everybody can see I'm stupid. I didn't get invited to the Christmas party   So you've got this nagging loop tape that goes over and over again that drives you insane  so  you see what the problem is  What once made you safe now drives you insane. I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news  but somebody has to be. Your pets are happier than you are.  Laughter  So kitty cat  meow  happy happy happy  human beings  screwed.  Laughter  Completely and utterly    so  screwed. But my point is  if we don't talk about this stuff  and we don't learn how to deal with our lives  it's not going to be one in four. It's going to be four in four who are really  really going to get ill in the upstairs department. And while we're at it  can we please stop the stigma  Thank you.  Applause  Five years ago  I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland. Penn State asked me  a communications teacher  to teach a communications class for engineering students. And I was scared.  Laughter  Really scared. Scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big  unfamiliar words. But as these conversations unfolded  I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world. That's just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students. I was amazed at the ideas that they had  and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well. And I believe the key to opening that door is great communication. We desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world. Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges  from energy to environment to health care  among others  and if we don't know about it and understand it  then the work isn't done  and I believe it's our responsibility as non scientists to have these interactions. But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland. So scientists and engineers  please  talk nerdy to us. I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging. First question to answer for us  so what  Tell us why your science is relevant to us. Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae  but tell me that you study trabeculae  which is the mesh like structure of our bones because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis. And when you're describing your science  beware of jargon. Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas. Sure  you can say  spatial and temporal   but why not just say  space and time   which is so much more accessible to us  And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down. Instead  as Einstein said  make everything as simple as possible  but no simpler. You can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas. A few things to consider are having examples  stories and analogies. Those are ways to engage and excite us about your content. And when presenting your work  drop the bullet points. Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points   Laughter  What do bullets do  Bullets kill  and they will kill your presentation. A slide like this is not only boring  but it relies too much on the language area of our brain  and causes us to become overwhelmed. Instead  this example slide by Genevieve Brown is much more effective. It's showing that the special structure of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower. And the trick here is to use a single  readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost  and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what's being described. So I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering. And because the engineers that I've worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd  I want to summarize with an equation.  Laughter  Take your science  subtract your bullet points and your jargon  divide by relevance  meaning share what's relevant to the audience  and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you're doing  and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding. And so  scientists and engineers  when you've solved this equation  by all means  talk nerdy to me.  Laughter  Thank you.  Applause  In       I met in Florence a professor  Carlo Pedretti  my former professor of art history  and today a world renowned scholar of Leonardo da Vinci. Well  he asked me if I could find some technological way to unfold a five centuries old mystery related to a lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci  the  Battle of Anghiari   which is supposed to be located in the Hall of the     in Palazzo Vecchio  in Florence. Well  in the mid '  s  there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me  especially in Italy  and so I decided  with some researchers from the United States and the University of Florence  to start probing the murals decorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the     searching for the lost Leonardo. Unfortunately  at that time we did not know that that was not exactly where we should be looking  because we had to go much deeper in  and so the research came to a halt  and it was only taken up in      thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the Guinness family. Well  this time  we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the Hall of the     was before the remodeling  and the so called Sala Grande  which was built in       and to find out the original doors  windows  and in order to do that  we first created a  D model  and then  with thermography  we went on to discover hidden windows. These are the original windows of the hall of the Sala Grande. We also found out about the height of the ceiling  and we managed to reconstruct  therefore  all the layout of this original hall the way it was before there came Vasari  and restructured the whole thing  including a staircase that was very important in order to precisely place  The Battle of Anghiari  on a specific area of one of the two walls. Well  we also learned that Vasari  who was commissioned to remodel the Hall of the     between      and      by the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family  we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap. One that we  see  here  Masaccio  the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence  so we just said  well maybe  Visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo  since he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci. And so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap. And we did find many on the right panel of the east wall  an air gap  and that's where we believe  The Battle of Anghiari   or at least the part that we know has been painted  which is called  The Fight for the Standard   should be located. Well  from there  unfortunately  in       the project came to a halt. Many political reasons. So I decided to go back to my alma mater  and  at the University of California  San Diego  and I proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for cultural heritage. And in       we created CISA  as a research center for cultural heritage  specifically art  architecture and archaeology. So students started to flow in  and we started to build technologies  because that's basically what we also needed in order to move forward and go and do fieldwork. We came back in the Hall of the     in       and this time  with a great group of students  and my colleague  Professor Falko Kuester  who is now the director at CISA   and we came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left. Well  we were confined though  limited  I should rather say  for several reasons that it's not worth explaining  to endoscopy only  of the many other options we had  and with a  mm camera attached to it  we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be a reddish color  black color  and there is some beige fragments that later on we ran a much more sophisticated exams  XRF  X ray diffraction  and the results are very positive so far. It seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments  and since we know for sure that no other artist has painted on that wall before Vasari came in about    years later  well  those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting and most likely to Leonardo. Well  we are searching for the highest and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind. As a matter of fact  this is by far the most important commission that Leonardo has ever had  and for doing this great masterpiece  he was named the number one artist influence at the time. I had also had the privilege since the last    years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me  but basically to do what  Well  to assess  for example  the state of conservation. See here the face of the Madonna of the Chair that when just shining a UV light on it you suddenly see another  different lady  aged lady  I should rather say. There is a lot of varnish still sitting there  several retouches  and some over cleaning. It becomes very visible. But also  technology has helped to write new pages of our history  or at least to update pages of our histories. For example  the  Lady with the Unicorn   another painting by Rafael  well  you see the unicorn. A lot has been said and written about the unicorn  but if you take an X ray of the unicorn  it becomes a puppy dog. And    Laughter    no problem  but  unfortunately  continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn  did not paint the puppy dog  actually left the painting unfinished  so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn    Laughter    unfortunately  is not very reliable.  Laughter  Well  also  authenticity. Just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity of works of art. There would be a cultural revolution to say the least  but also  I would say  a market revolution  let me add. Take this example  Otto Marseus  nice painting  which is  Still Life  at the Pitti Gallery  and just have an infrared camera peering through  and luckily for art historians  it just was confirmed that there is a signature of Otto Marseus. It even says when it was made and also the location. So that was a good result. Sometimes  it's not that good  and so  again  authenticity and science could go together and change the way  not attributions being made  but at least lay the ground for a more objective  or  I should rather say  less subjective attribution  as it is done today. But I would say the discovery that really caught my imagination  my admiration  is the incredibly vivid drawing under this layer  brown layer  of  The Adoration of the Magi.  Here you see a handmade setting XYZ scanner with an infrared camera put on it  and just peering through this brown layer of this masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath. Well  this happens to be the most important painting we have in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci  and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries. Look at these portraits. They're magnificent. You see Leonardo at work. You see the geniality of his creation  right directly on the ground layer of the panel  and see this cool thing  finding  I should rather say  an elephant.  Laughter  Because of this elephant  over    new images came out  never seen for centuries. This was an epiphany. We came to understand and to prove that the brown coating that we see today was not done by Leonardo da Vinci  which left us only the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see  so thanks only to technology. Well  the tablet. Well  we thought  well  if we all have this pleasure  this privilege to see all this  to find all these discoveries  what about for everybody else  So we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet. Let me show you just simulating what we could be doing  any of us could be doing  in a museum environment. So let's say that we go to a museum with a tablet  okay  And we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see  like this. Okay  And I will just click on it  we pause  and now let me turn to you so the moment the image  or  I should say  the camera  has locked in the painting  then the images you just saw up there in the drawing are being loaded. And so  see. We can  as we said  we can zoom in. Then we can scroll. Okay  Let's go and find the elephant. So all we need is one finger. Just wipe off and we see the elephant.  Applause  Okay  And then if we want  we can continue the scroll to find out  for example  on the staircase  the whole iconography is going to be changed. There are a lot of laymen reconstructing from the ruins of an old temple a new temple  and there are a lot of figures showing up. See  This is not just a curiosity  because it changes not just the iconography as you see it  but the iconology  the meaning of the painting  and we believe this is a cool way  easy way  that everybody could have access to  to become more the protagonist of your own discovery  and not just be so passive about it  as we are when we walk through endless rooms of museums. Another concept is the digital clinical chart  which sounds very obvious if we were to talk about real patients  but when we talk about works of art  unfortunately  it's never been tapped as an idea. Well  we believe  again  that this should be the beginning  the very first step  to do real conservation  and allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation  the technique  materials  and also if  when  and why we should restore  or  rather  to intervene on the environment surrounding the painting. Well  our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the Renaissance  create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together. We definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work and rediscover for us these values  these cultural values that we badly need  especially today. And if you want to summarize in one just single word  well  this is what we're trying to do. We're trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future. As long as we live a life of curiosity and passion  there is a bit of Leonardo in all of us. Thank you.  Applause  Over the past six months  I've spent my time traveling. I think I've done        miles  but without leaving my desk. And the reason I can do that is because I'm actually two people. I look like one person but I'm two people. I'm Eddie who is here  and at the same time  my alter ego is a big green boxy avatar nicknamed Cyber Frank. So that's what I spend my time doing. I'd like to start  if it's possible  with a test  because I do business stuff  so it's important that we focus on outcomes. And then I struggled  because I was thinking to myself   What should I talk  What should I do  It's a TED audience. It's got to be stretching. How am I going to make      So I just hope I've got the level of difficulty right. So let's just walk our way through this. Please could you work this through with me  You can shout out the answer if you like. The question is  which of these horizontal lines is longer  The answer is  Audience  The same.Eddie Obeng  The same. No  they're not the same.  Laughter  They're not the same. The top one is    percent longer than the bottom one. So why did you tell me they were the same  Do you remember when we were kids at school  about that big  they played the same trick on us  It was to teach us parallax. Do you remember  And you got  you said   It's the same   And you got it wrong. You remember  And you learned the answer  and you've carried this answer in your head for                years  The answer is the same. The answer is the same. So when you're asked what the lengths are  you say they're the same  but they're not the same  because I've changed it. And this is what I'm trying to explain has happened to us in the   st century. Somebody or something has changed the rules about how our world works. When I'm joking  I try and explain it happened at midnight  you see  while we were asleep  but it was midnight    years ago. Okay  You didn't notice it  But basically  what they do is  they switched all the rules round  so that the way to successfully run a business  an organization  or even a country  has been deleted  flipped  and it's a completely new   you think I'm joking  don't you   there's a completely new set of rules in operation.  Laughter  Did you notice that  I mean  you missed this one. You probably   No  you didn't. Okay.  Laughter  My simple idea is that what's happened is  the real   st century around us isn't so obvious to us  so instead we spend our time responding rationally to a world which we understand and recognize  but which no longer exists. You don't believe me  do you  Okay.  Applause  So let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don't understand. If you search Amazon for the word  creativity   you'll discover something like        books. If you go on Google and you look for  innovation   creativity   you get    million hits. If you add the word  consultants   it doubles to    million.  Laughter  Are you with me  And yet  statistically  what you discover is that about one in         ideas is found making money or delivering benefits two years after its inception. It makes no sense. Companies make their expensive executives spend ages carefully preparing forecasts and budgets which are obsolete or need changing before they can be published. How is that possible  If you look at the visions we have  the visions of how we're going to change the world  the key thing is implementation. We have the vision. We've got to make it happen. We've spent decades professionalizing implementation. People are supposed to be good at making stuff happen. However  if I use as an example a family of five going on holiday  if you can imagine this  all the way from London all the way across to Hong Kong  what I want you to think about is their budget is only       pounds of expenses. What actually happens is  if I compare this to the average real project  average real successful project  the family actually end up in Makassar  South Sulawesi  at a cost of       pounds  whilst leaving two of the children behind.  Laughter  What I'm trying to explain to you is  there are things which don't make sense to us. It gets even worse than that. Let me just walk you through this one. This is a quote  and I'll just pick words out of it. It says    I'll put on the voice     In summary  your Majesty  the failure to foresee the timing  extent and severity of the crisis was due to the lack of creativity and the number of bright minds   or something like that. This was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the Queen of England when she asked the question   Why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming    Laughter  I'll never get my knighthood. I'll never get my knighthood.  Laughter  That's not the important point. The thing you have to remember is  these are eminent economists  some of the smartest people on the planet. Do you see the challenge   Laughter  It's scary. My friend and mentor  Tim Brown of IDEO  he explains that design must get big  and he's right. He wisely explains this to us. He says design thinking must tackle big systems for the challenges we have. He's absolutely right. And then I ask myself   Why was it ever small   Isn't it weird  You know  if collaboration is so cool  is cross functional working is so amazing  why did we build these huge hierarchies  What's going on  You see  I think what's happened  perhaps  is that we've not noticed that change I described earlier. What we do know is that the world has accelerated. Cyberspace moves everything at the speed of light. Technology accelerates things exponentially. So if this is now  and that's the past  and we start thinking about change  you know  all governments are seeking change  you're here seeking change  everybody's after change  it's really cool.  Laughter  So what happens is  we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change. The speed is accelerating. That's not the only thing. At the same time  as we've done that  we've done something really weird. We've doubled the population in    years  put half of them in cities  then connected them all up so they can interact. The density of the interaction of human beings is amazing. There are charts which show all these movements of information. That density of information is amazing. And then we've done a third thing. you know  for those of you who have as an office a little desk underneath the stairs  and you say  well this is my little desk under the stairs  no  You are sitting at the headquarters of a global corporation if you're connected to the Internet. What's happened is  we've changed the scale. Size and scale are no longer the same. And then add to that  every time you tweet  over a third of your followers follow from a country which is not your own. Global is the new scale. We know that. And so people say things like   The world is now a turbulent place.  Have you heard them saying things like that  And they use it as a metaphor. Have you come across this  And they think it's a metaphor  but this is not a metaphor. It's reality. As a young engineering student  I remember going to a demonstration where they basically  the demonstrator did something quite intriguing. What he did was  he got a transparent pipe   have you seen this demonstration before    he attached it to a tap. So effectively what you had was  you had a situation where   I'll try and draw the tap and the pipe  actually I'll skip the tap. The taps are hard. Okay  So I'll write the word  tap.  Is that okay  It's a tap.  Laughter  Okay  so he attaches it to a transparent pipe  and he turns the water on. And he says  do you notice anything  And the water is whooshing down this pipe. I mean  this is not exciting stuff. Are you with me  So the water goes up. He turns it back down. Great. And he says   Anything you notice   No. Then he sticks a needle into the pipe  and he connects this to a container  and he fills the container up with green ink. You with me  So guess what happens  A thin green line comes out as it flows down the pipe. It's not that interesting. And then he turns the water up a bit  so it starts coming back in. And nothing changes. So he's changing the flow of the water  but it's just a boring green line. He adds some more. He adds some more. And then something weird happens. There's this little flicker  and then as he turns it ever so slightly more  the whole of that green line disappears  and instead there are these little sort of inky dust devils close to the needle. They're called eddies. Not me. And they're violently dispersing the ink so that it actually gets diluted out  and the color's gone. What's happened in this world of pipe is somebody has flipped it. They've changed the rules from laminar to turbulent. All the rules are gone. In that environment  instantly  all the possibilities which turbulence brings are available  and it's not the same as laminar. And if we didn't have that green ink  you'd never notice. And I think this is our challenge  because somebody has actually increased   and it's probably you guys with all your tech and stuff   the speed  the scale and the density of interaction. Now how do we cope and deal with that  Well  we could just call it turbulence  or we could try and learn. Yes  learn  but I know you guys grew up in the days when there were actually these things called correct answers  because of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle  and you believe it will last forever. So I'll put a little line up here which represents learning  and that's how we used to do it. We could see things  understand them  take the time to put them into practice. Out here is the world. Now  what's happened to our pace of learning as the world has accelerated  Well  if you work for a corporation  you'll discover it's quite difficult to work on stuff which your boss doesn't approve of  isn't in the strategy  and anyway  you've got to go through your monthly meetings. If you work in an institution  one day you will get them to make that decision. And if you work in a market where people believe in cycles  it's even funnier  because you have to wait all the way for the cycle to fail before you go   There's something wrong.  You with me  So it's likely that the line  in terms of learning  is pretty flat. You with me  This point over here  the point at which the lines cross over  the pace of change overtakes the pace of learning  and for me  that is what I was describing when I was telling you about midnight. So what does it do to us  Well  it completely transforms what we have to do  many mistakes we make. We solve last year's problems without thinking about the future. If you try and think about it  the things you're solving now  what problems are they going to bring in the future  If you haven't understood the world you're living in  it's almost impossible to be absolutely certain that what you're going to deliver fits. I'll give you an example  a quick one. Creativity and ideas  I mentioned that earlier. All the CEOs around me  my clients  they want innovation  so they seek innovation. They say to people   Take risks and be creative   But unfortunately the words get transformed as they travel through the air. Entering their ears  what they hear is   Do crazy things and then I'll fire you.  Why   Laughter  Because   Why  Because in the old world  okay  in the old world  over here  getting stuff wrong was unacceptable. If you got something wrong  you'd failed. How should you be treated  Well  harshly  because you could have asked somebody who had experience. So we learned the answer and we carried this in our heads for        years  are you with me  The answer is  don't do things which are different. And then suddenly we tell them to and it doesn't work. You see  in reality  there are two ways you can fail in our new world. One  you're doing something that you should follow a procedure to  and it's a very difficult thing  you're sloppy  you get it wrong. How should you be treated  You should probably be fired. On the other hand  you're doing something new  no one's ever done before  you get it completely wrong. How should you be treated  Well  free pizzas  You should be treated better than the people who succeed. It's called smart failure. Why  Because you can't put it on your C.V. So what I want to leave you  then  is with the explanation of why I actually traveled        miles from my desk. When I realized the power of this new world  I quit my safe teaching job  and set up a virtual business school  the first in the world  in order to teach people how to make this happen  and I used some of my learnings about some of the rules which I'd learned on myself. If you're interested  worldaftermidnight.com  you'll find out more  but I've applied them to myself for over a decade  and I'm still here  and I still have my house  and the most important thing is  I hope I've done enough to inject a little green ink into your lives  so that when you go away and you're making your next absolutely sensible and rational decision  you'll take some time to think   Hmm  I wonder whether this also makes sense in our new world after midnight.  Thank you very much. Thank you  thank you.  Applause  So I have bad news  I have good news  and I have a task. So the bad news is that we all get sick. I get sick. You get sick. And every one of us gets sick  and the question really is  how sick do we get  Is it something that kills us  Is it something that we survive  Is it something that we can treat  And we've gotten sick as long as we've been people. And so we've always looked for reasons to explain why we get sick. And for a long time  it was the gods  right  The gods are angry with me  or the gods are testing me  right  Or God  singular  more recently  is punishing me or judging me. And as long as we've looked for explanations  we've wound up with something that gets closer and closer to science  which is hypotheses as to why we get sick  and as long as we've had hypotheses about why we get sick  we've tried to treat it as well. So this is Avicenna. He wrote a book over a thousand years ago called  The Canon of Medicine   and the rules he laid out for testing medicines are actually really similar to the rules we have today  that the disease and the medicine must be the same strength  the medicine needs to be pure  and in the end we need to test it in people. And so if you put together these themes of a narrative or a hypothesis in human testing  right  you get some beautiful results  even when we didn't have very good technologies. This is a guy named Carlos Finlay. He had a hypothesis that was way outside the box for his time  in the late     s. He thought yellow fever was not transmitted by dirty clothing. He thought it was transmitted by mosquitos. And they laughed at him. For    years  they called this guy  the mosquito man.  But he ran an experiment in people  right  He had this hypothesis  and he tested it in people. So he got volunteers to go move to Cuba and live in tents and be voluntarily infected with yellow fever. So some of the people in some of the tents had dirty clothes and some of the people were in tents that were full of mosquitos that had been exposed to yellow fever. And it definitively proved that it wasn't this magic dust called fomites in your clothes that caused yellow fever. But it wasn't until we tested it in people that we actually knew. And this is what those people signed up for. This is what it looked like to have yellow fever in Cuba at that time. You suffered in a tent  in the heat  alone  and you probably died. But people volunteered for this. And it's not just a cool example of a scientific design of experiment in theory. They also did this beautiful thing. They signed this document  and it's called an informed consent document. And informed consent is an idea that we should be very proud of as a society  right  It's something that separates us from the Nazis at Nuremberg  enforced medical experimentation. It's the idea that agreement to join a study without understanding isn't agreement. It's something that protects us from harm  from hucksters  from people that would try to hoodwink us into a clinical study that we don't understand  or that we don't agree to. And so you put together the thread of narrative hypothesis  experimentation in humans  and informed consent  and you get what we call clinical study  and it's how we do the vast majority of medical work. It doesn't really matter if you're in the north  the south  the east  the west. Clinical studies form the basis of how we investigate  so if we're going to look at a new drug  right  we test it in people  we draw blood  we do experiments  and we gain consent for that study  to make sure that we're not screwing people over as part of it. But the world is changing around the clinical study  which has been fairly well established for tens of years if not    to     years. So now we're able to gather data about our genomes  but  as we saw earlier  our genomes aren't dispositive. We're able to gather information about our environment. And more importantly  we're able to gather information about our choices  because it turns out that what we think of as our health is more like the interaction of our bodies  our genomes  our choices and our environment. And the clinical methods that we've got aren't very good at studying that because they are based on the idea of person to person interaction. You interact with your doctor and you get enrolled in the study. So this is my grandfather. I actually never met him  but he's holding my mom  and his genes are in me  right  His choices ran through to me. He was a smoker  like most people were. This is my son. So my grandfather's genes go all the way through to him  and my choices are going to affect his health. The technology between these two pictures cannot be more different  but the methodology for clinical studies has not radically changed over that time period. We just have better statistics. The way we gain informed consent was formed in large part after World War II  around the time that picture was taken. That was    years ago  and the way we gain informed consent  this tool that was created to protect us from harm  now creates silos. So the data that we collect for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's trials goes into silos where it can only be used for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's research. Right  It can't be networked. It can't be integrated. It cannot be used by people who aren't credentialed. So a physicist can't get access to it without filing paperwork. A computer scientist can't get access to it without filing paperwork. Computer scientists aren't patient. They don't file paperwork. And this is an accident. These are tools that we created to protect us from harm  but what they're doing is protecting us from innovation now. And that wasn't the goal. It wasn't the point. Right  It's a side effect  if you will  of a power we created to take us for good. And so if you think about it  the depressing thing is that Facebook would never make a change to something as important as an advertising algorithm with a sample size as small as a Phase III clinical trial. We cannot take the information from past trials and put them together to form statistically significant samples. And that sucks  right  So    percent of men develop cancer. Thirty eight percent of women develop cancer. One in four men dies of cancer. One in five women dies of cancer  at least in the United States. And three out of the four drugs we give you if you get cancer fail. And this is personal to me. My sister is a cancer survivor. My mother in law is a cancer survivor. Cancer sucks. And when you have it  you don't have a lot of privacy in the hospital. You're naked the vast majority of the time. People you don't know come in and look at you and poke you and prod you  and when I tell cancer survivors that this tool we created to protect them is actually preventing their data from being used  especially when only three to four percent of people who have cancer ever even sign up for a clinical study  their reaction is not   Thank you  God  for protecting my privacy.  It's outrage that we have this information and we can't use it. And it's an accident. So the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous. Two hundred and twenty six billion a year is spent on cancer in the United States. Fifteen hundred people a day die in the United States. And it's getting worse. So the good news is that some things have changed  and the most important thing that's changed is that we can now measure ourselves in ways that used to be the dominion of the health system. So a lot of people talk about it as digital exhaust. I like to think of it as the dust that runs along behind my kid. We can reach back and grab that dust  and we can learn a lot about health from it  so if our choices are part of our health  what we eat is a really important aspect of our health. So you can do something very simple and basic and take a picture of your food  and if enough people do that  we can learn a lot about how our food affects our health. One interesting thing that came out of this   this is an app for iPhones called The Eatery   is that we think our pizza is significantly healthier than other people's pizza is. Okay   Laughter  And it seems like a trivial result  but this is the sort of research that used to take the health system years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to accomplish. It was done in five months by a startup company of a couple of people. I don't have any financial interest in it. But more nontrivially  we can get our genotypes done  and although our genotypes aren't dispositive  they give us clues. So I could show you mine. It's just A's  T's  C's and G's. This is the interpretation of it. As you can see  I carry a    percent risk of prostate cancer     percent risk of psoriasis and a    percent risk of Alzheimer's disease. So that means  if you're a geneticist  you're freaking out  going   Oh my God  you told everyone you carry the ApoE E  allele. What's wrong with you   Right  When I got these results  I started talking to doctors  and they told me not to tell anyone  and my reaction is   Is that going to help anyone cure me when I get the disease   And no one could tell me yes. And I live in a web world where  when you share things  beautiful stuff happens  not bad stuff. So I started putting this in my slide decks  and I got even more obnoxious  and I went to my doctor  and I said   I'd like to actually get my bloodwork. Please give me back my data.  So this is my most recent bloodwork. As you can see  I have high cholesterol. I have particularly high bad cholesterol  and I have some bad liver numbers  but those are because we had a dinner party with a lot of good wine the night before we ran the test.  Laughter  Right. But look at how non computable this information is. This is like the photograph of my granddad holding my mom from a data perspective  and I had to go into the system and get it out. So the thing that I'm proposing we do here is that we reach behind us and we grab the dust  that we reach into our bodies and we grab the genotype  and we reach into the medical system and we grab our records  and we use it to build something together  which is a commons. And there's been a lot of talk about commonses  right  here  there  everywhere  right. A commons is nothing more than a public good that we build out of private goods. We do it voluntarily  and we do it through standardized legal tools. We do it through standardized technologies. Right. That's all a commons is. It's something that we build together because we think it's important. And a commons of data is something that's really unique  because we make it from our own data. And although a lot of people like privacy as their methodology of control around data  and obsess around privacy  at least some of us really like to share as a form of control  and what's remarkable about digital commonses is you don't need a big percentage if your sample size is big enough to generate something massive and beautiful. So not that many programmers write free software  but we have the Apache web server. Not that many people who read Wikipedia edit  but it works. So as long as some people like to share as their form of control  we can build a commons  as long as we can get the information out. And in biology  the numbers are even better. So Vanderbilt ran a study asking people  we'd like to take your biosamples  your blood  and share them in a biobank  and only five percent of the people opted out. I'm from Tennessee. It's not the most science positive state in the United States of America.  Laughter  But only five percent of the people wanted out. So people like to share  if you give them the opportunity and the choice. And the reason that I got obsessed with this  besides the obvious family aspects  is that I spend a lot of time around mathematicians  and mathematicians are drawn to places where there's a lot of data because they can use it to tease signals out of noise. And those correlations that they can tease out  they're not necessarily causal agents  but math  in this day and age  is like a giant set of power tools that we're leaving on the floor  not plugged in in health  while we use hand saws. If we have a lot of shared genotypes  and a lot of shared outcomes  and a lot of shared lifestyle choices  and a lot of shared environmental information  we can start to tease out the correlations between subtle variations in people  the choices they make and the health that they create as a result of those choices  and there's open source infrastructure to do all of this. Sage Bionetworks is a nonprofit that's built a giant math system that's waiting for data  but there isn't any. So that's what I do. I've actually started what we think is the world's first fully digital  fully self contributed  unlimited in scope  global in participation  ethically approved clinical research study where you contribute the data. So if you reach behind yourself and you grab the dust  if you reach into your body and grab your genome  if you reach into the medical system and somehow extract your medical record  you can actually go through an online informed consent process    because the donation to the commons must be voluntary and it must be informed    and you can actually upload your information and have it syndicated to the mathematicians who will do this sort of big data research  and the goal is to get         in the first year and a million in the first five years so that we have a statistically significant cohort that you can use to take smaller sample sizes from traditional research and map it against  so that you can use it to tease out those subtle correlations between the variations that make us unique and the kinds of health that we need to move forward as a society. And I've spent a lot of time around other commons. I've been around the early web. I've been around the early creative commons world  and there's four things that all of these share  which is  they're all really simple. And so if you were to go to the website and enroll in this study  you're not going to see something complicated. But it's not simplistic. These things are weak intentionally  right  because you can always add power and control to a system  but it's very difficult to remove those things if you put them in at the beginning  and so being simple doesn't mean being simplistic  and being weak doesn't mean weakness. Those are strengths in the system. And open doesn't mean that there's no money. Closed systems  corporations  make a lot of money on the open web  and they're one of the reasons why the open web lives is that corporations have a vested interest in the openness of the system. And so all of these things are part of the clinical study that we've created  so you can actually come in  all you have to be is    years old  willing to sign a contract that says I'm not going to be a jerk  basically  and you're in. You can start analyzing the data. You do have to solve a CAPTCHA as well.  Laughter  And if you'd like to build corporate structures on top of it  that's okay too. That's all in the consent  so if you don't like those terms  you don't come in. It's very much the design principles of a commons that we're trying to bring to health data. And the other thing about these systems is that it only takes a small number of really unreasonable people working together to create them. It didn't take that many people to make Wikipedia Wikipedia  or to keep it Wikipedia. And we're not supposed to be unreasonable in health  and so I hate this word  patient.  I don't like being patient when systems are broken  and health care is broken. I'm not talking about the politics of health care  I'm talking about the way we scientifically approach health care. So I don't want to be patient. And the task I'm giving to you is to not be patient. So I'd like you to actually try  when you go home  to get your data. You'll be shocked and offended and  I would bet  outraged  at how hard it is to get it. But it's a challenge that I hope you'll take  and maybe you'll share it. Maybe you won't. If you don't have anyone in your family who's sick  maybe you wouldn't be unreasonable. But if you do  or if you've been sick  then maybe you would. And we're going to be able to do an experiment in the next several months that lets us know exactly how many unreasonable people are out there. So this is the Athena Breast Health Network. It's a study of         women in California  and they're going to return all the data to the participants of the study in a computable form  with one clickability to load it into the study that I've put together. So we'll know exactly how many people are willing to be unreasonable. So what I'd end  with  is  the most beautiful thing I've learned since I quit my job almost a year ago to do this  is that it really doesn't take very many of us to achieve spectacular results. You just have to be willing to be unreasonable  and the risk we're running is not the risk those    men who got yellow fever ran. Right  It's to be naked  digitally  in public. So you know more about me and my health than I know about you. It's asymmetric now. And being naked and alone can be terrifying. But to be naked in a group  voluntarily  can be quite beautiful. And so it doesn't take all of us. It just takes all of some of us. Thank you. Beau Lotto  So  this game is very simple. All you have to do is read what you see. Right  So  I'm going to count to you  so we don't all do it together. Okay  one  two  three.Audience  Can you read this  BL  Amazing. What about this one  One  two  three.Audience  You are not reading this. BL  All right. One  two  three.  Laughter  If you were Portuguese  right  How about this one  One  two  three. Audience  What are you reading  BL  What are you reading  There are no words there. I said  read what you're seeing. Right  It literally says   Wat ar ou rea in    Laughter  Right  That's what you should have said. Right  Why is this  It's because perception is grounded in our experience. Right  The brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it  which means we never see what's there  we never see information  we only ever see what was useful to see in the past. All right  Which means  when it comes to perception  we're all like this frog. Right  It's getting information. It's generating behavior that's useful.  Laughter  BL  And sometimes  when things don't go our way  we get a little bit annoyed  right  But we're talking about perception here  right  And perception underpins everything we think  we know  we believe  our hopes  our dreams  the clothes we wear  falling in love  everything begins with perception. Now if perception is grounded in our history  it means we're only ever responding according to what we've done before. But actually  it's a tremendous problem  because how can we ever see differently  Now  I want to tell you a story about seeing differently  and all new perceptions begin in the same way. They begin with a question. The problem with questions is they create uncertainty. Now  uncertainty is a very bad thing. It's evolutionarily a bad thing. If you're not sure that's a predator  it's too late. Okay   Laughter  Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty. Right  If you go down below on a boat  your inner ears are you telling you you're moving. Your eyes  because it's moving in register with the boat  say I'm standing still. Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information  and it gets ill. The question  why   is one of the most dangerous things you can do  because it takes you into uncertainty. And yet  the irony is  the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space. So how can we ever do anything new  Well fortunately  evolution has given us an answer  right  And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions. The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty. They're the ones that question the things we think to be true already. Right  It's easy to ask questions about how did life begin  or what extends beyond the universe  but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space. So what is evolution's answer to the problem of uncertainty  It's play. Now play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you that actually it's a way of being. Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated. Uncertainty is what makes play fun. Right  It's adaptable to change. Right  It opens possibility  and it's cooperative. It's actually how we do our social bonding  and it's intrinsically motivated. What that means is that we play to play. Play is its own reward. Now if you look at these five ways of being  these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist. Science is not defined by the method section of a paper. It's actually a way of being  which is here  and this is true for anything that is creative. So if you add rules to play  you have a game. That's actually what an experiment is. So armed with these two ideas  that science is a way of being and experiments are play  we asked  can anyone become a scientist  And who better to ask than    eight  to    year old children  Because they're experts in play. So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon  and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently  but  through the process of science  to see themselves differently. Right  The first step was to ask a question. Now  I should say that we didn't get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn't make a useful contribution to science  and the teachers said kids couldn't do it. So we did it anyway. Right  Of course. So  here are some of the questions. I put them in small print so you wouldn't bother reading it. Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to    years. Right  So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists. Now here  I want to share the stage with someone quite special. Right  She was one of the young people who was involved in this study  and she's now one of the youngest published scientists in the world. Right  She will now  once she comes onto stage  will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED. Right  Now  science and asking questions is about courage. Now she is the personification of courage  because she's going to stand up here and talk to you all. So Amy  would you please come up   Applause  So Amy's going to help me tell the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees Project  and first she's going to tell you the question that they came up with. So go ahead  Amy. Amy O'Toole  Thank you  Beau. We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think  because we look alike. But we wondered if there's a possible link with other animals. It'd be amazing if humans and bees thought similar  since they seem so different from us. So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way. Really  we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions. So what if bees can think like us  Well  it'd be amazing  since we're talking about an insect with only one million brain cells. But it actually makes a lot of sense they should  because bees  like us  can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day  the light  the weather  or from any angle they approach it from.  Applause  BL  So the next step was to design an experiment  which is a game. So the kids went off and they designed this experiment  and so    well  game    and so  Amy  can you tell us what the game was  and the puzzle that you set the bees  AO  The puzzle we came up with was an if then rule. We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color  but to a certain color flower only when it's in a certain pattern. They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue  or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow. Now there's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle. The interesting question is  which  What was really exciting about this project was we  and Beau  had no idea whether it would work. It was completely new  and no one had done it before  including adults.  Laughter  BL  Including the teachers  and that was really hard for the teachers. It's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing  because that's what we do in the lab  but for a teacher not to know what's going to happen at the end of the day    so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick  who was the collaborator on this project. Okay  So I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it  but the next step is observation. So here are some of the students doing the observations. They're recording the data of where the bees fly. Dave Strudwick  Is she still going up here Student  Yeah. Dave Strudwick  So you keep track of each.Student  Henry  can you help me here  BL   Can you help me  Henry   What good scientist says that  right  Student  There's two up there. And three in here. BL  Right  So we've got our observations. We've got our data. They do the simple mathematics  averaging  etc.  etc. And now we want to share. That's the next step. So we're going to write this up and try to submit this for publication. Right  So we have to write it up. So we go  of course  to the pub. All right   Laughter  The one on the left is mine  okay   Laughter  Now  I tell them  a paper has four different sections  an introduction  a methods  a results  a discussion. The introduction says  what's the question and why  Methods  what did you do  Results  what was the observation  And the discussion is  who cares  Right  That's a science paper  basically.  Laughter  So the kids give me the words  right  I put it into a narrative  which means that this paper is written in kidspeak. It's not written by me. It's written by Amy and the other students in the class. As a consequence  this science paper begins   Once upon a time ...    Laughter  The results section  it says   Training phase  the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh.  Right   Laughter  And the methods  it says   Then we put the bees into the fridge  and made bee pie    smiley face. Right   Laughter  This is a science paper. We're going to try to get it published. So here's the title page. We have a number of authors there. All the ones in bold are eight to    years old. The first author is Blackawton Primary School  because if it were ever referenced  it would be  Blackawton et al   and not one individual. So we submit it to a public access journal  and it says this. It said many things  but it said this.  I'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways.   Laughter  In other words  it starts off  once upon a time   the figures are in crayon  etc.  Laughter  So we said  we'll get it reviewed. So I sent it to Dale Purves  who is at the National Academy of Science  one of the leading neuroscientists in the world  and he says   This is the most original science paper I have ever read     Laughter     and it certainly deserves wide exposure.  Larry Maloney  expert in vision  says   The paper is magnificent. The work would be publishable if done by adults.  So what did we do  We send it back to the editor. They say no. So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists  right  putting in the references  and we submit it to Biology Letters. And there  it was reviewed by five independent referees  and it was published. Okay   Applause  It took four months to do the science  two years to get it published.  Laughter  Typical science  actually  right  So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world. What was the feedback like  Well  it was published two days before Christmas  downloaded        times in the first day  right  It was the Editors' Choice in Science  which is a top science magazine. It's forever freely accessible by Biology Letters. It's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal. Last year  it was the second most downloaded paper by Biology Letters  and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well. And I'll just read one.  I have read 'Blackawton Bees' recently. I don't have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now. What you guys have done is real  true and amazing. Curiosity  interest  innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science. Who else can have these qualities more than children  Please congratulate your children's team from my side.  So I'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor. Can I do it on you   Laughter  Oh yeah  yeah  yeah  come on. Yeah yeah. Okay. Now  science is about taking risks  so this is an incredible risk  right   Laughter  For me  not for him. Right  Because we've only done this once before.  Laughter  And you like technology  right  Shimon Schocken  Right  but I like myself. BL  This is the epitome of technology. Right. Okay. Now ...  Laughter  Okay.  Laughter  Now  we're going to do a little demonstration  right  You have to close your eyes  and you have to point where you hear me clapping. All right  Okay  how about if everyone over there shouts. One  two  three  Audience   Shouts  Brilliant. Now  open your eyes. We'll do it one more time. Everyone over there shout.  Shouts  Where's the sound coming from   Laughter   Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  What's the point  The point is what science does for us. Right  We normally walk through life responding  but if we ever want to do anything different  we have to step into uncertainty. When he opened his eyes  he was able to see the world in a new way. That's what science offers us. It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play  right  Now  true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice  so I've asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story. So  Amy  AO  This project was really exciting for me  because it brought the process of discovery to life  and it showed me that anyone  and I mean anyone  has the potential to discover something new  and that a small question can lead into a big discovery. Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard. It all depends on the way the person feels about change. But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy. Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle  I then realized that science isn't just a boring subject  and that anyone can discover something new. You just need an opportunity. My opportunity came in the form of Beau  and the Blackawton Bee Project. Thank you.BL  Thank you very much.  Applause  Once upon a time  the world was a big  dysfunctional family. It was run by the great and powerful parents  and the people were helpless and hopeless naughty children. If any of the more rowdier children questioned the authority of the parents  they were scolded. If they went exploring into the parents' rooms  or even into the secret filing cabinets  they were punished  and told that for their own good they must never go in there again. Then one day  a man came to town with boxes and boxes of secret documents stolen from the parents' rooms.  Look what they've been hiding from you   he said. The children looked and were amazed. There were maps and minutes from meetings where the parents were slagging each other off. They behaved just like the children. And they made mistakes  too  just like the children. The only difference was  their mistakes were in the secret filing cabinets. Well  there was a girl in the town  and she didn't think they should be in the secret filing cabinets  or if they were  there ought to be a law to allow the children access. And so she set about to make it so. Well  I'm the girl in that story  and the secret documents that I was interested in were located in this building  the British Parliament  and the data that I wanted to get my hands on were the expense receipts of members of Parliament. I thought this was a basic question to ask in a democracy.  Applause  It wasn't like I was asking for the code to a nuclear bunker  or anything like that  but the amount of resistance I got from this Freedom of Information request  you would have thought I'd asked something like this. So I fought for about five years doing this  and it was one of many hundreds of requests that I made  not    I didn't    Hey  look  I didn't set out  honestly  to revolutionize the British Parliament. That was not my intention. I was just making these requests as part of research for my first book. But it ended up in this very long  protracted legal battle and there I was after five years fighting against Parliament in front of three of Britain's most eminent High Court judges waiting for their ruling about whether or not Parliament had to release this data. And I've got to tell you  I wasn't that hopeful  because I'd seen the establishment. I thought  it always sticks together. I am out of luck. Well  guess what  I won. Hooray.  Applause  Well  that's not exactly the story  because the problem was that Parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data  and then they tried to retrospectively change the law so that it would no longer apply to them. The transparency law they'd passed earlier that applied to everybody else  they tried to keep it so it didn't apply to them. What they hadn't counted on was digitization  because that meant that all those paper receipts had been scanned in electronically  and it was very easy for somebody to just copy that entire database  put it on a disk  and then just saunter outside of Parliament  which they did  and then they shopped that disk to the highest bidder  which was the Daily Telegraph  and then  you all remember  there was weeks and weeks of revelations  everything from porn movies and bath plugs and new kitchens and mortgages that had never been paid off. The end result was six ministers resigned  the first speaker of the house in     years was forced to resign  a new government was elected on a mandate of transparency      MPs stepped down at that election  and so far  four MPs and two lords have done jail time for fraud. So  thank you.  Applause  Well  I tell you that story because it wasn't unique to Britain. It was an example of a culture clash that's happening all over the world between bewigged and bestockinged officials who think that they can rule over us without very much prying from the public  and then suddenly confronted with a public who is no longer content with that arrangement  and not only not content with it  now  more often  armed with official data itself. So we are moving to this democratization of information  and I've been in this field for quite a while. Slightly embarrassing admission  Even when I was a kid  I used to have these little spy books  and I would  like  see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down. I think that was a pretty good indication about my future career as an investigative journalist  and what I've seen from being in this access to information field for so long is that it used to be quite a niche interest  and it's gone mainstream. Everybody  increasingly  around the world  wants to know about what people in power are doing. They want a say in decisions that are made in their name and with their money. It's this democratization of information that I think is an information enlightenment  and it has many of the same principles of the first Enlightenment. It's about searching for the truth  not because somebody says it's true   because I say so.  No  it's about trying to find the truth based on what you can see and what can be tested. That  in the first Enlightenment  led to questions about the right of kings  the divine right of kings to rule over people  or that women should be subordinate to men  or that the Church was the official word of God. Obviously the Church weren't very happy about this  and they tried to suppress it  but what they hadn't counted on was technology  and then they had the printing press  which suddenly enabled these ideas to spread cheaply  far and fast  and people would come together in coffee houses  discuss the ideas  plot revolution. In our day  we have digitization. That strips all the physical mass out of information  so now it's almost zero cost to copy and share information. Our printing press is the Internet. Our coffee houses are social networks. We're moving to what I would think of as a fully connected system  and we have global decisions to make in this system  decisions about climate  about finance systems  about resources. And think about it    if we want to make an important decision about buying a house  we don't just go off. I mean  I don't know about you  but I want to see a lot of houses before I put that much money into it. And if we're thinking about a finance system  we need a lot of information to take in. It's just not possible for one person to take in the amount  the volume of information  and analyze it to make good decisions. So that's why we're seeing increasingly this demand for access to information. That's why we're starting to see more disclosure laws come out  so for example  on the environment  there's the Aarhus Convention  which is a European directive that gives people a very strong right to know  so if your water company is dumping water into your river  sewage water into your river  you have a right to know about it. In the finance industry  you now have more of a right to know about what's going on  so we have different anti bribery laws  money regulations  increased corporate disclosure  so you can now track assets across borders. And it's getting harder to hide assets  tax avoidance  pay inequality. So that's great. We're starting to find out more and more about these systems. And they're all moving to this central system  this fully connected system  all of them except one. Can you guess which one  It's the system which underpins all these other systems. It's the system by which we organize and exercise power  and there I'm talking about politics  because in politics  we're back to this system  this top down hierarchy. And how is it possible that the volume of information can be processed that needs to in this system  Well  it just can't. That's it. And I think this is largely what's behind the crisis of legitimacy in our different governments right now. So I've told you a bit about what I did to try and drag Parliament  kicking and screaming  into the   st century  and I'm just going to give you a couple of examples of what a few other people I know are doing. So this is a guy called Seb Bacon. He's a computer programmer  and he built a site called Alaveteli  and what it is  it's a Freedom of Information platform. It's open source  with documentation  and it allows you to make a Freedom of Information request  to ask your public body a question  so it takes all the hassle out of it  and I can tell you that there is a lot of hassle making these requests  so it takes all of that hassle out  and you just type in your question  for example  how many police officers have a criminal record  It zooms it off to the appropriate person  it tells you when the time limit is coming to an end  it keeps track of all the correspondence  it posts it up there  and it becomes an archive of public knowledge. So that's open source and it can be used in any country where there is some kind of Freedom of Information law. So there's a list there of the different countries that have it  and then there's a few more coming on board. So if any of you out there like the sound of that and have a law like that in your country  I know that Seb would love to hear from you about collaborating and getting that into your country. This is Birgitta J nsd ttir. She's an Icelandic MP. And quite an unusual MP. In Iceland  she was one of the protesters who was outside of Parliament when the country's economy collapsed  and then she was elected on a reform mandate  and she's now spearheading this project. It's the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative  and they've just got funding to make it an international modern media project  and this is taking all of the best laws around the world about freedom of expression  protection of whistleblowers  protection from libel  source protection  and trying to make Iceland a publishing haven. It's a place where your data can be free  so when we think about  increasingly  how governments want to access user data  what they're trying to do in Iceland is make this safe haven where it can happen. In my own field of investigative journalism  we're also having to start thinking globally  so this is a site called Investigative Dashboard. And if you're trying to track a dictator's assets  for example  Hosni Mubarak  you know  he's just funneling out cash from his country when he knows he's in trouble  and what you want to do to investigate that is  you need to have access to all of the world's  as many as you can  companies' house registrations databases. So this is a website that tries to agglomerate all of those databases into one place so you can start searching for  you know  his relatives  his friends  the head of his security services. You can try and find out how he's moving out assets from that country. But again  when it comes to the decisions which are impacting us the most  perhaps  the most important decisions that are being made about war and so forth  again we can't just make a Freedom of Information request. It's really difficult. So we're still having to rely on illegitimate ways of getting information  through leaks. So when the Guardian did this investigation about the Afghan War  you know  they can't walk into the Department of Defense and ask for all the information. You know  they're just not going to get it. So this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches that were written by American soldiers about the Afghan War  and leaked  and then they're able to do this investigation. Another rather large investigation is around world diplomacy. Again  this is all based around leaks          U.S. diplomatic cables  and I was involved in this investigation because I got this leak through a leak from a disgruntled WikiLeaker and ended up going to work at the Guardian. So I can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access to this leak. It was amazing. I mean  it was amazing. It reminded me of that scene in  The Wizard of Oz.  Do you know the one I mean  Where the little dog Toto runs across to where the wizard  is   and he pulls back  the dog's pulling back the curtain  and     Don't look behind the screen. Don't look at the man behind the screen.  It was just like that  because what you started to see is that all of these grand statesmen  these very pompous politicians  they were just like us. They all bitched about each other. I mean  quite gossipy  those cables. Okay  but I thought it was a very important point for all of us to grasp  these are human beings just like us. They don't have special powers. They're not magic. They are not our parents. Beyond that  what I found most fascinating was the level of endemic corruption that I saw across all different countries  and particularly centered around the heart of power  around public officials who were embezzling the public's money for their own personal enrichment  and allowed to do that because of official secrecy. So I've mentioned WikiLeaks  because surely what could be more open than publishing all the material  Because that is what Julian Assange did. He wasn't content with the way the newspapers published it to be safe and legal. He threw it all out there. That did end up with vulnerable people in Afghanistan being exposed. It also meant that the Belarussian dictator was given a handy list of all the pro democracy campaigners in that country who had spoken to the U.S. government. Is that radical openness  I say it's not  because for me  what it means  it doesn't mean abdicating power  responsibility  accountability  it's actually being a partner with power. It's about sharing responsibility  sharing accountability. Also  the fact that he threatened to sue me because I got a leak of his leaks  I thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency in ideology  to be honest  as well.  Laughs  The other thing is that power is incredibly seductive  and you must have two real qualities  I think  when you come to the table  when you're dealing with power  talking about power  because of its seductive capacity. You've got to have skepticism and humility. Skepticism  because you must always be challenging. I want to see why do you    you just say so  That's not good enough. I want to see the evidence behind why that's so. And humility because we are all human. We all make mistakes. And if you don't have skepticism and humility  then it's a really short journey to go from reformer to autocrat  and I think you only have to read  Animal Farm  to get that message about how power corrupts people. So what is the solution  It is  I believe  to embody within the rule of law rights to information. At the moment our rights are incredibly weak. In a lot of countries  we have Official Secrets Acts  including in Britain here. We have an Official Secrets Act with no public interest test. So that means it's a crime  people are punished  quite severely in a lot of cases  for publishing or giving away official information. Now wouldn't it be amazing  and really  this is what I want all of you to think about  if we had an Official Disclosure Act where officials were punished if they were found to have suppressed or hidden information that was in the public interest  So that    yes. Yes  My power pose.  Applause   Laughs  I would like us to work towards that. So it's not all bad news. I mean  there definitely is progress on the line  but I think what we find is that the closer that we get right into the heart of power  the more opaque  closed it becomes. So it was only just the other week that I heard London's Metropolitan Police Commissioner talking about why the police need access to all of our communications  spying on us without any judicial oversight  and he said it was a matter of life and death. He actually said that  it was a matter of life and death. There was no evidence. He presented no evidence of that. It was just   Because I say so. You have to trust me. Take it on faith.  Well  I'm sorry  people  but we are back to the pre Enlightenment Church  and we need to fight against that. So he was talking about the law in Britain which is the Communications Data Bill  an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation. In America  you have the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act. You've got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance. You have the National Security Agency building the world's giantest spy center. It's just this colossal    it's five times bigger than the U.S. Capitol  in which they're going to intercept and analyze communications  traffic and personal data to try and figure out who's the troublemaker in society. Well  to go back to our original story  the parents have panicked. They've locked all the doors. They've kidded out the house with CCTV cameras. They're watching all of us. They've dug a basement  and they've built a spy center to try and run algorithms and figure out which ones of us are troublesome  and if any of us complain about that  we're arrested for terrorism. Well  is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare  Some fairy tales have happy endings. Some don't. I think we've all read the Grimms' fairy tales  which are  indeed  very grim. But the world isn't a fairy tale  and it could be more brutal than we want to acknowledge. Equally  it could be better than we've been led to believe  but either way  we have to start seeing it exactly as it is  with all of its problems  because it's only by seeing it with all of its problems that we'll be able to fix them and live in a world in which we can all be happily ever after.  Laughs  Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  To understand the world that live in  we tell stories. And while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it  all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online. But video has been left out. It arrived on the web in a small box  and there it has remained  completely disconnected from the data and the content all around it. In fact  in over a decade on the web  the only thing that has changed about video is the size of the box and the quality of the picture. Popcorn changes all of that. It's an online tool that allows anyone to combine video with content pulled live directly from the web. Videos created with Popcorn behave like the web itself  dynamic  full of links  and completely remixable  and finally allowed to break free from the frame. I want to give you a demo of a prototype that we're working on that we'll launch later this fall. It will be completely free  and it will work in any browser. So  every Popcorn production begins with the video  and so I've made a short     second clip using a newscaster template that we use in workshops. So let's watch it. We'll go back  and I'll show you how we made it. Hi  and welcome to my newscast. I've added my location with a Google Map  and it's live  so try moving it around. You can add pop ups with live links and custom icons  or pull in content from any web service  like Flickr  or add articles and blog posts with links out to the full content. So let's go back  and I'll show you what you saw. There was a lot there. So this is the timeline  and if you've ever edited video  you're familiar with this  but instead of clips in the timeline  what you're looking at is web events pulled into the video. Now in this Popcorn production we've got the title card  we've got a Google Map that shows up picture in picture  then Popcorn lets it push outside the frame and take over the whole screen. There are two pop ups bringing you some other information  and a final article with a link out to the original article. Let's go to this Google Map  and I'll show you how you can edit it. All you do  go into the timeline  double click the item  and I've set it to Toronto  because that's where I'm from. Let's set it to something else. Popcorn immediately goes out onto the web  talks to Google  grabs the map  and puts it in the display. And it's exactly the same for the people who watch your production. And it's live. It's not an image. So you click on it  you zoom in  right down to street view if you want to. Now in the video  I mentioned adding a live feed  which we can do right now  so let's add a live feed from Flickr. Go over to the right hand side  grab Flickr from the list of options  drag it into the timeline  and put it where you'd like it to go  and it immediately goes out to Flickr and starts pulling in images based on the tags. Now  my developers really like ponies  and so they've set that as the default tag. Let's try something else  maybe something a bit more relevant to today. Now here are live images being pulled straight from the feed. If you come and watch this a week from now  this will be completely different  dynamic  just like the web  and just like the web  everything is sourced  so click your link  and you go straight to Flickr and see the source image. Everything you've seen today is built with the basic building blocks of the web  HTML  CSS and JavaScript. That means it's completely remixable. It also means there's no proprietary software. All you need is a web browser. So imagine if every video that we watched on the web worked like the web  completely remixable  linked to its source content  and interactive for everyone who views it. I think Popcorn could change the way that we tell stories on the web  and the way we understand the world we live in. Thank you.  Applause  I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are  how globalized we aren't  and why it's important to actually be accurate in making those kinds of assessments. And the leading point of view on this  whether measured by number of books sold  mentions in media  or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization  is this view that national borders really don't matter very much anymore  cross border integration is close to complete  and we live in one world. And what's interesting about this view is  again  it's a view that's held by pro globalizers like Tom Friedman  from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted  but it's also held by anti globalizers  who see this giant globalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives if it hasn't already done so. The other thing I would add is that this is not a new view. I'm a little bit of an amateur historian  so I've spent some time going back  trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing. And the best  earliest quote that I could find was one from David Livingstone  writing in the     s about how the railroad  the steam ship  and the telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly with the rest of the world. Now clearly  David Livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time  but it does seem useful to ask ourselves   Just how global are we   before we think about where we go from here. So the best way I've found of trying to get people to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat  may not even be close to flat  is with some data. So one of the things I've been doing over the last few years is really compiling data on things that could either happen within national borders or across national borders  and I've looked at the cross border component as a percentage of the total. I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today  but let me just give you a few data points. I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow  one kind of flow of people  one kind of flow of capital  and  of course  trade in products and services. So let's start off with plain old telephone service. Of all the voice calling minutes in the world last year  what percentage do you think were accounted for by cross border phone calls  Pick a percentage in your own mind. The answer turns out to be two percent. If you include Internet telephony  you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent  but it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate. Or let's turn to people moving across borders. One particular thing we might look at  in terms of long term flows of people  is what percentage of the world's population is accounted for by first generation immigrants  Again  please pick a percentage. Turns out to be a little bit higher. It's actually about three percent. Or think of investment. Take all the real investment that went on in the world in     . What percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment  Not quite ten percent. And then finally  the one statistic that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen  the export to GDP ratio. If you look at the official statistics  they typically indicate a little bit above    percent. However  there's a big problem with the official statistics  in that if  for instance  a Japanese component supplier ships something to China to be put into an iPod  and then the iPod gets shipped to the U.S.  that component ends up getting counted multiple times. So nobody knows how bad this bias with the official statistics actually is  so I thought I would ask the person who's spearheading the effort to generate data on this  Pascal Lamy  the Director of the World Trade Organization  what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of GDP  without the double  and triple counting  and it's actually probably a bit under    percent  rather than the    percent plus numbers that we're talking about. So it's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that I talk about in my book   World  .    that we're very  very far from the no border effect benchmark  which would imply internationalization levels of the order of            percent. So clearly  apocalyptically minded authors have overstated the case. But it's not just the apocalyptics  as I think of them  who are prone to this kind of overstatement. I've also spent some time surveying audiences in different parts of the world on what they actually guess these numbers to be. Let me share with you the results of a survey that Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run of its readership as to what people's guesses along these dimensions actually were. So a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide. First of all  there is a suggestion of some error. Okay.  Laughter  Second  these are pretty large errors. For four quantities whose average value is less than    percent  you have people guessing three  four times that level. Even though I'm an economist  I find that a pretty large error. And third  this is not just confined to the readers of the Harvard Business Review. I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world  and in all cases except one  where a group actually underestimated the trade to GDP ratio  people have this tendency towards overestimation  and so I thought it important to give a name to this  and that's what I refer to as globaloney  the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars. Especially because  I suspect  some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims  I think it's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to globaloney. A couple of different reasons come to mind. First of all  there's a real dearth of data in the debate. Let me give you an example. When I first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called Foreign Policy  one of the people who wrote in  not entirely in agreement  was Tom Friedman. And since my article was titled  Why the World Isn't Flat   that wasn't too surprising.  Laughter  What was very surprising to me was Tom's critique  which was   Ghemawat's data are narrow.  And this caused me to scratch my head  because as I went back through his several hundred page book  I couldn't find a single figure  chart  table  reference or footnote. So my point is  I haven't presented a lot of data here to convince you that I'm right  but I would urge you to go away and look for your own data to try and actually assess whether some of these hand me down insights that we've been bombarded with actually are correct. So dearth of data in the debate is one reason. A second reason has to do with peer pressure. I remember  I decided to write my  Why the World Isn't Flat  article  because I was being interviewed on TV in Mumbai  and the interviewer's first question to me was   Professor Ghemawat  why do you still believe that the world is round   And I started laughing  because I hadn't come across that formulation before.  Laughter  And as I was laughing  I was thinking  I really need a more coherent response  especially on national TV. I'd better write something about this.  Laughter  But what I can't quite capture for you was the pity and disbelief with which the interviewer asked her question. The perspective was  here is this poor professor. He's clearly been in a cave for the last        years. He really has no idea as to what's actually going on in the world. So try this out with your friends and acquaintances  if you like. You'll find that it's very cool to talk about the world being one  etc. If you raise questions about that formulation  you really are considered a bit of an antique. And then the final reason  which I mention  especially to a TED audience  with some trepidation  has to do with what I call  techno trances.  If you listen to techno music for long periods of time  it does things to your brainwave activity.  Laughter  Something similar seems to happen with exaggerated conceptions of how technology is going to overpower in the very immediate run all cultural barriers  all political barriers  all geographic barriers  because at this point I know you aren't allowed to ask me questions  but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students  hands go up  and people ask me   Yeah  but what about Facebook   And I got this question often enough that I thought I'd better do some research on Facebook. Because  in some sense  it's the ideal kind of technology to think about. Theoretically  it makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door. What percentage of people's friends on Facebook are actually located in countries other than where people we're analyzing are based  The answer is probably somewhere between    to    percent. Non negligible  so we don't live in an entirely local or national world  but very  very far from the    percent level that you would expect  and the reason's very simple. We don't  or I hope we don't  form friendships at random on Facebook. The technology is overlaid on a pre existing matrix of relationships that we have  and those relationships are what the technology doesn't quite displace. Those relationships are why we get far fewer than    percent of our friends being located in countries other than where we are. So does all this matter  Or is globaloney just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization related issues  I want to suggest that actually  globaloney can be very harmful to your health. First of all  recognizing that the glass is only    to    percent full is critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional gains from additional integration  whereas if we thought we were already there  there would be no particular point to pushing harder. It's a little bit like  we wouldn't be having a conference on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about at this conference. So being accurate about how limited globalization levels are is critical to even being able to notice that there might be room for something more  something that would contribute further to global welfare. Which brings me to my second point. Avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization. So I actually spend most of my  World  .   book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate. I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today  so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what I have in mind. Think of France and the current debate about immigration. When you ask people in France what percentage of the French population is immigrants  the answer is about    percent. That's their guess. Maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue. Or to take an even more striking example  when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations did a survey of Americans  asking them to guess what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid  the guess was    percent  which is slightly in excess of the actual level     actually about ...       Laughter    of U.S. governmental commitments to federal aid. The reassuring thing about this particular survey was  when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data  some of them   not all of them   seemed to become more willing to consider increases in foreign aid. So foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up here  because if you think about it  what I've been talking about today is this notion    very uncontroversial amongst economists    that most things are very home biased.  Foreign aid is the most aid to poor people   is about the most home biased thing you can find. If you look at the OECD countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person  and compare it with how much they spend per poor person in poor countries  the ratio   Branko Milanovic at the World Bank did the calculations   turns out to be about        to one. Now of course  some of us  if we truly are cosmopolitan  would like to see that ratio being brought down to one is to one. I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are. If we simply brought that ratio down to        to one  we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the Rio Summit    years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on. So in summary  while radical openness is great  given how closed we are  even incremental openness could make things dramatically better. Thank you very much.  Applause  In the   th century  a woman named Giulia Tofana had a very successful perfume business. For over    years she ran it. It sort of ended abruptly when she was executed    Laughter    for murdering     men. You see  it wasn't a very good perfume. In fact  it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless  but as a poison  it was the best money could buy  so women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands. It turns out that poisoners were a valued and feared group  because poisoning a human being is a quite difficult thing. The reason is  we have sort of a built in poison detector. You can see this as early as even in newborn infants. If you are willing to do this  you can take a couple of drops of a bitter substance or a sour substance  and you'll see that face  the tongue stick out  the wrinkled nose  as if they're trying to get rid of what's in their mouth. This reaction expands into adulthood and becomes sort of a full blown disgust response  no longer just about whether or not we're about to be poisoned  but whenever there's a threat of physical contamination from some source. But the face remains strikingly similar. It has expanded more  though  than just keeping us away from physical contaminants  and there's a growing body of evidence to suggest that  in fact  this emotion of disgust now influences our moral beliefs and even our deeply held political intuitions. Why this might be the case  We can understand this process by understanding a little bit about emotions in general. So the basic human emotions  those kinds of emotions that we share with all other human beings  exist because they motivate us to do good things and they keep us away from doing bad things. So by and large  they are good for our survival. Take the emotion of fear  for instance. It keeps us away from doing things that are really  really risky. This photo taken just before his death    Laughter    is actually a   No  one reason this photo is interesting is because most people would not do this  and if they did  they would not live to tell it  because fear would have kicked in a long time ago to a natural predator. Just like fear offers us protective benefits  disgust seems to do the same thing  except for what disgust does is keeps us away from not things that might eat us  or heights  but rather things that might poison us  or give us disease and make us sick. So one of the features of disgust that makes it such an interesting emotion is that it's very  very easy to elicit  in fact more so than probably any of the other basic emotions  and so I'm going to show you that with a couple of images I can probably make you feel disgust. So turn away. I'll tell you when you can turn back. I mean  you see it every day  right  I mean  come on.  Laughter  Okay  turn back  if you didn't look. Those probably made a lot of you in the audience feel very  very disgusted  but if you didn't look  I can tell you about some of the other things that have been shown sort of across the world to make people disgusted  things like feces  urine  blood  rotten flesh. These are the sorts of things that it makes sense for us to stay away from  because they might actually contaminate us. In fact  just having a diseased appearance or odd sexual acts  these things are also things that give us a lot of disgust. Darwin was probably one of the first scientists to systematically investigate the human emotions  and he pointed to the universal nature and the strength of the disgust response. This is an anecdote from his travels in South America.  In Tierro del Fuego a native touched with his finger some cold preserved meat while I was eating ... and plainly showed disgust at its softness  whilst I felt utter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage    Laughter    though his hands did not appear dirty.  He later wrote   It's okay  some of my best friends are naked savages.   Laughter  Well it turns out it's not only old timey British scientists who are this squeamish. I recently got a chance to talk to Richard Dawkins for a documentary  and I was able to disgust him a bunch of times. Here's my favorite. Richard Dawkins   We've evolved around courtship and sex  are attached to deep rooted emotions and reactions that are hard to jettison overnight.  David Pizarro  So my favorite part of this clip is that Professor Dawkins actually gagged. He jumps back  and he gags  and we had to do it three times  and all three times he gagged.  Laughter  And he was really gagging. I thought he might throw up on me  actually. One of the features  though  of disgust  is not just its universality and its strength  but the way that it works through association. So when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing  that clean thing becomes disgusting  not the other way around. This makes it very useful as a strategy if you want to convince somebody that an object or an individual or an entire social group is disgusting and should be avoided. The philosopher Martha Nussbaum points this out in this quote   Thus throughout history  certain disgust properties    sliminess  bad smell  stickiness  decay  foulness    have been repeatedly and monotonously been associated with ... Jews  women  homosexuals  untouchables  lower class people    all of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body.  Let me give you just some examples of how  some powerful examples of how this has been used historically. This comes from a Nazi children's book published in        Just look at these guys  The louse infested beards  the filthy  protruding ears  those stained  fatty clothes... Jews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor. If you have a good nose  you can smell the Jews.  A more modern example comes from people who try to convince us that homosexuality is immoral. This is from an anti gay website  where they said gays are  worthy of death for their vile ... sex practices.  They're like  dogs eating their own vomit and sows wallowing in their own feces.  These are disgust properties that are trying to be directly linked to the social group that you should not like. When we were first investigating the role of disgust in moral judgment  one of the things we became interested in was whether or not these sorts of appeals are more likely to work in individuals who are more easily disgusted. So while disgust  along with the other basic emotions  are universal phenomena  it just really is true that some people are easier to disgust than others. You could probably see it in the audience members when I showed you those disgusting images. The way that we measured this was by a scale that was constructed by some other psychologists that simply asked people across a wide variety of situations how likely they are to feel disgust. So here are a couple of examples.  Even if I were hungry  I would not drink a bowl of my favorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed fly swatter.   Do you agree or disagree    Laughter   While you are walking through a tunnel under a railroad track  you smell urine. Would you be very disgusted or not at all disgusted   If you ask enough of these  you can get a general overall score of disgust sensitivity. It turns out that this score is actually meaningful. When you bring people into the laboratory and you ask them if they're willing to engage in safe but disgusting behaviors like eating chocolate that's been baked to look like dog poop  or in this case eating some mealworms that are perfectly healthy but pretty gross  your score on that scale actually predicts whether or not you'll be willing to engage in those behaviors. The first time that we set out to collect data on this and associate it with political or moral beliefs  we found a general pattern    this is with the psychologists Yoel Inbar and Paul Bloom    that in fact  across three studies we kept finding that people who reported that they were easily disgusted also reported that they were more politically conservative. Another way to say this  though  is that people who are very liberal are very hard to disgust.  Laughter  In a more recent follow up study  we were able to look at a much greater sample  a much larger sample. In this case  this is nearly        U.S. respondents  and we find the same pattern. As you can see  people who are on the very conservative side of answering the political orientation scale are also much more likely to report that they're easily disgusted. This data set also allowed us to statistically control for a number of things that we knew were both related to political orientation and to disgust sensitivity. So we were able to control for gender  age  income  education  even basic personality variables  and the result stays the same. When we actually looked at not just self reported political orientation  but voting behavior  we were able to look geographically across the nation. What we found was that in regions in which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity  McCain got more votes. So it not only predicted self reported political orientation  but actual voting behavior. And also we were able  with this sample  to look across the world  in     different countries we asked the same questions  and as you can see  this is     countries collapsed into    different geographical regions. No matter where you look  what this is plotting is the size of the relationship between disgust sensitivity and political orientation  and no matter where we looked  we saw a very similar effect. Other labs have actually looked at this as well using different measures of disgust sensitivity  so rather than asking people how easily disgusted they are  they hook people up to physiological measures  in this case skin conductance. And what they've demonstrated is that people who report being more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused when you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you. Interestingly  what they also showed in a finding that we kept getting in our previous studies as well was that one of the strongest influences here is that individuals who are very disgust sensitive not only are more likely to report being politically conservative  but they're also very much more opposed to gay marriage and homosexuality and pretty much a lot of the socio moral issues in the sexual domain. So physiological arousal predicted  in this study  attitudes toward gay marriage. But even with all these data linking disgust sensitivity and political orientation  one of the questions that remains is what is the causal link here  Is it the case that disgust really is shaping political and moral beliefs  We have to resort to experimental methods to answer this  and so what we can do is actually bring people into the lab and disgust them and compare them to a control group that hasn't been disgusted. It turns out that over the past five years a number of researchers have done this  and by and large the results have all been the same  that when people are feeling disgust  their attitudes shift towards the right of the political spectrum  toward more moral conservatism as well. So this is whether you use a foul odor  a bad taste  from film clips  from post hypnotic suggestions of disgust  images like the ones I've shown you  even just reminding people that disease is prevalent and they should be wary of it and wash up  right  to keep clean  these all have similar effects on judgment. Let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted. We asked participants to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups  and we either made the room smell gross or not. When the room smelled gross  what we saw was that individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men. Disgust didn't influence attitudes toward all the other social groups that we asked  including African Americans  the elderly. It really came down to the attitudes they had toward gay men. In another set of studies we actually simply reminded people    this was at a time when the swine flu was going around    we reminded people that in order to prevent the spread of the flu that they ought to wash their hands. For some participants  we actually had them take questionnaires next to a sign that reminded them to wash their hands. And what we found was that just taking a questionnaire next to this hand sanitizing reminder made individuals report being more politically conservative. And when we asked them a variety of questions about the rightness or wrongness of certain acts  what we also found was that simply being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them more morally conservative. In particular  when we asked them questions about sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices  just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them think that they were more morally wrong. Let me give you an example of what I mean by harmless but taboo sexual practice. We gave them scenarios. One of them said a man is house sitting for his grandmother. When his grandmother's away  he has sex with his girlfriend on his grandma's bed. In another one  we said a woman enjoys masturbating with her favorite teddy bear cuddled next to her.  Laughter  People find these to be more morally abhorrent if they've been reminded to wash their hands.  Laughter  Okay. The fact that emotions influence our judgment should come as no surprise. I mean  that's part of how emotions work. They not only motivate you to behave in certain ways  but they change the way you think. In the case of disgust  what is a little bit more surprising is the scope of this influence. It makes perfect sense  and it's a very good emotion for us to have  that disgust would make me change the way that I perceive the physical world whenever contamination is possible. It makes less sense that an emotion that was built to prevent me from ingesting poison should predict who I'm going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election. The question of whether disgust ought to influence our moral and political judgments certainly has to be complex  and might depend on exactly what judgments we're talking about  and as a scientist  we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method is just ill equipped to answer these sorts of questions. But one thing that I am fairly certain about is  at the very least  what we can do with this research is point to what questions we ought to ask in the first place. Thank you.  Applause  Having spent    years as a child of the state in children's homes and foster care  you could say that I'm an expert on the subject  and in being an expert  I want to let you know that being an expert does in no way make you right in light of the truth. If you're in care  legally the government is your parent  loco parentis. Margaret Thatcher was my mother.  Laughter  Let's not talk about breastfeeding.  Laughter  Harry Potter was a foster child. Pip from  Great Expectations  was adopted  Superman was a foster child  Cinderella was a foster child  Lisbeth Salander  the girl with the dragon tattoo  was fostered and institutionalized  Batman was orphaned  Lyra Belacqua from Philip Pullman's  Northern Lights  was fostered  Jane Eyre  adopted  Roald Dahl's James from  James and the Giant Peach   Matilda  Moses    Moses   Laughter  Moses   Laughter     the boys in Michael Morpurgo's  Friend or Foe   Alem in Benjamin Zephaniah's  Refugee Boy   Luke Skywalker    Luke Skywalker   Laughter     Oliver Twist  Cassia in  The Concubine of Shanghai  by Hong Ying  Celie in Alice Walker's  The Color Purple.  All of these great fictional characters  all of them who were hurt by their condition  all of them who spawned thousands of other books and other films  all of them were fostered  adopted or orphaned. It seems that writers know that the child outside of family reflects on what family truly is more than what it promotes itself to be. That is  they also use extraordinary skills to deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis. How have we not made the connection  And why have we not made the connection  between   How has that happened    between these incredible characters of popular culture and religions  and the fostered  adopted or orphaned child in our midst  It's not our pity that they need. It's our respect. I know famous musicians  I know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists and top lawyers and television executives and magazine editors and national journalists and dustbinmen and hairdressers  all who were looked after children  fostered  adopted or orphaned  and many of them grow into their adult lives in fear of speaking of their background  as if it may somehow weaken their standing in the foreground  as if it were somehow Kryptonite  as if it were a time bomb strapped on the inside. Children in care  who've had a life in care  deserve the right to own and live the memory of their own childhood. It is that simple. My own mother   and I should say this here   she same to this country in the late '  s  and she was  you know  she found herself pregnant  as women did in the late '  s. You know what I mean  They found themselves pregnant. And she sort of  she had no idea of the context in which she'd landed. In the     s    I should give you some context    in the     s  if you were pregnant and you were single  you were seen as a threat to the community. You were separated from your family by the state. You were separated from your family and placed into mother and baby homes. You were appointed a social worker. The adoptive parents were lined up. It was the primary purpose of the social worker  the aim  to get the woman at her most vulnerable time in her entire life  to sign the adoption papers. So the adoption papers were signed. The mother and baby's homes were often run by nuns. The adoption papers were signed  the child was given to the adoptive parents  and the mother shipped back to her community to say that she'd been on a little break. A little break. A little break. The first secret of shame for a woman for being a woman   a little break.  The adoption process took  like  a matter of months  so it was a closed shop  you know  sealed deal  an industrious  utilitarian solution  the government  the farmer  the adopting parents  the consumer  the mother  the earth  and the child  the crop. It's kind of easy to patronize the past  to forego our responsibilities in the present. What happened then is a direct reflection of what is happening now. Everybody believed themselves to be doing the right thing by God and by the state for the big society  fast tracking adoption. So anyway  she comes here        she's pregnant  and she comes from Ethiopia that was celebrating its own jubilee at the time under the Emperor Haile Selassie  and she lands months before the Enoch Powell speech  the  Rivers of Blood  speech. She lands months before the Beatles release  The White Album   months before Martin Luther King was killed. It was a summer of love if you were white. If you were black  it was a summer of hate. So she goes from Oxford  she's sent to the north of England to a mother and baby home  and appointed a social worker. It's her plan. You know  I have to say this in the Houses    It's her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time while she studies. But the social worker  he had a different agenda. He found the foster parents  and he said to them   Treat this as an adoption. He's yours forever. His name is Norman.   Laughter  Norman   Laughter  Norman  So they took me. I was a message  they said. I was a sign from God  they said. I was Norman Mark Greenwood. Now  for the next    years  all I know is that this woman  this birth woman  should have her eyes scratched out for not signing the adoption papers. She was an evil woman too selfish to sign  so I spent those    years kneeling and praying. I tried praying. I swear I tried praying.  God  can I have a bike for Christmas   But I would always answer myself   Yes  of course you can.  And then I was supposed to determine whether that was the voice of God or it was the voice of the Devil. And it turns out I've got the Devil inside of me. Who knew   Laughter  So anyway  two years sort of passed  and they had a child of their own  and then another two years passed  and they had another child of their own  and then another time passed and they had another child that they called an accident  which I thought was an unusual name.  Laughter  And I was on the cusp of  sort of  adolescence  so I was starting to take biscuits from the tin without asking. I was starting to stay out a little bit late  etc.  etc. Now  in their religiosity  in their naivete  my mom and dad  which I believed them to be forever  as they said they were  my mom and dad conceived that I had the Devil inside of me. And what    I should say this here  because this is how they engineered my leaving. They sat me at a table  my foster mom  and she said to me   You don't love us  do you   At    years old. They've had three other children. I'm the fourth. The third was an accident. And I said   Yeah  of course I do.  Because you do. My foster mother asked me to go away to think about love and what it is and to read the Scriptures and to come back tomorrow and give my most honest and truthful answer. So this was an opportunity. If they were asking me whether I loved them or not  then I mustn't love them  which led me to the miracle of thought that I thought they wanted me to get to.  I will ask God for forgiveness and His light will shine through me to them. How fantastic.  This was an opportunity. The theology was perfect  the timing unquestionable  and the answer as honest as a sinner could get.  I mustn't love you   I said to them.  But I will ask God for forgiveness.   Because you don't love us  Norman  clearly you've chosen your path.  Twenty four hours later  my social worker  this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months  he's waiting for me in the car as I say goodbye to my parents. I didn't say goodbye to anybody  not my mother  my father  my sisters  my brothers  my aunts  my uncles  my cousins  my grandparents  nobody. On the way to the children's home  I started to ask myself   What's happened to me   It's not that I'd had the rug pulled from beneath me as much as the entire floor had been taken away. When I got to the   For the next four  five years  I was held in four different children's homes. On the third children's home  at     I started to rebel  and what I did was  I got three tins of paint  Airfix paint that you use for models  and I was    it was a big children's home  big Victorian children's home    and I was in a little turret at the top of it  and I poured them  red  yellow and green  the colors of Africa  down the tiles. You couldn't see it from the street  because the home was surrounded by beech trees. For doing this  I was incarcerated for a year in an assessment center which was actually a remand center. It was a virtual prison for young people. By the way  years later  my social worker said that I should never have been put in there. I wasn't charged for anything. I hadn't done anything wrong. But because I had no family to inquire about me  they could do anything to me. I'm    years old  and they had a padded cell. They would march me down corridors in last size order. They    I was put in a dormitory with a confirmed Nazi sympathizer. All of the staff were ex police    interesting    and ex probation officers. The man who ran it was an ex army officer. Every time I had a visit by a person who I did not know who would feed me grapes  once every three months  I was strip searched. That home was full of young boys who were on remand for things like murder. And this was the preparation that I was being given after    years as a child of the state. I have to tell this story. I have to tell it  because there was no one to put two and two together. I slowly became aware that I knew nobody that knew me for longer than a year. See  that's what family does. It gives you reference points. I'm not defining a good family from a bad family. I'm just saying that you know when your birthday is by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is  a mother  a father  a sister  a brother  an aunt  an uncle  a cousin  a grandparent. It matters to someone  and therefore it matters to you. Understand  I was    years old  tucked away in myself  into myself  and I wasn't touched either  physically touched. I'm reporting back. I'm reporting back simply to say that when I left the children's home I had two things that I wanted to do. One was to find my family  and the other was to write poetry. In creativity I saw light. In the imagination I saw the endless possibility of life  the endless truth  the permanent creation of reality  the place where anger was an expression in the search for love  a place where dysfunction is a true reaction to untruth. I've just got to say it to you all  I found all of my family in my adult life. I spent all of my adult life finding them  and I've now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else. But I'm reporting back to you to say quite simply that you can define how strong a democracy is by how its government treats its child. I don't mean children. I mean the child of the state. Thanks very much. It's been an honor.  Applause  I was one of those kids that  every time I got in the car  I basically had to roll down the window. It was usually too hot  too stuffy or just too smelly  and my father would not let us use the air conditioner. He said that it would overheat the engine. And you might remember  some of you  how the cars were back then  and it was a common problem of overheating. But it was also the signal that capped the use  or overuse  of energy consuming devices. Things have changed now. We have cars that we take across country. We blast the air conditioning the entire way  and we never experience overheating. So there's no more signal for us to tell us to stop. Great  right  Well  we have similar problems in buildings. In the past  before air conditioning  we had thick walls. The thick walls are great for insulation. It keeps the interior very cool during the summertime  and warm during the wintertime  and the small windows were also very good because it limited the amount of temperature transfer between the interior and exterior. Then in about the     s  with the advent of plate glass  rolled steel and mass production  we were able to make floor to ceiling windows and unobstructed views  and with that came the irreversible reliance on mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar heated spaces. Over time  the buildings got taller and bigger  our engineering even better  so that the mechanical systems were massive. They require a huge amount of energy. They give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere  and for some of you may understand the heat island effect in cities  where the urban areas are much more warm than the adjacent rural areas  but we also have problems that  when we lose power  we can't open a window here  and so the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant until that air conditioning system can start up again. Even worse  with our intention of trying to make buildings move towards a net zero energy state  we can't do it just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient. We need to look for something else  and we've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut. So what do we do here  How do we pull ourselves and dig us out of this hole that we've dug  If we look at biology  and many of you probably don't know  I was a biology major before I went into architecture  the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates the temperature in the body  and it's a fantastic thing. That's the first line of defense for the body. It has pores  it has sweat glands  it has all these things that work together very dynamically and very efficiently  and so what I propose is that our building skins should be more similar to human skin  and by doing so can be much more dynamic  responsive and differentiated  depending on where it is. And this gets me back to my research. What I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that. I presently  or currently  work with smart materials  and a smart thermo bimetal. First of all  I guess we call it smart because it requires no controls and it requires no energy  and that's a very big deal for architecture. What it is  it's a lamination of two different metals together. You can see that here by the different reflection on this side. And because it has two different coefficients of expansion  when heated  one side will expand faster than the other and result in a curling action. So in early prototypes I built these surfaces to try to see how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow air to ventilate through the system  and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity of having these strips together can try to make bigger movement happen when also heated  and currently have this installation at the Materials   Applications gallery in Silver Lake  close by  and it's there until August  if you want to see it. It's called  Bloom   and the surface is made completely out of thermo bimetal  and its intention is to make this canopy that does two things. One  it's a sun shading device  so that when the sun hits the surface  it constricts the amount of sun passing through  and in other areas  it's a ventilating system  so that hot  trapped air underneath can actually move through and out when necessary. You can see here in this time lapse video that the sun  as it moves across the surface  as well as the shade  each of the tiles moves individually. Keep in mind  with the digital technology that we have today  this thing was made out of about        pieces and there's no two pieces alike at all. Every single one is different. And the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate each one to be very  very specific to its location  to the angle of the sun  and also how the thing actually curls. So this kind of proof of concept project has a lot of implications to actual future application in architecture  and in this case  here you see a house  that's for a developer in China  and it's actually a four story glass box. It's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access  but now it's sheathed with this thermo bimetal layer  it's a screen that goes around it  and that layer can actually open and close as that sun moves around on that surface. In addition to that  it can also screen areas for privacy  so that it can differentiate from some of the public areas in the space during different times of day. And what it basically implies is that  in houses now  we don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things  as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building. I'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market  and so here you see a pretty typical double glazed window panel  and in that panel  between those two pieces of glass  that double glazing  I'm trying to work on making a thermo bimetal pattern system so that when the sun hits that outside layer and heats that interior cavity  that thermo bimetal will begin to curl  and what actually will happen then is it'll start to block out the sun in certain areas of the building  and totally  if necessary. And so you can imagine  even in this application  that in a high rise building where the panel systems go from floor to floor up to        floors  the entire surface could be differentiated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface. And these are some later studies that I'm working on right now that are on the boards  where you can see  in the bottom right hand corner  with the red  it's actually smaller pieces of thermometal  and it's actually going to  we're trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes. This last project is also of components. The influence    and if you have noticed  one of my spheres of influence is biology    is from a grasshopper. And grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system. They breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles  and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down  and so in this project  I'm trying to look at how we can consider that in architecture too  how we can bring air through holes in the sides of a building. And so you see here some early studies of blocks  where those holes are actually coming through  and this is before the thermo bimetal is applied  and this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry  it's a little hard to see  but on the surfaces  you can see these red arrows. On the left  it's when it's cold and the thermo bimetal is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks  and on the right  the thermo bimetal curls and allows that air to pass through  so those are two different components that I'm working on  and again  it's a completely different thing  because you can imagine that air could potentially be coming through the walls instead of opening windows. So I want to leave you with one last impression about the project  or this kind of work and using smart materials. When you're tired of opening and closing those blinds day after day  when you're on vacation and there's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls  or when there's a power outage  and you have no electricity to rely on  these thermo bimetals will still be working tirelessly  efficiently and endlessly. Thank you.  Applause  Good morning. So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve  to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow. As a cyber magician  I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced. You've probably all heard of Google's Project Glass. It's new technology. You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data  names of places  monuments  buildings  maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street. So these are my illusion glasses. They're a little bigger. They're a prototype. And when you look through them  you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber illusionist. Let me show you what I mean. All we need is a playing card. Any card will do. Like this. And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again. All right. Very significant mark. And let's put it back into the deck  somewhere in the middle  and let's get started. Voice  System ready. Acquiring image. Marco Tempest  For those of you who don't play cards  a deck of cards is made up of four different suits  hearts  clubs  diamonds and spades. The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols  and have been interpreted in many different ways. Now  some say that the four suits represent the four seasons. There's spring  summer  autumn and     Voice  My favorite season is winter.MT  Well yeah  mine too. Winter is like magic. It's a time of change  when warmth turns to cold  water turns to snow  and then it all disappears. There are    cards in each suit.  Music  Voice  Each card represents a phase of the    lunar cycles. MT  So over here is low tide  and over here is high tide  and in the middle is the moon. Voice  The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic. MT  There are two colors in a deck of cards. There is the color red and the color black  representing the constant change from day to night. Voice  Marco  I did not know you could do that.  Laughter  MT  And is it a coincidence that there are    cards in a deck of cards  just as there are    weeks in a year  Voice  If you total all the spots on a deck of cards  the result is    . MT  Oh       the number of days in a year  the number of days between each birthday. Make a wish.  Blowing noise  Voice  Don't tell  or it won't come true. MT  Well  as a matter of fact  it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards  and ever since that day  I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls  men and women  husbands and wives  even kings and queens.  Applause  Voice  And who are these MT  Ah  mischief makers. Watch. Wake up. Joker  Whoa.MT  Are you ready for your party piece  Joker  Ready MT  Let me see what you've got. Joker  Presenting my pogo stick.MT  Ah. Watch out. Joker  Whoa  whoa  whoa  oh   Music  MT  But today  I am performing for a different kind of audience. I'm performing for you. Voice  Signed card detected.MT  Well  sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician  Is it a   to   job  Of course not  You've got to practice     . I don't literally mean    hours  seven days a week.      is a little bit of an exaggeration  but it does take practice. Now  some people will say  well  magic  that must be the work of some evil supernatural force.  Laughter   Applause  Whoa. Well  to this  I just say  no no. Actually  in German  it's nein nein.  Laughter  Magic isn't that intense. I have to warn you  though  if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this  don't play for money. Voice  Why not  That's a very good hand. The odds of getting it are       to one. MT  Yeah  but I guess my hand is better. We beat the odds. Voice  I think you got your birthday wish.MT  And that actually leaves me with the last  and most important card of all  the one with this very significant mark on it. And unlike anything else we've just seen  virtual or not.Voice  Signed card detected. Digital MT  This is without a question the real thing. MT  Bye bye.  Music  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  So little Billy goes to school  and he sits down and the teacher says   What does your father do   And little Billy says   My father plays the piano in an opium den.  So the teacher rings up the parents  and says   Very shocking story from little Billy today. Just heard that he claimed that you play the piano in an opium den.  And the father says   I'm very sorry. Yes  it's true  I lied. But how can I tell an eight year old boy that his father is a politician    Laughter  Now  as a politician myself  standing in front of you  or indeed  meeting any stranger anywhere in the world  when I eventually reveal the nature of my profession  they look at me as though I'm somewhere between a snake  a monkey and an iguana  and through all of this  I feel  strongly  that something is going wrong. Four hundred years of maturing democracy  colleagues in Parliament who seem to me  as individuals  reasonably impressive  an increasingly educated  energetic  informed population  and yet a deep  deep sense of disappointment. My colleagues in Parliament include  in my new intake  family doctors  businesspeople  professors  distinguished economists  historians  writers  army officers ranging from colonels down to regimental sergeant majors. All of them  however  including myself  as we walk underneath those strange stone gargoyles just down the road  feel that we've become less than the sum of our parts  feel as though we have become profoundly diminished. And this isn't just a problem in Britain. It's a problem across the developing world  and in middle income countries too. In Jamaica  for example    look at Jamaican members of Parliament  you meet them  and they're often people who are Rhodes Scholars  who've studied at Harvard or at Princeton  and yet  you go down to downtown Kingston  and you are looking at one of the most depressing sites that you can see in any middle income country in the world  a dismal  depressing landscape of burnt and half abandoned buildings. And this has been true for    years  and the handover in             between one Jamaican leader who was the son of a Rhodes Scholar and a Q.C. to another who'd done an economics doctorate at Harvard  over     people were killed in the streets in drug related violence. Ten years ago  however  the promise of democracy seemed to be extraordinary. George W. Bush stood up in his State of the Union address in      and said that democracy was the force that would beat most of the ills of the world. He said  because democratic governments respect their own people and respect their neighbors  freedom will bring peace. Distinguished academics at the same time argued that democracies had this incredible range of side benefits. They would bring prosperity  security  overcome sectarian violence  ensure that states would never again harbor terrorists. Since then  what's happened  Well  what we've seen is the creation  in places like Iraq and Afghanistan  of democratic systems of government which haven't had any of those side benefits. In Afghanistan  for example  we haven't just had one election or two elections. We've gone through three elections  presidential and parliamentary. And what do we find  Do we find a flourishing civil society  a vigorous rule of law and good security  No. What we find in Afghanistan is a judiciary that is weak and corrupt  a very limited civil society which is largely ineffective  a media which is beginning to get onto its feet but a government that's deeply unpopular  perceived as being deeply corrupt  and security that is shocking  security that's terrible. In Pakistan  in lots of sub Saharan Africa  again you can see democracy and elections are compatible with corrupt governments  with states that are unstable and dangerous. And when I have conversations with people  I remember having a conversation  for example  in Iraq  with a community that asked me whether the riot we were seeing in front of us  this was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building  was a sign of the new democracy. The same  I felt  was true in almost every single one of the middle and developing countries that I went to  and to some extent the same is true of us. Well  what is the answer to this  Is the answer to just give up on the idea of democracy  Well  obviously not. It would be absurd if we were to engage again in the kind of operations we were engaged in  in Iraq and Afghanistan if we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation in which we were imposing anything other than a democratic system. Anything else would run contrary to our values  it would run contrary to the wishes of the people on the ground  it would run contrary to our interests. I remember in Iraq  for example  that we went through a period of feeling that we should delay democracy. We went through a period of feeling that the lesson learned from Bosnia was that elections held too early enshrined sectarian violence  enshrined extremist parties  so in Iraq in      the decision was made  let's not have elections for two years. Let's invest in voter education. Let's invest in democratization. The result was that I found stuck outside my office a huge crowd of people  this is actually a photograph taken in Libya but I saw the same scene in Iraq of people standing outside screaming for the elections  and when I went out and said   What is wrong with the interim provincial council  What is wrong with the people that we have chosen  There is a Sunni sheikh  there's a Shiite sheikh  there's the seven    leaders of the seven major tribes  there's a Christian  there's a Sabian  there are female representatives  there's every political party in this council  what's wrong with the people that we chose   The answer came   The problem isn't the people that you chose. The problem is that you chose them.  I have not met  in Afghanistan  in even the most remote community  anybody who does not want a say in who governs them. Most remote community  I have never met a villager who does not want a vote. So we need to acknowledge that despite the dubious statistics  despite the fact that    percent of people in Britain feel politics is broken  despite the fact that when I was in Iraq  we did an opinion poll in      and asked people what political systems they preferred  and the answer came back that seven percent wanted the United States  five percent wanted France  three percent wanted Britain  and nearly    percent wanted Dubai  which is  after all  not a democratic state at all but a relatively prosperous minor monarchy  democracy is a thing of value for which we should be fighting. But in order to do so we need to get away from instrumental arguments. We need to get away from saying democracy matters because of the other things it brings. We need to get away from feeling  in the same way  human rights matters because of the other things it brings  or women's rights matters for the other things it brings. Why should we get away from those arguments  Because they're very dangerous. If we set about saying  for example  torture is wrong because it doesn't extract good information  or we say  you need women's rights because it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force  you leave yourself open to the position where the government of North Korea can turn around and say   Well actually  we're having a lot of success extracting good information with our torture at the moment   or the government of Saudi Arabia to say   Well  our economic growth's okay  thank you very much  considerably better than yours  so maybe we don't need to go ahead with this program on women's rights.  The point about democracy is not instrumental. It's not about the things that it brings. The point about democracy is not that it delivers legitimate  effective  prosperous rule of law. It's not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors. The point about democracy is intrinsic. Democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty. It reflects an idea of dignity  the dignity of the individual  the idea that each individual should have an equal vote  an equal say  in the formation of their government. But if we're really to make democracy vigorous again  if we're ready to revivify it  we need to get involved in a new project of the citizens and the politicians. Democracy is not simply a question of structures. It is a state of mind. It is an activity. And part of that activity is honesty. After I speak to you today  I'm going on a radio program called  Any Questions   and the thing you will have noticed about politicians on these kinds of radio programs is that they never  ever say that they don't know the answer to a question. It doesn't matter what it is. If you ask about child tax credits  the future of the penguins in the south Antarctic  asked to hold forth on whether or not the developments in Chongqing contribute to sustainable development in carbon capture  and we will have an answer for you. We need to stop that  to stop pretending to be omniscient beings. Politicians also need to learn  occasionally  to say that certain things that voters want  certain things that voters have been promised  may be things that we cannot deliver or perhaps that we feel we should not deliver. And the second thing we should do is understand the genius of our societies. Our societies have never been so educated  have never been so energized  have never been so healthy  have never known so much  cared so much  or wanted to do so much  and it is a genius of the local. One of the reasons why we're moving away from banqueting halls such as the one in which we stand  banqueting halls with extraordinary images on the ceiling of kings enthroned  the entire drama played out here on this space  where the King of England had his head lopped off  why we've moved from spaces like this  thrones like that  towards the town hall  is we're moving more and more towards the energies of our people  and we need to tap that. That can mean different things in different countries. In Britain  it could mean looking to the French  learning from the French  getting directly elected mayors in place in a French commune system. In Afghanistan  it could have meant instead of concentrating on the big presidential and parliamentary elections  we should have done what was in the Afghan constitution from the very beginning  which is to get direct local elections going at a district level and elect people's provincial governors. But for any of these things to work  the honesty in language  the local democracy  it's not just a question of what politicians do. It's a question of what the citizens do. For politicians to be honest  the public needs to allow them to be honest  and the media  which mediates between the politicians and the public  needs to allow those politicians to be honest. If local democracy is to flourish  it is about the active and informed engagement of every citizen. In other words  if democracy is to be rebuilt  is to become again vigorous and vibrant  it is necessary not just for the public to learn to trust their politicians  but for the politicians to learn to trust the public. Thank you very much indeed.  Applause  I grew up in Bihar  India's poorest state  and I remember when I was six years old  I remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep. My brothers and I dug in  and that's when my father came home. He was livid  and I still remember how we cried when that cart with our half eaten sweets was pulled away from us. Later  I understood why my father got so upset. Those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract. My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar  and he had developed a firm stance against corruption  even though he was harassed and threatened. His was a lonely struggle  because Bihar was also India's most corrupt state  where public officials were enriching themselves   rather  than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling. And I experienced this most viscerally when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty. And as I went village to village  I remember one day  when I was famished and exhausted  and I was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree  and just at that time  one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and graciously fed me. Only I later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days. This profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life. I resolved to give back. Later  I joined the World Bank  which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries. My initial work focused on Uganda  where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans. But after we disbursed the loans  I remember a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools without textbooks or teachers  new health clinics without drugs  and the poor once again without any voice or recourse. It was Bihar all over again. Bihar represents the challenge of development  abject poverty surrounded by corruption. Globally   .  billion people live on less than   .   a day  and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practiced since       when winners of World War II      founding fathers  and one lonely founding mother  gathered in New Hampshire  USA  to establish the Bretton Woods institutions  including the World Bank. And that traditional approach to development had three key elements. First  transfer of resources from rich countries in the North to poorer countries in the South  accompanied by reform prescriptions. Second  the development institutions that channeled these transfers were opaque  with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved. And third  the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens  who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance. Today  each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment. Open knowledge  open aid  open governance  and together  they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar. The first key shift is open knowledge. You know  developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the U.S.  Europe or the World Bank. They get their inspiration  their hope  their practical know how  from successful emerging economies in the South. They want to know how China lifted     million people out of poverty in    years  how Mexico's Oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children. This is the new ecosystem of open knowledge flows  not just traveling North to South  but South to South  and even South to North  with Mexico's Oportunidades today inspiring New York City. And just as these North to South transfers are opening up  so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers. This is the second shift  open aid. Recently  the World Bank opened its vault of data for public use  releasing       economic and social indicators for     countries over    years  and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data. Development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance. Take GeoMapping. In this map from Kenya  the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located  and the darker the shade of green  the more the number of out of school children. So this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out of school children  provoking new questions. Is development assistance targeting those who most need our help  In this manner  the World Bank has now GeoMapped        project activities in     countries  and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects. This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid. And this leads me to the third  and in my view  the most significant shift in development  open governance. Governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability. From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India  using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability. Are governments delivering services to the citizens  So for instance  several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public. But  you know  there is a big difference between a budget that's public and a budget that's accessible. This is a public budget.  Laughter  And as you can see  it's not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources. To tackle this problem  governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it's more understandable to the public. In this map from Moldova  the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes  and the red color shows the opposite. Tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual  and what's exciting is that with this openness  there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government. So in the Philippines today  parents and students can give real time feedback on a website  Checkmyschool.org  or using SMS  whether teachers and textbooks are showing up in school  the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar. And the government is responsive. So for instance  when it was reported on this website that     students were at risk because school repairs had stalled due to corruption  the Department of Education in the Philippines took swift action. And you know what's exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South  from the Philippines to Indonesia  Kenya  Moldova and beyond. In Dar es Salaam  Tanzania  even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations. This is what the map of Tandale looked like in August      . But within a few weeks  university students were able to use mobile phones and an open source platform to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure. And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working  aggregated in the red bubbles that you see  which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor. Today  even Bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent  accessible and responsive to the poor. But  you know  in many parts of the world  governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor  and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system. These are the lonely warriors like my father and many  many others  and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds. So for instance  today  in Ghana  courageous reformers from civil society  Parliament and government  have forged a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector  and  galvanized by this  reformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts. These examples give new hope  new possibility to the problems I witnessed in Uganda or that my father confronted in Bihar. Two years ago  on April  th        I called my father. It was very late at night  and at age     he was typing a    page public interest litigation against corruption in a road project. Though he was no lawyer  he argued the case in court himself the next day. He won the ruling  but later that very evening  he fell  and he died. He fought till the end  increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty  not only did government officials need to be honest  but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard. These became the two bookends of his life  and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape. Today  I'm inspired by these changes  and I'm excited that at the World Bank  we are embracing these new directions  a significant departure from my work in Uganda    years ago. We need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions  inspiring practitioners  so aid becomes transparent  accountable and effective  so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers in government. We need to accelerate these shifts. If we do  we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bihar  in Uganda  and beyond. We will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children. We will find that these children  too  have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty. Thank you.  Applause  What I want you all to do right now is to think of this mammal that I'm going to describe to you. The first thing I'm going to tell you about this mammal is that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly. If we remove this mammal from our ecosystems  they simply will not work. That's the first thing. The second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities of this mammal  if we study this mammal  we're going to get great insight into our diseases of the senses  such as blindness and deafness. And the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal is that I fully believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies deep within its DNA. So are you all thinking  So  magnificent creature  isn't it  Who here thought of a bat  Ah  I can see half the audience agrees with me  and I have a lot of work to do to convince the rest of you. So I have had the good fortune for the past    years to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals. One fifth of all living mammals is a bat  and they have very unique attributes. Bats as we know them have been around on this planet for about    million years. One of the most unique things that bats do as a mammal is that they fly. Now flight is an inherently difficult thing. Flight within vertebrates has only evolved three times  once in the bats  once in the birds  and once in the pterodactyls. And so with flight  it's very metabolically costly. Bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this. But one other extremely unique thing about bats is that they are able to use sound to perceive their environment. They use echolocation. Now  what I mean by echolocation    they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth or through their nose. This sound wave comes out and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment  and the bats then hear these echoes and they turn this information into an acoustic image. And this enables them to orient in complete darkness. Indeed  they do look very strange. We're humans. We're a visual species. When scientists first realized that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night  we didn't believe it. For a hundred years  despite evidence to show that this is what they were doing  we didn't believe it. Now  if you look at this bat  it looks a little bit alien. Indeed  the very famous philosopher Thomas Nagel once said   To truly experience an alien life form on this planet  you should lock yourself inside a room with a flying  echolocating bat in complete darkness.  And if you look at the actual physical characteristics on the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat  you see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated to be able to make sound and perceive it. Very big ears  strange nose leaves  but teeny tiny eyes. So again  if you just look at this bat  you realize sound is very important for its survival. Most bats look like the previous one. However  there are a group that do not use echolocation. They do not perceive their environment using sound  and these are the flying foxes. If anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in Australia  you've seen them coming out of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney  and if you just look at their face  you can see they have much  much larger eyes and much smaller ears. So among and within bats is a huge variation in their ability to use sensory perception. Now this is going to be important for what I'm going to tell you later during the talk. Now  if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you  and I know some people probably are feeling a little sick looking at very large images of bats  that's probably not that surprising  because here in Western culture  bats have been demonized. Really  of course the famous book  Dracula   written by a fellow Northside Dubliner Bram Stoker  probably is mainly responsible for this. However  I also think it's got to do with the fact that bats come out at night  and we don't really understand them. We're a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us. Bats are usually synonymous with some type of evil events. They are the perpetrators in horror movies  such as this famous  Nightwing.  Also  if you think about it  demons always have bat wings  whereas birds  they typically    or angels have bird wings. Now  this is Western society  and what I hope to do tonight is to convince you of the Chinese traditional culture  that they perceive bats as creatures that bring good luck  and indeed  if you walk into a Chinese home  you may see an image such as this. This is considered the Five Blessings. The Chinese word for  bat  sounds like the Chinese word for  happiness   and they believe that bats bring wealth  health  longevity  virtue and serenity. And indeed  in this image  you have a picture of longevity surrounded by five bats. And what I want to do tonight is to talk to you and to show you that at least three of these blessings are definitely represented by a bat  and that if we study bats we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings. So  wealth    how can a bat possibly bring us wealth  Now as I said before  bats are essential for our ecosystems to function correctly. And why is this  Bats in the tropics are major pollinators of many plants. They also feed on fruit  and they disperse the seeds of these fruits. Bats are responsible for pollinating the tequila plant  and this is a multi million dollar industry in Mexico. So indeed  we need them for our ecosystems to function properly. Without them  it's going to be a problem. But most bats are voracious insect predators. It's been estimated in the U.S.  in a tiny colony of big brown bats  that they will feed on over a million insects a year  and in the United States of America  right now bats are being threatened by a disease known as white nose syndrome. It's working its way slowly across the U.S. and wiping out populations of bats  and scientists have estimated that       metric tons of insects a year are now remaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats. Bats are also threatened in the U.S. by their attraction to wind farms. Again  right now bats are looking at a little bit of a problem. They're going to    They are very threatened in the United States of America alone. Now how can this help us  Well  it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats from the equation  we're going to have to then use insecticides to remove all those pest insects that feed on our agricultural crops. And for one year in the U.S. alone  it's estimated that it's going to cost    billion U.S. dollars  if we remove bats. So indeed  bats then do bring us wealth. They maintain the health of our ecosystems  and also they save us money. So again  that's the first blessing. Bats are important for our ecosystems. And what about the second  What about health  Inside every cell in your body lies your genome. Your genome is made up of your DNA  your DNA codes for proteins that enable you to function and interact and be as you are. Now since the new advancements in modern molecular technologies  it is now possible for us to sequence our own genome in a very rapid time and at a very  very reduced cost. Now when we've been doing this  we've realized that there's variations within our genome. So I want you to look at the person beside you. Just have a quick look. And what we need to realize is that every     base pairs in your DNA  you're a little bit different. And one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases  or does this variation just make you different  Again  what does it mean here  What does this variation actually mean  So if we are to capitalize on all of this new molecular data and personalized genomic information that is coming online that we will be able to have in the next few years  we have to be able to differentiate between the two. So how do we do this  Well  I believe we just look at nature's experiments. So through natural selection  over time  mutations  variations that disrupt the function of a protein will not be tolerated over time. Evolution acts as a sieve. It sieves out the bad variation. And so therefore  if you look at the same region of a genome in many mammals that have been evolutionarily distant from each other and are also ecologically divergent  you will get a better understanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is  i.e.  if it is important for the mammal to function  for its survival  it will be the same in all of those different lineages  species  taxa. So therefore  if we were to do this  what we'd need to do is sequence that region in all these different mammals and ascertain if it's the same or if it's different. So if it is the same  this indicates that that site is important for a function  so a disease mutation should fall within that site. So in this case here  if all the mammals that we look at have a yellow type genome at that site  it probably suggests that purple is bad. This could be even more powerful if you look at mammals that are doing things slightly differently. So say  for example  the region of the genome that I was looking at was a region that's important for vision. If we look at that region in mammals that don't see so well  such as bats  and we find that bats that don't see so well have the purple type  we know that this is probably what's causing this disease. So in my lab  we've been using bats to look at two different types of diseases of the senses. We're looking at blindness. Now why would you do this  Three hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired  and    million of these are blind. So blindness is a big problem  and a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases  so we want to try and better understand which mutations in the gene cause the disease. Also we look at deafness. One in every       newborn babies are deaf  and when we reach     over half of us will also have a hearing problem. Again  there's many underlying genetic causes for this. So what we've been doing in my lab is looking at these unique sensory specialists  the bats  and we have looked at genes that cause blindness when there's a defect in them  genes that cause deafness when there's a defect in them  and now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease. So bats are also important for our health  to enable us to better understand how our genome functions. So this is where we are right now  but what about the future  What about longevity  This is where we're going to go  and as I said before  I really believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies within the bat genome. So why should we be interested in aging at all  Well  really  this is a picture drawn from the     s of the Fountain of Youth. Aging is considered one of the most familiar  yet the least well understood  aspects of all of biology  and really  since the dawn of civilization  mankind has sought to avoid it. But we are going to have to understand it a bit better. In Europe alone  by       there is going to be a    percent increase of individuals over     and     percent increase in individuals over   . As we age  we deteriorate  and this deterioration causes problems for our society  so we have to address it. So how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie within the bat genome  Does anybody want to hazard a guess over how long this bat could live for  Who    put up your hands    who says two years  Nobody  One  How about    years  Some  How about     How about     Okay  it's a whole varied response. This bat is myotis brandtii. It's the longest living bat. It lived for up to    years  and this bat's still alive in the wild today. But what would be so amazing about this  Well  typically  in mammals there is a relationship between body size  metabolic rate  and how long you can live for  and you can predict how long a mammal can live for given its body size. So typically  small mammals live fast  die young. Think of a mouse. But bats are very different. As you can see here on this graph  in blue  these are all other mammals  but bats can live up to nine times longer than expected despite having a really  really high metabolic rate  and the question is  how can they do that  There are    species of mammal that live longer than expected  given their body size  than man  and    of those are bats. So therefore  they must have something within their DNA that ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses  particularly of flight. They expend three times more energy than a mammal of the same size  but don't seem to suffer the consequences or the effects. So right now  in my lab  we're combining state of the art bat field biology  going out and catching the long lived bats  with the most up to date  modern molecular technology to understand better what it is that they do to stop aging as we do. And hopefully in the next five years  I'll be giving you a TEDTalk on that. Aging is a big problem for humanity  and I believe that by studying bats  we can uncover the molecular mechanisms that enable mammals to achieve extraordinary longevity. If we find out what they're doing  perhaps through gene therapy  we can enable us to do the same thing. Potentially  this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it. Just imagine what that would be like. So really  I don't think we should be thinking of them as flying demons of the night  but more as our superheroes. And the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit if we just look in the right place. They're good for our ecosystem  they allow us to understand how our genome functions  and they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth. So tonight  when you walk out of here and you look up in the night skies  and you see this beautiful flying mammal  I want you to smile. Thank you.  Applause  I think the beautiful Malin  Akerman  put it perfectly. Every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury. Ladies and gentlemen  and more importantly  Mo Bros and Mo Sistas    Laughter    for the next    minutes  I'm going to share with you my Movember journey  and how  through that journey  we've redefined charity  we're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world  and I hope  through that process  that I inspire you to create something significant in your life  something significant that will go on and make this world a better place. So the most common question I get asked  and I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it over drinks tonight  is how did this come about  How did Movember start  Well  normally  a charity starts with the cause  and someone that is directly affected by a cause. They then go on to create an event  and beyond that  a foundation to support that. Pretty much in every case  that's how a charity starts. Not so with Movember. Movember started in a very traditional Australian way. It was on a Sunday afternoon. I was with my brother and a mate having a few beers  and I was watching the world go by  had a few more beers  and the conversation turned to '  s fashion    Laughter    and how everything manages to come back into style. And a few more beers  I said   There has to be some stuff that hasn't come back.   Laughter  Then one more beer and it was  whatever happened to the mustache  Why hasn't that made a comeback   Laughter  So then there was a lot more beers  and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back.  Laughter  So in Australia   mo  is slang for mustache  so we renamed the month of November  Movember  and created some pretty basic rules  which still stand today. And they are  start the month clean shaven  rock a mustache    not a beard  not a goatee  a mustache    for the    days of November  and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month  have a mustache themed party  and award a prize for the best  and of course  the worst mustache.  Laughter  Now trust me  when you're growing a mustache back in       and there were    of us back then  and this was before the ironic hipster mustache movement    Laughter    it created a lot of controversy.  Laughter  So my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients. My girlfriend at the time  who's no longer my girlfriend    Laughter    hated it. Parents would shuffle kids away from us.  Laughter  But we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey  and it was a real journey. And we had a lot of fun  and in       I said to the guys   That was so much fun. We need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year.   Laughter  So we started thinking about that  and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer. And we thought  you know what  there's nothing for men's health. Why is that  Why can't we combine growing a mustache and doing something for men's health  And I started to research that topic  and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed with it. But there was nothing for this cause  so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer  and then we created our tagline  which is   Changing the face of men's health.  And that eloquently describes the challenge  changing your appearance for the    days  and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve  getting men engaged in their health  having them have a better understanding about the health risks that they face. So with that model  I then cold called the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation. I said to him   I've got the most amazing idea that's going to transform your organization.   Laughter  And I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone  so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne in     . And we sat down  and I shared with him my vision of getting men growing mustaches across Australia  raising awareness for this cause  and funds for his organization. And I needed a partnership to legitimately do that. And I said   We're going to come together at the end  we're going to have a mustache themed party  we're going to have DJs  we're going to celebrate life  and we're going to change the face of men's health.  And he just looked at me and laughed  and he said  he said   Adam  that's a really novel idea  but we're an ultraconservative organization. We can't have anything to do with you.   Laughter  So I paid for coffee that day    Laughter    and his parting comment as we shook hands was   Listen  if you happen to raise any money out of this  we'll gladly take it.   Laughter  So my lesson that year was persistence. And we persisted  and we got     guys growing mustaches  and together we raised        dollars  and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia  and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they'd ever received. So from that day forward  my life has become about a mustache. Every day    this morning  I wake up and go  my life is about a mustache.  Laughter  Essentially  I'm a mustache farmer.  Laughter  And my season is November.  Applause  So in       the campaign got more momentum  was more successful in Australia and then New Zealand  and then in      we came to a pivotal point. It was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought  we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund Movember so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level. It's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches.  Laughter  Let me tell you that there's not too many people interested in investing in that  not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation  who we'd raised about  .  million dollars for at that stage. So again we persisted  and Foster's Brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever sponsorship  and that was enough for me to quit my job  I did consulting on the side. And leading into Movember       we'd run through all the money from Foster's  we'd run through all the money I had  and essentially we had no money left  and we'd convinced all our suppliers    creative agencies  web development agencies  hosting companies  whatnot    to delay their billing until December. So we'd racked up at this stage about         dollars worth of debt. So if Movember      didn't happen  the four founders  well  we would've been broke  we would've been homeless  sitting on the street with mustaches.  Laughter  But we thought  you know what  if that's the worst thing that happens  so what  We're going to have a lot of fun doing it  and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks. Then in early       a really interesting thing happened. We had Mo Bros from Canada  from the U.S.  and from the U.K. emailing us and calling us and saying  hey  there's nothing for prostate cancer. Bring this campaign to these countries. So we thought  why not  Let's do it. So I cold called the CEO of Prostate Cancer Canada  and I said to him   I have this most amazing concept.   It's going to transform your organization. I don't want to tell you about it now  but will you meet with me if I fly all the way to Toronto   So I flew here  met down on Front Street East  and we sat in the boardroom  and I said   Right  here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization.  And he looked at me and laughed and said   Adam  sounds like a really novel idea  but we're an ultraconservative organization.   Laughter  I've heard this before. I know how it goes. But he said   We will partner with you  but we're not going to invest in it. You need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work.  So what we did was  we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country  the U.S  and the U.K.  and we did that because we knew  if this was successful  we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in Australia. And that money fuels research  and that research will get us to a cure. And we're not about finding an Australian cure or a Canadian cure  we're about finding the cure. So in       we brought the campaign across here  and it was  it set the stage for the campaign. It wasn't as successful as we thought it would be. We were sort of very gung ho with our success in Australia and New Zealand at that stage. So that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets. But what I'm really pleased to say is  in       Movember became a truly global movement. Canada was just pipped to the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world. Last year we had         Mo Bros spread across the world and together we raised    million dollars. And that makes Movember now the biggest funder of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world. And that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches.  Laughter  And for us  we have redefined charity. Our ribbon is a hairy ribbon.  Laughter  Our ambassadors are the Mo Bros and the Mo Sistas  and I think that's been fundamental to our success. We hand across our brand and our campaign to those people. We let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way. So now I live in Los Angeles  because the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the U.S. is based there  and I always get asked by the media down there  because it's so celebrity driven   Who are your celebrity ambassadors   And I say to them   Last year we were fortunate enough to have         celebrity ambassadors.  And they go   What  what do you mean   And it's like  everything single person  every single Mo Bro and Mo Sista that participates in Movember is our celebrity ambassador  and that is so  so important and fundamental to our success. Now what I want to share with you is one of my most touching Movember moments  and it happened here in Toronto last year  at the end of the campaign. I was out with a team. It was the end of Movember. We'd had a great campaign  and to be honest  we'd had our fair share of beer that night  but I said   You know what  I think we've got one more bar left in us.   Laughter  So we piled into a taxi  and this is our taxi driver  and I was sitting in the back seat  and he turned around and said   Where are you going   And I said   Hang on  that is an amazing mustache.  And he said   I'm doing it for Movember.  And I said   So am I.  And I said   Tell me your Movember story.  And he goes   Listen  I know it's about men's health  I know it's about prostate cancer  but this is for breast cancer.  And I said   Okay  that's interesting.  And he goes   Last year  my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka  because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her   and he said   This mustache is my tribute to my mom.  And we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi  and I didn't tell him who I was  because I didn't think it was appropriate  and I just shook his hand and I said   Thank you so much. Your mom would be so proud.  And from that moment I realized that Movember is so much more than a mustache  having a joke. It's about each person coming to this platform  embracing it in their own way  and being significant in their own life. For us now at Movember  we really focus on three program areas  and having a true impact  awareness and education  survivor support programs  and research. Now we always focus  naturally  on how much we raise  because it's a very tangible outcome  but for me  awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise  because I know that is changing and saving lives today  and it's probably best exampled by a young guy that I met at South by Southwest in Austin  Texas  at the start of the year. He came up to me and said   Thank you for starting Movember.  And I said   Thank you for doing Movember.  And I looked at him  and I was like   I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache.   Laughter  And I said   What's your Movember story   And he said   I grew the worst mustache ever.   Laughter   But I went home for Thanksgiving dinner  and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on.   Laughter   And we talked    I talked to them about Movember  and then after that  my dad came up to me  and at the age of     for the first time ever  I had a conversation with my dad one on one about men's health. I had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer  and I learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and I was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease  and he didn't know that  and he hadn't been getting screened for it.  So now  that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer. So those conversations  getting men engaged in this  at whatever age  is so critically important  and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise. Now to the funds we raise  and research  and how we're redefining research. We fund prostate cancer foundations now in    countries. We literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions and researchers around the world  and when we looked at this more recently  we realized there's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions  let alone nationally  let alone globally  and this is not unique to prostate cancer. This is cancer research the world over. And so we said  right  we'd redefined charity. We need to redefine the way these guys operate. How do we do that  So what we did was  we created a global action plan  and we're taking    percent of what's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund  and we've got the best prostate cancer scientific minds in the world that look after that fund  and they come together each year and identify the number one priority  and that  last year  was getting a better screening test. So they identified that as a priority  and then they've got and recruited now     researchers from around the world that are studying that topic  essentially the same topic. So now we're funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together  and that's a unique thing in the cancer world  and we know  through that collaboration  it will accelerate outcomes. And that's how we're redefining the research world. So  what I know about my Movember journey is that  with a really creative idea  with passion  with persistence  and a lot of patience  four mates  four mustaches  can inspire a room full of people  and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city  and that city is Melbourne  my home. And that city can go on and inspire a state  and that state can go on and inspire a nation  and beyond that  you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men's health. My name is Adam Garone  and that's my story. Thank you.  Applause  Today I have just one request. Please don't tell me I'm normal. Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers. Remi is     tall and very handsome. He's speechless  but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot. Remi knows what love is. He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless. He's not greedy. He doesn't see skin color. He doesn't care about religious differences  and get this  He has never told a lie. When he sings songs from our childhood  attempting words that not even I could remember  he reminds me of one thing  how little we know about the mind  and how wonderful the unknown must be. Samuel is   . He's tall. He's very handsome. He has the most impeccable memory. He has a selective one  though. He doesn't remember if he stole my chocolate bar  but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod  conversations we had when he was four  weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies  and Lady Gaga's birthday. Don't they sound incredible  But most people don't agree. And in fact  because their minds don't fit into society's version of normal  they're often bypassed and misunderstood. But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case  although they were not seen as ordinary  this could only mean one thing  that they were extraordinary    autistic and extraordinary. Now  for you who may be less familiar with the term  autism   it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication  learning and sometimes physical skills. It manifests in each individual differently  hence why Remi is so different from Sam. And across the world  every    minutes  one new person is diagnosed with autism  and although it's one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world  there is no known cause or cure. And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism  but I cannot recall a day without it. I was just three years old when my brother came along  and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life. And after a few months went by  I realized that he was different. He screamed a lot. He didn't want to play like the other babies did  and in fact  he didn't seem very interested in me whatsoever. Remi lived and reigned in his own world  with his own rules  and he found pleasure in the smallest things  like lining up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between. And as he grew older  he grew more different  and the differences became more obvious. Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration and the never ending hyperactivity was something really unique  a pure and innocent nature  a boy who saw the world without prejudice  a human who had never lied. Extraordinary. Now  I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family  moments where I've wished that they were just like me. But I cast my mind back to the things that they've taught me about individuality and communication and love  and I realize that these are things that I wouldn't want to change with normality. Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us  and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong. It just means that there's a different kind of right. And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you  it would be that you don't have to be normal. You can be extraordinary. Because autistic or not  the differences that we have    We've got a gift  Everyone's got a gift inside of us  and in all honesty  the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential. The chance for greatness  for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else. Please    don't tell me I'm normal. Thank you.  Applause  So  people want a lot of things out of life  but I think  more than anything else  they want happiness. Aristotle called happiness  the chief good   the end towards which all other things aim. According to this view  the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable. It's that we expect them to bring us happiness. Now in the last    years  we Americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want. We're richer. We live longer. We have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago. The paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically  we haven't actually gotten any happier. Maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness  there's been an increased interest in recent years in happiness itself. People have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time  in fact for thousands of years  but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved. Well  as with many other domains in life  I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question. In fact  in the last few years  there's been an explosion in research on happiness. For example  we've learned a lot about its demographics  how things like income and education  gender and marriage relate to it. But one of the puzzles this has revealed is that factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect. Yes  it's better to make more money rather than less  or to graduate from college instead of dropping out  but the differences in happiness tend to be small. Which leaves the question  what are the big causes of happiness  I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet  but I think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment to moment experiences. It certainly seems that we're going about our lives  that what we're doing  who we're with  what we're thinking about  have a big influence on our happiness  and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult  in fact almost impossible  for scientists to study. A few years ago  I came up with a way to study people's happiness moment to moment as they're going about their daily lives on a massive scale all over the world  something we'd never been able to do before. Called trackyourhappiness.org  it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real time. How does this work  Basically  I send people signals at random points throughout the day  and then I ask them a bunch of questions about their moment to moment experience at the instant just before the signal. The idea is that  if we can watch how people's happiness goes up and down over the course of the day  minute to minute in some cases  and try to understand how what people are doing  who they're with  what they're thinking about  and all the other factors that describe our day  how those might relate to those changes in happiness  we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness. We've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data  a lot more data of this kind than I think has ever been collected before  over         real time reports from over        people. And it's not just a lot of people  it's a really diverse group  people from a wide range of ages  from    to late   s  a wide range of incomes  education levels  people who are married  divorced  widowed  etc. They collectively represent every one of    occupational categories and hail from over    countries. What I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been investigating  and that's mind wandering. As human beings  we have this unique ability to have our minds stray away from the present. This guy is sitting here working on his computer  and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month  wondering what he's going to have for dinner. Maybe he's worried that he's going bald.  Laughter  This ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing. It allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can. And yet it's not clear what the relationship is between our use of this ability and our happiness. You've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present.  Be here now   you've probably heard a hundred times. Maybe  to really be happy  we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment. Maybe these people are right. Maybe mind wandering is a bad thing. On the other hand  when our minds wander  they're unconstrained. We can't change the physical reality in front of us  but we can go anywhere in our minds. Since we know people want to be happy  maybe when our minds wander  they're going to someplace happier than the place that they're leaving. It would make a lot of sense. In other words  maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind wandering. Well  since I'm a scientist  I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data  and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I ask with Track Your Happiness. Remember  this is from sort of moment to moment experience in people's real lives. There are three questions. The first one is a happiness question  How do you feel  on a scale ranging from very bad to very good  Second  an activity question  What are you doing  on a list of    different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV  And finally a mind wandering question  Are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing  People could say no    in other words  I'm focused only on my task    or yes    I am thinking about something else    and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant  neutral or unpleasant. Any of those yes responses are what we called mind wandering. So what did we find  This graph shows happiness on the vertical axis  and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they're focused on the present  when they're not mind wandering. As it turns out  people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they're not. Now you might look at this result and say  okay  sure  on average people are less happy when they're mind wandering  but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with  at least then mind wandering should be doing something good for us. Nope. As it turns out  people are less happy when they're mind wandering no matter what they're doing. For example  people don't really like commuting to work very much. It's one of their least enjoyable activities  and yet they are substantially happier when they're focused only on their commute than when their mind is going off to something else. It's amazing. So how could this be happening  I think part of the reason  a big part of the reason  is that when our minds wander  we often think about unpleasant things  and they are enormously less happy when they do that  our worries  our anxieties  our regrets  and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral  they're still considerably less happy than when they're not mind wandering at all. Even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant  they're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren't mind wandering. If mind wandering were a slot machine  it would be like having the chance to lose    dollars     dollars or one dollar. Right  You'd never want to play.  Laughter  So I've been talking about this  suggesting  perhaps  that mind wandering causes unhappiness  but all I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated. It's possible that's the case  but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy  then they mind wander. Maybe that's what's really going on. How could we ever disentangle these two possibilites  Well  one fact that we can take advantage of  I think a fact you'll all agree is true  is that time goes forward  not backward. Right  The cause has to come before the effect. We're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person  and so we can look and see  does mind wandering tend to precede unhappiness  or does unhappiness tend to precede mind wandering  to get some insight into the causal direction. As it turns out  there is a strong relationship between mind wandering now and being unhappy a short time later  consistent with the idea that mind wandering is causing people to be unhappy. In contrast  there's no relationship between being unhappy now and mind wandering a short time later. In other words  mind wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause  and not merely a consequence  of unhappiness. A few minutes ago  I likened mind wandering to a slot machine you'd never want to play. Well  how often do people's minds wander  Turns out  they wander a lot. In fact  really a lot. Forty seven percent of the time  people are thinking about something other than what they're currently doing. How does that depend on what people are doing  This shows the rate of mind wandering across    activities ranging from a high of    percent    Laughter    when people are taking a shower  brushing their teeth  to    percent when they're working  to    percent when they're exercising  all the way down to this one short bar on the right that I think some of you are probably laughing at. Ten percent of the time people's minds are wandering when they're having sex.  Laughter  But there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph  and that is  basically with one exception  no matter what people are doing  they're mind wandering at least    percent of the time  which suggests  I think  that mind wandering isn't just frequent  it's ubiquitous. It pervades basically everything that we do. In my talk today  I've told you a little bit about mind wandering  a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness. My hope is that over time  by tracking people's moment to moment happiness and their experiences in daily life  we'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness  and then in the end  a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that's not only richer and healthier  but happier as well. Thank you.  Applause  Two years ago  after having served four years in the United States Marine Corps and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan  I found myself in Port au Prince  leading a team of veterans and medical professionals in some of the hardest hit areas of that city  three days after the earthquake. We were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go  the places nobody else could go  and after three weeks  we realized something. Military veterans are very  very good at disaster response. And coming home  my cofounder and I  we looked at it  and we said  there are two problems. The first problem is there's inadequate disaster response. It's slow. It's antiquated. It's not using the best technology  and it's not using the best people. The second problem that we became aware of was a very inadequate veteran reintegration  and this is a topic that is front page news right now as veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan  and they're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life. And we sat here and we looked at these two problems  and finally we came to a realization. These aren't problems. These are actually solutions. And what do I mean by that  Well  we can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home. Recent surveys show that    percent of veterans want to continue their service when they take off their uniform. And we can use veterans to improve disaster response. Now on the surface  this makes a lot of sense  and in       we responded to the tsunami in Chile  the floods in Pakistan  we sent training teams to the Thai Burma border. But it was earlier this year  when one of our original members caused us to shift focus in the organization. This is Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine with me. We served together in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay was with us in Port au Prince. He was also with us in Chile. Earlier this year  in March  Clay took his own life. This was a tragedy  but it really forced us to refocus what it is that we were doing. You know  Clay didn't kill himself because of what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay killed himself because of what he lost when he came home. He lost purpose. He lost his community. And perhaps most tragically  he lost his self worth. And so  as we evaluated  and as the dust settled from this tragedy  we realized that  of those two problems    in the initial iteration of our organization  we were a disaster response organization that was using veteran service. We had a lot of success  and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm. But after Clay  we shifted that focus  and suddenly  now moving forward  we see ourselves as a veteran service organization that's using disaster response. Because we think that we can give that purpose and that community and that self worth back to the veteran. And tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin  and then later Hurricane Irene  gave us an opportunity to look at that. Now I want you to imagine for a second an    year old boy who graduates from high school in Kansas City  Missouri. He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle. They send him to Iraq. Every day he leaves the wire with a mission. That mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home. It's to keep the men around him alive. It's to pacify the village that he works in. He's got a purpose. But he comes home  to  Kansas City  Missouri  maybe he goes to college  maybe he's got a job  but he doesn't have that same sense of purpose. You give him a chainsaw. You send him to Joplin  Missouri after a tornado  he regains that. Going back  that same    year old boy graduates from high school in Kansas City  Missouri  joins the Army  the Army gives him a rifle  they send him to Iraq. Every day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him. He leaves the wire. He knows that those people have his back. He's slept in the same sand. They've lived together. They've eaten together. They've bled together. He goes home to Kansas City  Missouri. He gets out of the military. He takes his uniform off. He doesn't have that community anymore. But you drop    of those veterans in Joplin  Missouri  they get that sense of community back. Again  you have an    year old boy who graduates high school in Kansas City. He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle. They send him to Iraq. They pin a medal on his chest. He goes home to a ticker tape parade. He takes the uniform off. He's no longer Sergeant Jones in his community. He's now Dave from Kansas City. He doesn't have that same self worth. But you send him to Joplin after a tornado  and somebody once again is walking up to him and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service  now they have self worth again. I think it's very important  because right now somebody needs to step up  and this generation of veterans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance. Thank you very much.  Applause  So I want to talk a little bit about seeing the world from a totally unique point of view  and this world I'm going to talk about is the micro world. I've found  after doing this for many  many years  that there's a magical world behind reality. And that can be seen directly through a microscope  and I'm going to show you some of this today. So let's start off looking at something rather not so small  something that we can see with our naked eye  and that's a bee. So when you look at this bee  it's about this size here  it's about a centimeter. But to really see the details of the bee  and really appreciate what it is  you have to look a little bit closer. So that's just the eye of the bee with a microscope  and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia  and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes so they know when they're right up close to something  because they can't see in stereo. As we go smaller  here is a human hair. A human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see. It's about a tenth of a millimeter. And as we go smaller again  about ten times smaller than that  is a cell. So you could fit    human cells across the diameter of a human hair. So when we would look at cells  this is how I really got involved in biology and science is by looking at living cells in the microscope. When I first saw living cells in a microscope  I was absolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like. So if you look at the cell like that from the immune system  they're actually moving all over the place. This cell is looking for foreign objects  bacteria  things that it can find. And it's looking around  and when it finds something  and recognizes it being foreign  it will actually engulf it and eat it. So if you look right there  it finds that little bacterium  and it engulfs it and eats it. If you take some heart cells from an animal  and put it in a dish  they'll just sit there and beat. That's their job. Every cell has a mission in life  and these cells  the mission is to move blood around our body. These next cells are nerve cells  and right now  as we see and understand what we're looking at  our brains and our nerve cells are actually doing this right now. They're not just static. They're moving around making new connections  and that's what happens when we learn. As you go farther down this scale here  that's a micron  or a micrometer  and we go all the way down to here to a nanometer and an angstrom. Now  an angstrom is the size of the diameter of a hydrogen atom. That's how small that is. And microscopes that we have today can actually see individual atoms. So these are some pictures of individual atoms. Each bump here is an individual atom. This is a ring of cobalt atoms. So this whole world  the nano world  this area in here is called the nano world  and the nano world  the whole micro world that we see  there's a nano world that is wrapped up within that  and the whole    and that is the world of molecules and atoms. But I want to talk about this larger world  the world of the micro world. So if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower  what would that flower look like  if the flower was this big  It wouldn't look or feel like anything that we see when we look at a flower. So if you look at this flower here  and you're a little bug  if you're on that surface of that flower  that's what the terrain would look like. The petal of that flower looks like that  so the ant is kind of crawling over these objects  and if you look a little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here  this is the style of that flower  and you notice that it's got these little    these are like little jelly like things that are what are called spurs. These are nectar spurs. So this little ant that's crawling here  it's like it's in a little Willy Wonka land. It's like a little Disneyland for them. It's not like what we see. These are little bits of individual grain of pollen there and there  and here is a    what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen  when you look in a microscope  it's actually made of thousands of little grains of pollen. So this  for example  when you see bees flying around these little plants  and they're collecting pollen  those pollen grains that they're collecting  they pack into their legs and they take it back to the hive  and that's what makes the beehive  the wax in the beehive. And they're also collecting nectar  and that's what makes the honey that we eat. Here's a close up picture  or this is actually a regular picture of a water hyacinth  and if you had really  really good vision  with your naked eye  you'd see it about that well. There's the stamen and the pistil. But look what the stamen and the pistil look like in a microscope. That's the stamen. So that's thousands of little grains of pollen there  and there's the pistil there  and these are the little things called trichomes. And that's what makes the flower give a fragrance  and plants actually communicate with one another through their fragrances. I want to talk about something really ordinary  just ordinary sand. I became interested in sand about    years ago  when I first saw sand from Maui  and in fact  this is a little bit of sand from Maui. So sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size. Each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size. But when you look closer at this  look at what's there. It's really quite amazing. You have microshells there. You have things like coral. You have fragments of other shells. You have olivine. You have bits of a volcano. There's a little bit of a volcano there. You have tube worms. An amazing array of incredible things exist in sand. And the reason that is  is because in a place like this island  a lot of the sand is made of biological material because the reefs provide a place where all these microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow  and when they die  their shells and their teeth and their bones break up and they make grains of sand  things like coral and so forth. So here's  for example  a picture of sand from Maui. This is from Lahaina  and when we're walking along a beach  we're actually walking along millions of years of biological and geological history. We don't realize it  but it's actually a record of that entire ecology. So here we see  for example  a sponge spicule  two bits of coral here  that's a sea urchin spine. Really some amazing stuff. So when I first looked at this  I was    I thought  gee  this is like a little treasure trove here. I couldn't believe it  and I'd go around dissecting the little bits out and making photographs of them. Here's what most of the sand in our world looks like. These are quartz crystals and feldspar  so most sand in the world on the mainland is made of quartz crystal and feldspar. It's the erosion of granite rock. So mountains are built up  and they erode away by water and rain and ice and so forth  and they become grains of sand. There's some sand that's really much more colorful. These are sand from near the Great Lakes  and you can see that it's filled with minerals like pink garnet and green epidote  all kinds of amazing stuff  and if you look at different sands from different places  every single beach  every single place you look at sand  it's different. Here's from Big Sur  like they're little jewels. There are places in Africa where they do the mining of jewels  and you go to the sand where the rivers have the sand go down to the ocean  and it's like literally looking at tiny jewels through the microscope. So every grain of sand is unique. Every beach is different. Every single grain is different. There are no two grains of sand alike in the world. Every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere. They're like a snapshot in time. Now sand is not only on Earth  but sand is ubiquitous throughout the universe. In fact  outer space is filled with sand  and that sand comes together to make our planets and the Moon. And you can see those in micrometeorites. This is some micrometeorites that the Army gave me  and they get these out of the drinking wells in the South Pole. And they're quite amazing looking  and these are the tiny constituents that make up the world that we live in    the planets and the Moon. So NASA wanted me to take some pictures of Moon sand  so they sent me sand from all the different landings of the Apollo missions that happened    years ago. And I started taking pictures with my three dimensional microscopes. This was the first picture I took. It was kind of amazing. I thought it looked kind of a little bit like the Moon  which is sort of interesting. Now  the way my microscopes work is  normally in a microscope you can see very little at one time  so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope  keep taking pictures  and then I have a computer program that puts all those pictures together into one picture so you can see actually what it looks like  and I do that in  D. So there  you can see  is a left eye view. There's a right eye view. So sort of left eye view  right eye view. Now something's interesting here. This looks very different than any sand on Earth that I've ever seen  and I've seen a lot of sand on Earth  believe me.  Laughter  Look at this hole in the middle. That hole was caused by a micrometeorite hitting the Moon. Now  the Moon has no atmosphere  so micrometeorites come in continuously  and the whole surface of the Moon is covered with powder now  because for four billion years it's been bombarded by micrometeorites  and when micrometeorites come in at about    to        miles an hour  they vaporize on contact. And you can see here that that is    that's sort of vaporized  and that material is holding this little clump of little sand grains together. This is a very small grain of sand  this whole thing. And that's called a ring agglutinate. And many of the grains of sand on the Moon look like that  and you'd never find that on Earth. Most of the sand on the Moon  especially    and you know when you look at the Moon  there's the dark areas and the light areas. The dark areas are lava flows. They're basaltic lava flows  and that's what this sand looks like  very similar to the sand that you would see in Haleakala. Other sands  when these micrometeorites come in  they vaporize and they make these fountains  these microscopic fountains that go up into the    I was going to say  up into the air   but there is no air    goes sort of up  and these microscopic glass beads are formed instantly  and they harden  and by the time they fall down back to the surface of the Moon  they have these beautiful colored glass spherules. And these are actually microscopic  you need a microscope to see these. Now here's a grain of sand that is from the Moon  and you can see that the entire crystal structure is still there. This grain of sand is probably about three and a half or four billion years old  and it's never eroded away like the way we have sand on Earth erodes away because of water and tumbling  air  and so forth. All you can see is a little bit of erosion down here by the Sun  has these solar storms  and that's erosion by solar radiation. So what I've been trying to tell you today is things even as ordinary as a grain of sand can be truly extraordinary if you look closely and if you look from a different and a new point of view. I think that this was best put by William Blake when he said   To see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower  hold infinity in the palm of your hand  and eternity in an hour.  Thank you.  Applause  Across Europe and Central Asia  approximately one million children live in large residential institutions  usually known as orphanages. Most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment that care for children. Others know more about the living conditions there  but still think they're a necessary evil. After all  where else would we put all of those children who don't have any parents  But    years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development  and this is particularly true for young babies. As we know  babies are born without their full muscle development  and that includes the brain. During the first three years of life  the brain grows to its full size  with most of that growth taking place in the first six months. The brain develops in response to experience and to stimulation. Every time a young baby learns something new    to focus its eyes  to mimic a movement or a facial expression  to pick something up  to form a word or to sit up    new synaptic connections are being built in the brain. New parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning. They are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children's cleverness. They communicate their delight to their children  who respond with smiles  and a desire to achieve more and to learn more. This forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical  social  language  cognitive and psychomotor development. It is the model for all future relationships with friends  with partners and with their own children. It happens so naturally in most families that we don't even notice it. Most of us are unaware of its importance to human development and  by extension  to the development of a healthy society. And it's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children. In August        I had my first opportunity to witness on a massive scale the impact on children of institutionalization and the absence of parenting. Those of us who remember the newspaper reports that came out of Romania after the      revolution will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions. I was asked to help the director of a large institution to help prevent the separation of children from their families. Housing     babies  this was Ceausescu's show orphanage  and so I'd been told the conditions were much better. Having worked with lots of young children  I expected the institution to be a riot of noise  but it was as silent as a convent. It was hard to believe there were any children there at all  yet the director showed me into room after room  each containing row upon row of cots  in each of which lay a child staring into space. In a room of    newborns  not one of them was crying. Yet I could see soiled nappies  and I could see that some of the children were distressed  but the only noise was a low  continuous moan. The head nurse told me proudly   You see  our children are very well behaved.  Over the next few days  I began to realize that this quietness was not exceptional. The newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours  but their demands were not met  and so eventually they learned not to bother. Within a few days  they were listless  lethargic  and staring into space like all the others. Over the years  many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children  but often  one member of staff is caring for         and even    children. Hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program. The children must be woken at   and fed at     . At    their nappies must be changed  so a staff member may have only    minutes to feed    or    children. If a child soils its nappy at       he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again. The child's daily contact with another human being is reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing  and otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling  the walls or the bars of their cots. Since my first visit to Ceausescu's institution  I've seen hundreds of such places across    countries  from the Czech Republic to Sudan. Across all of these diverse lands and cultures  the institutions  and the child's journey through them  is depressingly similar. Lack of stimulation often leads to self stimulating behaviors like hand flapping  rocking back and forth  or aggression  and in some institutions  psychiatric drugs are used to control the behavior of these children  whilst in others  children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others. These children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities. Most of these children will never leave the institution again. For those without disabilities  at age three  they're transferred to another institution  and at age seven  to yet another. Segregated according to age and gender  they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings  often without even a chance to say goodbye. There's rarely enough to eat. They are often hungry. The older children bully the little ones. They learn to survive. They learn to defend themselves  or they go under. When they leave the institution  they find it really difficult to cope and to integrate into society. In Moldova  young women raised in institutions are    times more likely to be trafficked than their peers  and a Russian study found that two years after leaving institutions  young adults     percent of them had a criminal record     percent were involved in prostitution  and    percent had taken their own lives. But why are there so many orphans in Europe when there hasn't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years  In fact  more than    percent of these children have living parents  and societies tend to blame these parents for abandoning these children  but research shows that most parents want their children  and that the primary drivers behind institutionalization are poverty  disability and ethnicity. Many countries have not developed inclusive schools  and so even children with a very mild disability are sent away to a residential special school  at age six or seven. The institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home. If the family's poor  they find it difficult to visit  and gradually the relationship breaks down. Behind each of the million children in institutions  there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they've run out of options  like Natalia in Moldova  who only had enough money to feed her baby  and so had to send her older son to the institution  or Desi  in Bulgaria  who looked after her four children at home until her husband died  but then she had to go out to work full time  and with no support  felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution  or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents they're pregnant  who leave their babies in a hospital  or the new parents  the young couple who have just found out that their firstborn child has a disability  and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child's potential  are told by the doctors   Forget her  leave her in the institution  go home and make a healthy one.  This state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable. Every child has the right to a family  deserves and needs a family  and children are amazingly resilient. We find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on  they recover their developmental delays  and go on to lead normal  happy lives. It's also much cheaper to provide support to families than it is to provide institutions. One study suggests that a family support service costs    percent of an institutional placement  whilst good quality foster care costs usually about    percent. If we spend less on these children but on the right services  we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs. Across Europe  a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care to community based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential. When I first started to work in Romania nearly    years ago  there were         children living in institutions  and more entering every day. Now  there are less than         and family support services are provided across the country. In Moldova  despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects of the global financial crisis  the numbers of children in institutions has reduced by more than    percent in the last five years  and the resources are being redistributed to family support services and inclusive schools. Many countries have developed national action plans for change. The European Commission and other major donors are finding ways to divert money from institutions towards family support  empowering communities to look after their own children. But there is still much to be done to end the systematic institutionalization of children. Awareness raising is required at every level of society. People need to know the harm that institutions cause to children  and the better alternatives that exist. If we know people who are planning to support orphanages  we should convince them to support family services instead. Together  this is the one form of child abuse that we could eradicate in our lifetime. Thank you.  Applause  Let me tell you  it has been a fantastic month for deception. And I'm not even talking about the American presidential race.  Laughter  We have a high profile journalist caught for plagiarism  a young superstar writer whose book involves so many made up quotes that they've pulled it from the shelves  a New York Times expos  on fake book reviews. It's been fantastic. Now  of course  not all deception hits the news. Much of the deception is everyday. In fact  a lot of research shows that we all lie once or twice a day  as Dave suggested. So it's about      now  suggests that most of us should have lied. Let's take a look at Winnipeg. How many of you  in the last    hours    think back    have told a little fib  or a big one  How many have told a little lie out there  All right  good. These are all the liars. Make sure you pay attention to them.  Laughter  No  that looked good  it was about two thirds of you. The other third didn't lie  or perhaps forgot  or you're lying to me about your lying  which is very  very devious.  Laughter  This fits with a lot of the research  which suggests that lying is very pervasive. It's this pervasiveness  combined with the centrality to what it means to be a human  the fact that we can tell the truth or make something up  that has fascinated people throughout history. Here we have Diogenes with his lantern. Does anybody know what he was looking for  A single honest man  and he died without finding one back in Greece. And we have Confucius in the East who was really concerned with sincerity  not only that you walked the walk or talked the talk  but that you believed in what you were doing. You believed in your principles. Now my first professional encounter with deception is a little bit later than these guys  a couple thousand years. I was a customs officer for Canada back in the mid '  s. Yeah. I was defending Canada's borders. You may think that's a weapon right there. In fact  that's a stamp. I used a stamp to defend Canada's borders.  Laughter  Very Canadian of me. I learned a lot about deception while doing my duty here in customs  one of which was that most of what I thought I knew about deception was wrong  and I'll tell you about some of that tonight. But even since just       '    the way we communicate has been completely transformed. We email  we text  we skype  we Facebook. It's insane. Almost every aspect of human communication's been changed  and of course that's had an impact on deception. Let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions we've been tracking and documenting. They're called the Butler  the Sock Puppet and the Chinese Water Army. It sounds a little bit like a weird book  but actually they're all new types of lies. Let's start with the Butlers. Here's an example of one   On my way.  Anybody ever written   On my way   Then you've also lied.  Laughter  We're never on our way. We're thinking about going on our way. Here's another one   Sorry I didn't respond to you earlier. My battery was dead.  Your battery wasn't dead. You weren't in a dead zone. You just didn't want to respond to that person that time. Here's the last one  You're talking to somebody  and you say   Sorry  got work  gotta go.  But really  you're just bored. You want to talk to somebody else. Each of these is about a relationship  and this is a      connected world. Once you get my cell phone number  you can literally be in touch with me    hours a day. And so these lies are being used by people to create a buffer  like the butler used to do  between us and the connections to everybody else. But they're very special. They use ambiguity that comes from using technology. You don't know where I am or what I'm doing or who I'm with. And they're aimed at protecting the relationships. These aren't just people being jerks. These are people that are saying  look  I don't want to talk to you now  or I didn't want to talk to you then  but I still care about you. Our relationship is still important. Now  the Sock Puppet  on the other hand  is a totally different animal. The sock puppet isn't about ambiguity  per se. It's about identity. Let me give you a very recent example  as in  like  last week. Here's R.J. Ellory  best seller author in Britain. Here's one of his bestselling books. Here's a reviewer online  on Amazon. My favorite  by Nicodemus Jones  is   Whatever else it might do  it will touch your soul.  And of course  you might suspect that Nicodemus Jones is R.J. Ellory. He wrote very  very positive reviews about himself. Surprise  surprise. Now this Sock Puppet stuff isn't actually that new. Walt Whitman also did this back in the day  before there was Internet technology. Sock Puppet becomes interesting when we get to scale  which is the domain of the Chinese Water Army. Chinese Water Army refers to thousands of people in China that are paid small amounts of money to produce content. It could be reviews. It could be propaganda. The government hires these people  companies hire them  all over the place. In North America  we call this Astroturfing  and Astroturfing is very common now. There's a lot of concerns about it. We see this especially with product reviews  book reviews  everything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not. Now  looking at these three reviews  or these three types of deception  you might think  wow  the Internet is really making us a deceptive species  especially when you think about the Astroturfing  where we can see deception brought up to scale. But actually  what I've been finding is very different from that. Now  let's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms  which I'm sure none of you have been in. I can assure you there's deception there. And let's put aside the Nigerian prince who's emailed you about getting the    million out of the country.  Laughter  Let's forget about that guy  too. Let's focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones. Those are the conversations that really matter. What does technology do to deception with those folks  Here's a couple of studies. One of the studies we do are called diary studies  in which we ask people to record all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days  and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium  and the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media. And it really throws people for a loop because we think  well  there's no nonverbal cues  so why don't you lie more  The phone  in contrast  the most lies. Again and again and again we see the phone is the device that people lie on the most  and perhaps because of the Butler Lie ambiguities I was telling you about. This tends to be very different from what people expect. What about r sum s  We did a study in which we had people apply for a job  and they could apply for a job either with a traditional paper r sum   or on LinkedIn  which is a social networking site like Facebook  but for professionals    involves the same information as a r sum . And what we found  to many people's surprise  was that those LinkedIn r sum s were more honest on the things that mattered to employers  like your responsibilities or your skills at your previous job. How about Facebook itself  You know  we always think that hey  there are these idealized versions  people are just showing the best things that happened in their lives. I've thought that many times. My friends  no way they can be that cool and have good of a life. Well  one study tested this by examining people's personalities. They had four good friends of a person judge their personality. Then they had strangers  many strangers  judge the person's personality just from Facebook  and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical  highly correlated  meaning that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality. All right  well  what about online dating  I mean  that's a pretty deceptive space. I'm sure you all have  friends  that have used online dating.  Laughter  And they would tell you about that guy that had no hair when he came  or the woman that didn't look at all like her photo. Well  we were really interested in it  and so what we did is we brought people  online daters  into the lab  and then we measured them. We got their height up against the wall  we put them on a scale  got their weight    ladies loved that    and then we actually got their driver's license to get their age. And what we found was very  very interesting. Here's an example of the men and the height. Along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile. Along the y axis  the vertical axis  is how tall they actually were. That diagonal line is the truth line. If their dot's on it  they were telling exactly the truth. Now  as you see  most of the little dots are below the line. What it means is all the guys were lying about their height. In fact  they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch  what we say in the lab as  strong rounding up.   Laughter  You get to  '   and one tenth  and boom   '  . But what's really important here is  look at all those dots. They are clustering pretty close to the truth. What we found was    percent of our participants did indeed lie on one of those dimensions  but they always lied by a little bit. One of the reasons is pretty simple. If you go to a date  a coffee date  and you're completely different than what you said  game over. Right  So people lied frequently  but they lied subtly  not too much. They were constrained. Well  what explains all these studies  What explains the fact that despite our intuitions  mine included  a lot of online communication  technologically mediated communication  is more honest than face to face  That really is strange. How do we explain this  Well  to do that  one thing is we can look at the deception detection literature. It's a very old literature by now  it's coming up on    years. It's been reviewed many times. There's been thousands of trials  hundreds of studies  and there's some really compelling findings. The first is  we're really bad at detecting deception  really bad. Fifty four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not. That's really bad. Why is it so bad  Well it has to do with Pinocchio's nose. If I were to ask you guys  what do you rely on when you're looking at somebody and you want to find out if they're lying  What cue do you pay attention to  Most of you would say that one of the cues you look at is the eyes. The eyes are the window to the soul. And you're not alone. Around the world  almost every culture  one of the top cues is eyes. But the research over the last    years says there's actually no reliable cue to deception  which blew me away  and it's one of the hard lessons that I learned when I was customs officer. The eyes do not tell us whether somebody's lying or not. Some situations  yes    high stakes  maybe their pupils dilate  their pitch goes up  their body movements change a little bit  but not all the time  not for everybody  it's not reliable. Strange. The other thing is that just because you can't see me doesn't mean I'm going to lie. It's common sense  but one important finding is that we lie for a reason. We lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain or for somebody else's gain. So there are some pathological liars  but they make up a tiny portion of the population. We lie for a reason. Just because people can't see us doesn't mean we're going to necessarily lie. But I think there's actually something much more interesting and fundamental going on here. The next big thing for me  the next big idea  we can find by going way back in history to the origins of language. Most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere between        and         years ago. That's a long time ago. A lot of humans have lived since then. We've been talking  I guess  about fires and caves and saber toothed tigers. I don't know what they talked about  but they were doing a lot of talking  and like I said  there's a lot of humans evolving speaking  about     billion people in fact. What's important though is that writing only emerged about       years ago. So what that means is that all the people before there was any writing  every word that they ever said  every utterance disappeared. No trace. Evanescent. Gone. So we've been evolving to talk in a way in which there is no record. In fact  even the next big change to writing was only     years ago now  with the printing press  which is very recent in our past  and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until World War II  so even the people of the last two millennia  most of the words they ever said    poof     disappeared. Let's turn to now  the networked age. How many of you have recorded something today  Anybody do any writing today  Did anybody write a word  It looks like almost every single person here recorded something. In this room  right now  we've probably recorded more than almost all of human pre ancient history. That is crazy. We're entering this amazing period of flux in human evolution where we've evolved to speak in a way in which our words disappear  but we're in an environment where we're recording everything. In fact  I think in the very near future  it's not just what we write that will be recorded  everything we do will be recorded. What does that mean  What's the next big idea from that  Well  as a social scientist  this is the most amazing thing I have ever even dreamed of. Now  I can look at all those words that used to  for millennia  disappear. I can look at lies that before were said and then gone. You remember those Astroturfing reviews that we were talking about before  Well  when they write a fake review  they have to post it somewhere  and it's left behind for us. So one thing that we did  and I'll give you an example of looking at the language  is we paid people to write some fake reviews. One of these reviews is fake. The person never was at the James Hotel. The other review is real. The person stayed there. Now  your task now is to decide which review is fake  I'll give you a moment to read through them. But I want everybody to raise their hand at some point. Remember  I study deception. I can tell if you don't raise your hand. All right  how many of you believe that A is the fake  All right. Very good. About half. And how many of you think that B is  All right. Slightly more for B. Excellent. Here's the answer. B is a fake. Well done second group. You dominated the first group.  Laughter  You're actually a little bit unusual. Every time we demonstrate this  it's usually about a       split  which fits with the research     percent. Maybe people here in Winnipeg are more suspicious and better at figuring it out. Those cold  hard winters  I love it. All right  so why do I care about this  Well  what I can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception. Let me highlight a couple of things here in the fake review. The first is that liars tend to think about narrative. They make up a story  Who  And what happened  And that's what happened here. Our fake reviewers talked about who they were with and what they were doing. They also used the first person singular  I  way more than the people that actually stayed there. They were inserting themselves into the hotel review  kind of trying to convince you they were there. In contrast  the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there  their bodies actually entered the physical space  they talked a lot more about spatial information. They said how big the bathroom was  or they said  you know  here's how far shopping is from the hotel. Now  you guys did pretty well. Most people perform at chance at this task. Our computer algorithm is very accurate  much more accurate than humans can be  and it's not going to be accurate all the time. This isn't a deception detection machine to tell if your girlfriend's lying to you on text messaging. We believe that every lie now  every type of lie    fake hotel reviews  fake shoe reviews  your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging    those are all different lies. They're going to have different patterns of language. But because everything's recorded now  we can look at all of those kinds of lies. Now  as I said  as a social scientist  this is wonderful. It's transformational. We're going to be able to learn so much more about human thought and expression  about everything from love to attitudes  because everything is being recorded now  but what does it mean for the average citizen  What does it mean for us in our lives  Well  let's forget deception for a bit. One of the big ideas  I believe  is that we're leaving these huge traces behind. My outbox for email is massive  and I never look at it. I write all the time  but I never look at my record  at my trace. And I think we're going to see a lot more of that  where we can reflect on who we are by looking at what we wrote  what we said  what we did. Now  if we bring it back to deception  there's a couple of take away things here. First  lying online can be very dangerous  right  Not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine  but you're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to  and you're also leaving them around for me to analyze with some computer algorithms. So by all means  go ahead and do that  that's good. But when it comes to lying and what we want to do with our lives  I think we can go back to Diogenes and Confucius. And they were less concerned about whether to lie or not to lie  and more concerned about being true to the self  and I think this is really important. Now  when you are about to say or do something  we can think  do I want this to be part of my legacy  part of my personal record  Because in the digital age we live in now  in the networked age  we are all leaving a record. Thank you so much for your time  and good luck with your record.  Applause  On my desk in my office  I keep a small clay pot that I made in college. It's raku  which is a kind of pottery that began in Japan centuries ago as a way of making bowls for the Japanese tea ceremony. This one is more than     years old. Each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay  and it was the imperfections that people cherished. Everyday pots like this cup take eight to    hours to fire. I just took this out of the kiln last week  and the kiln itself takes another day or two to cool down  but raku is really fast. You do it outside  and you take the kiln up to temperature. In    minutes  it goes to       degrees  and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside  you can see that faint sheen  you turn the kiln off  and you reach in with these long metal tongs  you grab the pot  and in Japan  this red hot pot would be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea  and you can imagine what that steam would smell like. But here in the United States  we ramp up the drama a little bit  and we drop our pots into sawdust  which catches on fire  and you take a garbage pail  and you put it on top  and smoke starts pouring out. I would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke. I love raku because it allows me to play with the elements. I can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze  but then I have to let it go to the fire and the smoke  and what's wonderful is the surprises that happen  like this crackle pattern  because it's really stressful on these pots. They go from       degrees to room temperature in the space of just a minute. Raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity. I find in so many things that tension between what I can control and what I have to let go happens all the time  whether I'm creating a new radio show or just at home negotiating with my teenage sons. When I sat down to write a book about creativity  I realized that the steps were reversed. I had to let go at the very beginning  and I had to immerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artists and writers and musicians and filmmakers  and as I listened to these stories  I realized that creativity grows out of everyday experiences more often than you might think  including letting go. It was supposed to break  but that's okay.  Laughter   Laughs  That's part of the letting go  is sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't  because creativity also grows from the broken places. The best way to learn about anything is through stories  and so I want to tell you a story about work and play and about four aspects of life that we need to embrace in order for our own creativity to flourish. The first embrace is something that we think   Oh  this is very easy   but it's actually getting harder  and that's paying attention to the world around us. So many artists speak about needing to be open  to embrace experience  and that's hard to do when you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket that takes all of your focus. The filmmaker Mira Nair speaks about growing up in a small town in India. Its name is Bhubaneswar  and here's a picture of one of the temples in her town. Mira Nair  In this little town  there were like       temples. We played cricket all the time. We kind of grew up in the rubble. The major thing that inspired me  that led me on this path  that made me a filmmaker eventually  was traveling folk theater that would come through the town and I would go off and see these great battles of good and evil by two people in a school field with no props but with a lot of  you know  passion  and hashish as well  and it was amazing. You know  the folk tales of Mahabharata and Ramayana  the two holy books  the epics that everything comes out of in India  they say. After seeing that Jatra  the folk theater  I knew I wanted to get on  you know  and perform. Julie Burstein  Isn't that a wonderful story  You can see the sort of break in the everyday. There they are in the school fields  but it's good and evil  and passion and hashish. And Mira Nair was a young girl with thousands of other people watching this performance  but she was ready. She was ready to open up to what it sparked in her  and it led her  as she said  down this path to become an award winning filmmaker. So being open for that experience that might change you is the first thing we need to embrace. Artists also speak about how some of their most powerful work comes out of the parts of life that are most difficult. The novelist Richard Ford speaks about a childhood challenge that continues to be something he wrestles with today. He's severely dyslexic. Richard Ford  I was slow to learn to read  went all the way through school not really reading more than the minimum  and still to this day can't read silently much faster than I can read aloud  but there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for me because when I finally did reconcile myself to how slow I was going to have to do it  then I think I came very slowly into an appreciation of all of those qualities of language and of sentences that are not just the cognitive aspects of language  the syncopations  the sounds of words  what words look like  where paragraphs break  where lines break. I mean  I wasn't so badly dyslexic that I was disabled from reading. I just had to do it really slowly  and as I did  lingering on those sentences as I had to linger  I fell heir to language's other qualities  which I think has helped me write sentences. JB  It's so powerful. Richard Ford  who's won the Pulitzer Prize  says that dyslexia helped him write sentences. He had to embrace this challenge  and I use that word intentionally. He didn't have to overcome dyslexia. He had to learn from it. He had to learn to hear the music in language. Artists also speak about how pushing up against the limits of what they can do  sometimes pushing into what they can't do  helps them focus on finding their own voice. The sculptor Richard Serra talks about how  as a young artist  he thought he was a painter  and he lived in Florence after graduate school. While he was there  he traveled to Madrid  where he went to the Prado to see this picture by the Spanish painter Diego Vel zquez. It's from       and it's called  Las Meninas   and it's the picture of a little princess and her ladies in waiting  and if you look over that little blonde princess's shoulder  you'll see a mirror  and reflected in it are her parents  the King and Queen of Spain  who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture. As he often did  Vel zquez put himself in this painting too. He's standing on the left with his paintbrush in one hand and his palette in the other. Richard Serra  I was standing there looking at it  and I realized that Vel zquez was looking at me  and I thought   Oh. I'm the subject of the painting.  And I thought   I'm not going to be able to do that painting.  I was to the point where I was using a stopwatch and painting squares out of randomness  and I wasn't getting anywhere. So I went back and dumped all my paintings in the Arno  and I thought  I'm going to just start playing around. JB  Richard Serra says that so nonchalantly  you might have missed it. He went and saw this painting by a guy who'd been dead for     years  and realized   I can't do that   and so Richard Serra went back to his studio in Florence  picked up all of his work up to that point  and threw it in a river. Richard Serra let go of painting at that moment  but he didn't let go of art. He moved to New York City  and he put together a list of verbs   to roll  to crease  to fold   more than a hundred of them  and as he said  he just started playing around. He did these things to all kinds of material. He would take a huge sheet of lead and roll it up and unroll it. He would do the same thing to rubber  and when he got to the direction  to lift   he created this  which is in the Museum of Modern Art. Richard Serra had to let go of painting in order to embark on this playful exploration that led him to the work that he's known for today  huge curves of steel that require our time and motion to experience. In sculpture  Richard Serra is able to do what he couldn't do in painting. He makes us the subject of his art. So experience and challenge and limitations are all things we need to embrace for creativity to flourish. There's a fourth embrace  and it's the hardest. It's the embrace of loss  the oldest and most constant of human experiences. In order to create  we have to stand in that space between what we see in the world and what we hope for  looking squarely at rejection  at heartbreak  at war  at death. That's a tough space to stand in. The educator Parker Palmer calls it  the tragic gap   tragic not because it's sad but because it's inevitable  and my friend Dick Nodel likes to say   You can hold that tension like a violin string and make something beautiful.  That tension resonates in the work of the photographer Joel Meyerowitz  who at the beginning of his career was known for his street photography  for capturing a moment on the street  and also for his beautiful photographs of landscapes    of Tuscany  of Cape Cod  of light. Joel is a New Yorker  and his studio for many years was in Chelsea  with a straight view downtown to the World Trade Center  and he photographed those buildings in every sort of light. You know where this story goes. On       Joel wasn't in New York. He was out of town  but he raced back to the city  and raced down to the site of the destruction. Joel Meyerowitz  And like all the other passersby  I stood outside the chain link fence on Chambers and Greenwich  and all I could see was the smoke and a little bit of rubble  and I raised my camera to take a peek  just to see if there was something to see  and some cop  a lady cop  hit me on my shoulder  and said   Hey  no pictures   And it was such a blow that it woke me up  in the way that it was meant to be  I guess. And when I asked her why no pictures  she said   It's a crime scene. No photographs allowed.  And I asked her   What would happen if I was a member of the press   And she told me   Oh  look back there   and back a block was the press corps tied up in a little penned in area  and I said   Well  when do they go in   and she said   Probably never.  And as I walked away from that  I had this crystallization  probably from the blow  because it was an insult in a way. I thought   Oh  if there's no pictures  then there'll be no record. We need a record.  And I thought   I'm gonna make that record. I'll find a way to get in  because I don't want to see this history disappear.  JB  He did. He pulled in every favor he could  and got a pass into the World Trade Center site  where he photographed for nine months almost every day. Looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when I went home to my family at night. My office was just a few blocks away. But some of these photographs are beautiful  and we wondered  was it difficult for Joel Meyerowitz to make such beauty out of such devastation  JM  Well  you know  ugly  I mean  powerful and tragic and horrific and everything  but it was also as  in nature  an enormous event that was transformed after the fact into this residue  and like many other ruins   you go to the ruins of the Colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace   and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather. I mean  there were afternoons I was down there  and the light goes pink and there's a mist in the air and you're standing in the rubble  and I found myself recognizing both the inherent beauty of nature and the fact that nature  as time  is erasing this wound. Time is unstoppable  and it transforms the event. It gets further and further away from the day  and light and seasons temper it in some way  and it's not that I'm a romantic. I'm really a realist. The reality is  there's the Woolworth Building in a veil of smoke from the site  but it's now like a scrim across a theater  and it's turning pink  you know  and down below there are hoses spraying  and the lights have come on for the evening  and the water is turning acid green because the sodium lamps are on  and I'm thinking   My God  who could dream this up   But the fact is  I'm there  it looks like that  you have to take a picture. JB  You have to take a picture. That sense of urgency  of the need to get to work  is so powerful in Joel's story. When I saw Joel Meyerowitz recently  I told him how much I admired his passionate obstinacy  his determination to push through all the bureaucratic red tape to get to work  and he laughed  and he said   I'm stubborn  but I think what's more important is my passionate optimism.  The first time I told these stories  a man in the audience raised his hand and said   All these artists talk about their work  not their art  which has got me thinking about my work and where the creativity is there  and I'm not an artist.  He's right. We all wrestle with experience and challenge  limits and loss. Creativity is essential to all of us  whether we're scientists or teachers  parents or entrepreneurs. I want to leave you with another image of a Japanese tea bowl. This one is at the Freer Gallery in Washington  D.C. It's more than a hundred years old and you can still see the fingermarks where the potter pinched it. But as you can also see  this one did break at some point in its hundred years. But the person who put it back together  instead of hiding the cracks  decided to emphasize them  using gold lacquer to repair it. This bowl is more beautiful now  having been broken  than it was when it was first made  and we can look at those cracks  because they tell the story that we all live  of the cycle of creation and destruction  of control and letting go  of picking up the pieces and making something new. Thank you.  Applause  So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife. It makes me to stand here  the fame  the money I got out of it. So what I did  I'd gone back to my early marriage days. What you did in the early marriage days  you tried to impress your wife. I did the same. On that occasion  I found my wife carrying something like this. I saw.  What is that   I asked. My wife replied   None of your business.  Then  being her husband  I ran behind her and saw she had a nasty rag cloth. I don't even use that cloth to clean my two wheeler. Then I understood this    adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days. Then I immediately asked her  why are you  using  that unhygienic method  She replied  I also know about  sanitary pads   but myself and my sisters  if they start using that  we have to cut our family milk budget. Then I was shocked. What is the connection between using a sanitary pad and a milk budget  And it's called affordability. I tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads. I went to a local shop  I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet. That fellow looks left and right  and spreads a newspaper  rolls it into the newspaper  gives it to me like a banned item  something like that. I don't know why. I did not ask for a condom. Then I took that pad. I want to see that. What is inside it  The very first time  at the age of     that day I am touching the sanitary pad  first ever. I must know  How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad  They are not going to touch that  because it's not your matter. Then I thought to myself  white substance  made of cotton    oh my God  that guy is just using a penny value of raw material    inside they are selling for pounds  dollars. Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife  That's how all this started  but after making a sanitary pad  where can I check it  It's not like I can just check it in the lab. I need a woman volunteer. Where can I get one in India  Even in Bangalore you won't get  one   in India. So only problem  the only available victim is my wife. Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti    my wife's name is Shanti.  Close your eyes. Whatever I give  it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond ring  even a chocolate  I will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it. Close your eyes.  Because I tried to make it intimate. Because it's an arranged marriage  not a love marriage. So one day she said  openly  I'm not going to support this research. Then other victims  they got into my sisters. But even sisters  wives  they're not ready to support in the research. That's why I am always jealous with the saints in India. They are having a lot of women volunteers around them. Why I am not getting  any   You know  without them even calling  they'll get a lot of women volunteers. Then I used  tried to use the medical college girls. They also refused. Finally  I decide  use sanitary pad myself. Now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon. Armstrong. Then Tenzing  and  Hillary  in Everest  like that Muruganantham is the first man wore a sanitary pad across the globe. I wore a sanitary pad. I filled animal blood in a football bottle  I tied it up here  there is a tube going into my panties  while I'm walking  while I'm cycling  I made a press  doses of blood will go there. That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect. That five days I'll never forget    the messy days  the lousy days  that wetness. My God  it's unbelievable. But here the problem is  one company is making napkin out of cotton. It is working well. But I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton. It's not working. That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research. You need first funds. Not only financial crises  but because of the sanitary pad research  I come through all sorts of problems  including a divorce notice from my wife. Why is this  I used medical college girls. She suspects I am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls. Finally  I came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood  but even after that  you need a multimillion dollar plant like this to process that material. Again  a stop up. Then I spend another four years to create my own machine tools  a simple machine tool like this. In this machine  any rural woman can apply the same raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant  anyone can make a world class napkin at your dining hall. That is my invention. So after that  what I did  usually if anyone got a patent or an invention  immediately you want to make  convert into this. I never did this. I dropped it just like this  because you do this  if anyone runs after money  their life will not  have  any beauty. It is boredom. A lot of people making a lot of money  billion  billions of dollars accumulating. Why are they coming for  finally  for philanthropy  Why the need for accumulating money  then doing philanthropy  What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one  That's why I am giving this machine only in rural India  for rural women  because in India   you'll be  surprised  only two percent of women are using sanitary pads. The rest  they're using a rag cloth  a leaf  husk   saw  dust  everything except sanitary pads. It is the same in the   st century. That's why I am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India. So far      installations happened in    states in six other countries. Now I'm on my seventh year sustaining against multinational  transnational giants    makes all MBA students a question mark. A school dropout from Coimbatore  how he is able to sustaining  That makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs. Play video one. She replied immediately   I know about napkins  but if I start using napkins  then we have to cut our family milk budget.  Why not make myself a low cost napkin  So I decided I'm going to sell this new machine only for Women Self Help Groups. That is my idea. AM  And previously  you need a multimillion investment for machine and all. Now  any rural woman can. They are performing puja. You just think  competing giants  even from Harvard  Oxford  is difficult. I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals. I'm sustaining on seventh year. Already     installations. What is my mission  I'm going to make India  into  a     percent sanitary napkin using country in my lifetime. In this way I'm going to provide not less than a million rural employment that I'm going to create. That's why I'm not running after this bloody money. I'm doing something serious. If you chase a girl  the girl won't like you. Do your job simply  the girl will chase you. Like that  I never chased Mahalakshmi. Mahalakshmi is chasing me  I am keeping in the back pocket. Not in front pocket. I'm a back pocket man. That's all. A school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad. I am becoming a solution provider. I'm very happy. I don't want to make this as a corporate entity. I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe. That's why I put all the details on public domain like an open software. Now     countries are accessing it. Okay  So I classify the people into three  uneducated  little educated  surplus educated. Little educated  done this. Surplus educated  what are you going to do for the society  Thank you very much. Bye  I was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the P.O. box at the end of the day  and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email  in Facebook  in texting or cell phones in general. And so while other kids were BBM ing their parents  I was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone  which was a little frustrating when Grandma was in the hospital  but I was just looking for some sort of scribble  some unkempt cursive from my mother. And so when I moved to New York City after college and got completely sucker punched in the face by depression  I did the only thing I could think of at the time. I wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me for strangers  and tucked them all throughout the city  dozens and dozens of them. I left them everywhere  in cafes and in libraries  at the U.N.  everywhere. I blogged about those letters and the days when they were necessary  and I posed a kind of crazy promise to the Internet  that if you asked me for a hand written letter  I would write you one  no questions asked. Overnight  my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak    a single mother in Sacramento  a girl being bullied in rural Kansas  all asking me  a    year old girl who barely even knew her own coffee order  to write them a love letter and give them a reason to wait by the mailbox. Well  today I fuel a global organization that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox  fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media like never before to write and mail strangers letters when they need them most  but most of all  fueled by crates of mail like this one  my trusty mail crate  filled with the scriptings of ordinary people  strangers writing letters to other strangers not because they're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee  but because they have found one another by way of letter writing. But  you know  the thing that always gets me about these letters is that most of them have been written by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper. They could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters. They're the ones from my generation  the ones of us that have grown up into a world where everything is paperless  and where some of our best conversations have happened upon a screen. We have learned to diary our pain onto Facebook  and we speak swiftly in     characters or less. But what if it's not about efficiency this time  I was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate  which is a conversation starter  let me tell you. If you ever need one  just carry one of these.  Laughter  And a man just stared at me  and he was like   Well  why don't you use the Internet   And I thought   Well  sir  I am not a strategist  nor am I specialist. I am merely a storyteller.  And so I could tell you about a woman whose husband has just come home from Afghanistan  and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation  and so she tucks love letters throughout the house as a way to say   Come back to me. Find me when you can.  Or a girl who decides that she is going to leave love letters around her campus in Dubuque  Iowa  only to find her efforts ripple effected the next day when she walks out onto the quad and finds love letters hanging from the trees  tucked in the bushes and the benches. Or the man who decides that he is going to take his life  uses Facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family. Well  tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tucked beneath his pillow  scripted by strangers who were there for him when. These are the kinds of stories that convinced me that letter writing will never again need to flip back her hair and talk about efficiency  because she is an art form now  all the parts of her  the signing  the scripting  the mailing  the doodles in the margins. The mere fact that somebody would even just sit down  pull out a piece of paper and think about someone the whole way through  with an intention that is so much harder to unearth when the browser is up and the iPhone is pinging and we've got six conversations rolling in at once  that is an art form that does not fall down to the Goliath of  get faster   no matter how many social networks we might join. We still clutch close these letters to our chest  to the words that speak louder than loud  when we turn pages into palettes to say the things that we have needed to say  the words that we have needed to write  to sisters and brothers and even to strangers  for far too long. Thank you.  Applause  Today  I'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics. I'm  among several other things  an electrical engineer  and that means that I spend a good amount of time designing and building new pieces of technology  and more specifically designing and building electronics. And what I've found is that the process of designing and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways. So it's a really slow process  it's really expensive  and the outcome of that process  namely electronic circuit boards  are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways. So they're really small  generally  they're square and flat and hard  and frankly  most of them just aren't very attractive  and so my team and I have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the outcome of designing electronics. And so what if you could design and build electronics like this  So what if you could do it extremely quickly  extremely inexpensively  and maybe more interestingly  really fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally  Wouldn't that be so cool  and that wouldn't that open up all sorts of new possibilities  I'm going to share with you two projects that are investigations along these lines  and we'll start with this one. A conductive pen from the Lewis lab at UIUC. Sticker templates. Speed x  . Making a switch. Music  DJ Shadow. Adding some intelligence with a microcontroller. Sketching an interface. Pretty cool  huh  We think so. So now that we developed these tools and found these materials that let us do these things  we started to realize that  essentially  anything that we can do with paper  anything that we can do with a piece of paper and a pen we can now do with electronics. So the next project that I want to show you is kind of a deeper exploration of that possibility. And I'll kind of let it speak for itself. So the next step for us in this process is now to find a way to let all of you build things like this  and so the way that we're approaching that is by teaching workshops to people where we explain how they can use these kinds of tools  and then also working to get the tools and the materials and techniques out into the real world in a variety of ways. And so sometime soon  you'll be able to play and build and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way. So thank you very much.  Applause  Sydney. I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney. I got to the airport  to the hotel  checked in  and  sitting there in the lobby  was a brochure for the Sydney Festival. I thumbed through it  and I came across a show called  Minto  Live.  The description read   The suburban streets of Minto become the stage for performances created by international artists in collaboration with the people of Minto.  What was this place called Minto  Sydney  as I would learn  is a city of suburbs  and Minto lies southwest  about an hour away. I have to say  it wasn't exactly what I had in mind for my first day down under. I mean  I'd thought about the Harbour Bridge or Bondi Beach  but Minto  But still  I'm a producer  and the lure of a site specific theater project was more than I could resist.  Laughter  So  off I went into Friday afternoon traffic  and I'll never forget what I saw when I got there. For the performance  the audience walked around the neighborhood from house to house  and the residents  who were the performers  they came out of their houses  and they performed these autobiographical dances on their lawns  on their driveways.  Laughter  The show is a collaboration with a U.K. based performance company called Lone Twin. Lone Twin had come to Minto and worked with the residents  and they had created these dances. This Australian Indian girl  she came out and started to dance on her front lawn  and her father peered out the window to see what all the noise and commotion was about  and he soon joined her. And he was followed by her little sister. And soon they were all dancing this joyous  exuberant dance right there on their lawn.  Laughter  And as I walked through the neighborhood  I was amazed and I was moved by the incredible sense of ownership this community clearly felt about this event.  Minto  Live  brought Sydneysiders into dialogue with international artists  and really celebrated the diversity of Sydney on its own terms. The Sydney Festival which produced  Minto  Live  I think represents a new kind of   st century arts festival. These festivals are radically open. They can transform cities and communities. To understand this  I think it kind of makes sense to look where we've come from. Modern arts festivals were born in the rubble of World War II. Civic leaders created these annual events to celebrate culture as the highest expression of the human spirit. In       the Edinburgh Festival was born and Avignon was born and hundreds of others would follow in their wake. The work they did was very  very high art  and stars came along like Laurie Anderson and Merce Cunningham and Robert Lepage who made work for this circuit  and you had these seminal shows like  The Mahabharata  and the monumental  Einstein on the Beach.  But as the decades passed  these festivals  they really became the establishment  and as the culture and capital accelerated  the Internet brought us all together  high and low kind of disappeared  a new kind of festival emerged. The old festivals  they continued to thrive  but from Brighton to Rio to Perth  something new was emerging  and these festivals were really different. They're open  these festivals  because  like in Minto  they understand that the dialogue between the local and the global is essential. They're open because they ask the audience to be a player  a protagonist  a partner  rather than a passive spectator  and they're open because they know that imagination cannot be contained in buildings  and so much of the work they do is site specific or outdoor work. So  the new festival  it asks the audience to play an essential role in shaping the performance. Companies like De La Guarda  which I produce  and Punchdrunk create these completely immersive experiences that put the audience at the center of the action  but the German performance company Rimini Protokoll takes this all to a whole new level. In a series of shows that includes      Percent Vancouver        Percent Berlin   Rimini Protokoll makes shows that actually reflect society. Rimini Protokoll chooses     people that represent that city at that moment in terms of race and gender and class  through a careful process that begins three months before  and then those     people share stories about themselves and their lives  and the whole thing becomes a snapshot of that city at that moment. LIFT has always been a pioneer in the use of venues. They understand that theater and performance can happen anywhere. You can do a show in a schoolroom  in an airport     Laughter    in a department store window. Artists are explorers. Who better to show us the city anew  Artists can take us to a far flung part of the city that we haven't explored  or they can take us into that building that we pass every day but we never went into. An artist  I think  can really show us people that we might overlook in our lives. Back to Back is an Australian company of people with intellectual disabilities. I saw their amazing show in New York at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal at rush hour. We  the audience  were given headsets and seated on one side of the terminal. The actors were right there in front of us  right there among the commuters  and we could hear them  but we might not have otherwise seen them. So Back to Back takes site specific theater and uses it to gently remind us about who and what we choose to edit out of our daily lives. So  the dialogue with the local and the global  the audience as participant and player and protagonist  the innovative use of site  all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fantastic French company Royal de Luxe. Royal de Luxe's giant puppets come into a city and they live there for a few days. For  The Sultan's Elephant   Royal de Luxe came to central London and brought it to a standstill with their story of a giant little girl and her friend  a time traveling elephant. For a few days  they transformed a massive city into a community where endless possibility reigned. The Guardian wrote   If art is about transformation  then there can be no more transformative experience. What 'The Sultan's Elephant' represents is no less than an artistic occupation of the city and a reclamation of the streets for the people.  We can talk about the economic impacts of these festivals on their cities  but I'm much  more  interested in many more things  like how a festival helps a city to express itself  how it lets it come into its own. Festivals promote diversity  they bring neighbors into dialogue  they increase creativity  they offer opportunities for civic pride  they improve our general psychological well being. In short  they make cities better places to live. Case in point  When  The Sultan's Elephant  came to London just nine months after      a Londoner wrote   For the first time since the London bombings  my daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice. She had gathered with others to watch 'The Sultan's Elephant ' and  you know  it just made all the difference.  Lyn Gardner in The Guardian has written that a great festival can show us a map of the world  a map of the city and a map of ourselves  but there is no one fixed festival model. I think what's so brilliant about the festivals  the new festivals  is that they are really fully capturing the complexity and the excitement of the way we all live today. Thank you very much.  Applause  I'm a brain scientist  and as a brain scientist  I'm actually interested in how the brain learns  and I'm especially interested in a possibility of making our brains smarter  better and faster. This is in this context I'm going to tell you about video games. When we say video games  most of you think about children. It's true. Ninety percent of children do play video games. But let's be frank. When the kids are in bed  who is in front of the PlayStation  Most of you. The average age of a gamer is    years old  not eight years old  and in fact  if we look at the projected demographics of video game play  the video game players of tomorrow are older adults.  Laughter  So video  gaming  is pervasive throughout our society. It is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impact on our everyday life. Consider these statistics released by Activision. After one month of release of the game  Call Of Duty  Black Ops   it had been played for        years worldwide  right  Would any of you complain if this was the case about doing linear algebra  So what we are asking in the lab is  how can we leverage that power  Now I want to step back a bit. I know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games. after your enemy zombie bad guys before they get to you  right  And I'm almost sure most of you have thought   Oh  come on  can't you do something more intelligent than shooting at zombies   I'd like you to put this kind of knee jerk reaction in the context of what you would have thought if you had found your girl playing sudoku or your boy reading Shakespeare. Right  Most parents would find that great. Well  I'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health. It's not  and binging is never good. But I'm going to argue that in reasonable doses  actually the very game I showed you at the beginning  those action packed shooter games have quite powerful effects and positive effects on many different aspects of our behavior. There's not one week that goes without some major headlines in the media about whether video games are good or bad for you  right  You're all bombarded with that. I'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab. What we do in the lab is actually measure directly  in a quantitative fashion  what is the impact of video games on the brain. And so I'm going to take a few examples from our work. One first saying that I'm sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse. That's a statement about vision. There may be vision scientists among you. We actually know how to test that statement. We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is. Well  guess what  People that don't play a lot of action games  that don't actually spend a lot of time in front of screens  have normal  or what we call corrective to normal vision. That's okay. The issue is what happens with these guys that actually indulge into playing video games like five hours per week     hours per week     hours per week. By that statement  their vision should be really bad  right  Guess what  Their vision is really  really good. It's better than those that don't play. And it's better in two different ways. The first way is that they're actually able to resolve small detail in the context of clutter  and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription rather than using magnifier glasses  you can actually do it with just your eyesight. The other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve different levels of gray. Imagine you're driving in a fog. That makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avoiding the accident  or getting into an accident. So we're actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision  and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better. Clearly  when it comes to action video games  screen time doesn't make your eyesight worse. Another saying that I'm sure you have all heard around  Video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability. Okay  we know how to measure attention in the lab. I'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so. I'm going to ask you to participate  so you're going to have to actually play the game with me. I'm going to show you colored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink. Right  So this is the first example.   Chair   Orange  good.   Table   Green.   Board   Audience  Red.Daphne Bavelier  Red.   Horse   DB  Yellow. Audience  Yellow.   Yellow   DB  Red. Audience  Yellow.   Blue   DB  Yellow. Okay  you get my point  right   Laughter  You're getting better  but it's hard. Why is it hard  Because I introduced a conflict between the word itself and its color. How good your attention is determines actually how fast you resolve that conflict  so the young guys here at the top of their game probably  like  did a little better than some of us that are older. What we can show is that when you do this kind of task with people that play a lot of action games  they actually resolve the conflict faster. So clearly playing those action games doesn't lead to attention problems. Actually  those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention  and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world. This is something we use all the time. When you're driving  you're tracking  keeping track of the cars around you. You're also keeping track of the pedestrian  the running dog  and that's how you can actually be safe driving  right  In the lab  we get people to come to the lab  sit in front of a computer screen  and we give them little tasks that I'm going to get you to do again. You're going to see yellow happy faces and a few sad blue faces. These are children in the schoolyard in Geneva during a recess during the winter. Most kids are happy. It's actually recess. But a few kids are sad and blue because they've forgotten their coat. Everybody begins to move around  and your task is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning and who didn't. So I'm just going to show you an example where there is only one sad kid. It's easy because you can actually track it with your eyes. You can track  you can track  and then when it stops  and there is a question mark  and I ask you  did this kid have a coat or not  Was it yellow initially or blue  I hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain.  Laughter  I'm now going to ask you to do the task  but now with a little more challenging task. There are going to be three of them that are blue. Don't move your eyes. Please don't move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixated and expand  pull your attention. That's the only way you can actually do it. If you move your eyes  you're doomed. Yellow or blue  Audience  Yellow.DB  Good. So your typical normal young adult can have a span of about three or four objects of attention. That's what we just did. Your action video game player has a span of about six to seven objects of attention  which is what is shown in this video here. That's for you guys  action video game players. A bit more challenging  right   Laughter  Yellow or blue  Blue. We have some people that are serious out there. Yeah.  Laughter  Good. So in the same way that we actually see the effects of video games on people's behavior  we can use brain imaging and look at the impact of video games on the brain  and we do find many changes  but the main changes are actually to the brain networks that control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex which is very well known to control the orientation of attention. The other one is the frontal lobe  which controls how we sustain attention  and another one is the anterior cingulate  which controls how we allocate and regulate attention and resolve conflict. Now  when we do brain imaging  we find that all three of these networks are actually much more efficient in people that play action games. This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding in the literature about technology and the brain. You all know about multitasking. You all have been faulty of multitasking when you're driving and you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea. Why  Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone  you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you  and so you're much more likely to get engaged into a car accident. Now  we can measure that kind of skills in the lab. We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have. That would be a little costly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer where we can measure  to millisecond accuracy  how good they are at switching from one task to another. When we do that  we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really  really good. They switch really fast  very swiftly. They pay a very small cost. Now I'd like you to remember that result  and put it in the context of another group of technology users  a group which is actually much revered by society  which are people that engage in multimedia tasking. What is multimedia tasking  It's the fact that most of us  most of our children  are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they're doing search on the web at the same time as they're chatting on Facebook with their friends. That's a multimedia tasker. There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford and that we replicated that showed that those people that identify as being high multimedia taskers are absolutely abysmal at multitasking. When we measure them in the lab  they're really bad. Right  So these kinds of results really makes two main points. The first one is that not all media are created equal. You can't compare the effect of multimedia tasking and the effect of playing action games. They have totally different effects on different aspects of cognition  perception and attention. Even within video games  I'm telling you right now about these action packed video games. Different video games have a different effect on your brains. So we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video game. The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight. I showed that to you already  like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time  those action gamers have a lot of very good vision  etc. Here  what was really striking is that these undergraduates that actually report engaging in a lot of high multimedia tasking are convinced they aced the test. So you show them their data  you show them they are bad and they're like   Not possible.  You know  they have this sort of gut feeling that  really  they are doing really  really good. That's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain. Now in a sense  when we think about the effect of video games on the brain  it's very similar to the effect of wine on the health. There are some very poor uses of wine. There are some very poor uses of video games. But when consumed in reasonable doses  and at the right age  wine can be very good for health. There are actually specific molecules that have been identified in red wine as leading to greater life expectancy. So it's the same way  like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity  learning  attention  vision  etc.  and so we need and we're working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them to deliver better games  either for education or for rehabilitation of patients. Now because we are interested in having an impact for education or rehabilitation of patients  we are actually not that interested in how those of you that choose to play video games for many hours on end perform. I'm much more interested in taking any of you and showing that by forcing you to play an action game  I can actually change your vision for the better  whether you want to play that action game or not  right  That's the point of rehabilitation or education. Most of the kids don't go to school saying   Great  two hours of math   So that's really the crux of the research  and to do that  we need to go one more step. And one more step is to do training studies. So let me illustrate that step with a task which is called mental rotation. Mental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you  and again you're going to do the task  to look at this shape. Study it  it's a target shape  and I'm going to present to you four different shapes. One of these four different shapes is actually a rotated version of this shape. I want you to tell me which one  the first one  second one  third one or fourth one  Okay  I'll help you. Fourth one. One more. Get those brains working. Come on. That's our target shape. Third. Good  This is hard  right  Like  the reason that I asked you to do that is because you really feel your brain cringing  right  It doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games. Well  what we do in these training studies is  people come to the lab  they do tasks like this one  we then force them to play    hours of action games. They don't play    hours of action games in a row. They do distributed practice  so little shots of    minutes several days over a period of two weeks. Then  once they are done with the training  they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleague in Toronto. What they showed is that  initially  you know  subjects perform where they are expected to perform given their age. After two weeks of training on action video games  they actually perform better  and the improvement is still there five months after having done the training. That's really  really important. Why  Because I told you we want to use these games for education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects that are going to be long lasting. Now  at this point  a number of you are probably wondering well  what are you waiting for  to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy  or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has amblyopia  for example  Well  we're working on it  but here is a challenge. There are brain scientists like me that are beginning to understand what are the good ingredients in games to promote positive effects  and that's what I'm going to call the broccoli side of the equation. There is an entertainment software industry which is extremely deft at coming up with appealing products that you can't resist. That's the chocolate side of the equation. The issue is we need to put the two together  and it's a little bit like with food. Who really wants to eat chocolate covered broccoli  None of you.  Laughter  And you probably have had that feeling  right  picking up an education game and sort of feeling  hmm  you know  it's not really fun  it's not really engaging. So what we need is really a new brand of chocolate  a brand of chocolate that is irresistible  that you really want to play  but that has all the ingredients  the good ingredients that are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize but are still working on your brains. And we're working on it  but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together  people that work in the entertainment software industry  and publishers  so these are not people that usually meet every day  but it's actually doable  and we are on the right track. I'd like to leave you with that thought  and thank you for your attention.  Applause  Living with a physical disability isn't easy anywhere in the world  but if you live in a country like the United States  there's certain appurtenances available to you that do make life easier. So if you're in a building  you can take an elevator. If you're crossing the street  you have sidewalk cutouts. And if you have to travel some distance farther than you can do under your own power  there's accessible vehicles  and if you can't afford one of those  there's accessible public transportation. But in the developing world  things are quite different. There's    million people who need a wheelchair but don't have one  and the majority of these people live in rural areas  where the only connections to community  to employment  to education  are by traveling long distances on rough terrain often under their own power. And the devices usually available to these people are not made for that context  break down quickly  and are hard to repair. I started looking at wheelchairs in developing countries in       when I spent the summer assessing the state of technology in Tanzania  and I talked to wheelchair users  wheelchair manufacturers  disability groups  and what stood out to me is that there wasn't a device available that was designed for rural areas  that could go fast and efficiently on many types of terrain. So being a mechanical engineer  being at MIT and having lots of resources available to me  I thought I'd try to do something about it. Now when you're talking about trying to travel long distances on rough terrain  I immediately thought of a mountain bike  and a mountain bike's good at doing this because it has a gear train  and you can shift to a low gear if you have to climb a hill or go through mud or sand and you get a lot of torque but a low speed. And if you want to go faster  say on pavement  you can shift to a high gear  and you get less torque  but higher speeds. So the logical evolution here is to just make a wheelchair with mountain bike components  which many people have done. But these are two products available in the U.S. that would be difficult to transfer into developing countries because they're much  much too expensive. And the context I'm talking about is where you need to have a product that is less than     dollars. And this ideal product would also be able to go about five kilometers a day so you could get to your job  get to school  and do it on many  many different types of terrain. But when you get home or want to go indoors at your work  it's got to be small enough and maneuverable enough to use inside. And furthermore  if you want it to last a long time out in rural areas  it has to be repairable using the local tools  materials and knowledge in those contexts. So the real crux of the problem here is  how do you make a system that's a simple device but gives you a large mechanical advantage  How do you make a mountain bike for your arms that doesn't have the mountain bike cost and complexity  So as is the case with simple solutions  oftentimes the answer is right in front of your face  and for us it was levers. We use levers all the time  in tools  doorknobs  bicycle parts. And that moment of inspiration  that key invention moment  was when I was sitting in front of my design notebook and I started thinking about somebody grabbing a lever  and if they grab near the end of the lever  they can get an effectively long lever and produce a lot of torque as they push back and forth  and effectively get a low gear. And as they slide their hand down the lever  they can push with a smaller effective lever length  but push through a bigger angle every stroke  which makes a faster rotational speed  and gives you an effective high gear. So what's exciting about this system is that it's really  really mechanically simple  and you could make it using technology that's been around for hundreds of years. So seeing this in practice  this is the Leveraged Freedom Chair that  after a few years of development  we're now going into production with  and this is a full time wheelchair user    he's paralyzed    in Guatemala  and you see he's able to traverse pretty rough terrain. Again  the key innovation of this technology is that when he wants to go fast  he just grabs the levers near the pivots and goes through a big angle every stroke  and as the going gets tougher  he just slides his hands up the levers  creates more torque  and kind of bench presses his way out of trouble through the rough terrain. Now the big  important point here is that the person is the complex machine in this system. It's the person that's sliding his hands up and down the levers  so the mechanism itself can be very simple and composed of bicycle parts you can get anywhere in the world. Because those bicycle parts are so ubiquitously available  they're super cheap. They're made by the gazillions in China and India  and we can source them anywhere in the world  build the chair anywhere  and most importantly repair it  even out in a village with a local bicycle mechanic who has local tools  knowledge and parts available. Now  when you want to use the LFC indoors  all you have to do is pull the levers out of the drivetrain  stow them in the frame  and it converts into a normal wheelchair that you can use just like any other normal wheelchair  and we sized it like a normal wheelchair  so it's narrow enough to fit through a standard doorway  it's low enough to fit under a table  and it's small and maneuverable enough to fit in a bathroom and this is important so the user can get up close to a toilet  and be able to transfer off just like he could in a normal wheelchair. Now  there's three important points that I want to stress that I think really hit home in this project. The first is that this product works well because we were effectively able to combine rigorous engineering science and analysis with user centered design focused on the social and usage and economic factors important to wheelchair users in the developing countries. So I'm an academic at MIT  and I'm a mechanical engineer  so I can do things like look at the type of terrain you want to travel on  and figure out how much resistance it should impose  look at the parts we have available and mix and match them to figure out what sort of gear trains we can use  and then look at the power and force you can get out of your upper body to analyze how fast you should be able to go in this chair as you put your arms up and down the levers. So as a wet behind the ears student  excited  our team made a prototype  brought that prototype to Tanzania  Kenya and Vietnam in       and found it was terrible because we didn't get enough input from users. So because we tested it with wheelchair users  with wheelchair manufacturers  we got that feedback from them  not just articulating their problems  but articulating their solutions  and worked together to go back to the drawing board and make a new design  which we brought back to East Africa in '   that worked a lot better than a normal wheelchair on rough terrain  but it still didn't work well indoors because it was too big  it was heavy  it was hard to move around  so again with that user feedback  we went back to the drawing board  came up with a better design     pounds lighter  as narrow as a regular wheelchair  tested that in a field trial in Guatemala  and that advanced the product to the point where we have now that it's going into production. Now also being engineering scientists  we were able to quantify the performance benefits of the Leveraged Freedom Chair  so here are some shots of our trial in Guatemala where we tested the LFC on village terrain  and tested people's biomechanical outputs  their oxygen consumption  how fast they go  how much power they're putting out  both in their regular wheelchairs and using the LFC  and we found that the LFC is about    percent faster going on these terrains than a normal wheelchair. It's also about    percent more efficient than a regular wheelchair  and because of the mechanical advantage you get from the levers  you can produce    percent higher torque and really muscle your way through the really  really rough terrain. Now the second lesson that we learned in this is that the constraints on this design really push the innovation  because we had to hit such a low price point  because we had to make a device that could travel on many  many types of terrain but still be usable indoors  and be simple enough to repair  we ended up with a fundamentally new product  a new product that is an innovation in a space that really hasn't changed in a hundred years. And these are all merits that are not just good in the developing world. Why not in countries like the U.S. too  So we teamed up with Continuum  a local product design firm here in Boston to make the high end version  the developed world version  that we'll probably sell primarily in the U.S. and Europe  but to higher income buyers. And the final point I want to make is that I think this project worked well because we engaged all the stakeholders that buy into this project and are important to consider in bringing the technology from inception of an idea through innovation  validation  commercialization and dissemination  and that cycle has to start and end with end users. These are the people that define the requirements of the technology  and these are the people that have to give the thumbs up at the end  and say   Yeah  it actually works. It meets our needs.  So people like me in the academic space  we can do things like innovate and analyze and test  create data and make bench level prototypes  but how do you get that bench level prototype to commercialization  So we need gap fillers like Continuum that can work on commercializing  and we started a whole NGO to bring our chair to market    Global Research Innovation Technology    and then we also teamed up with a big manufacturer in India  Pinnacle Industries  that's tooled up now to make     chairs a month and will make the first batch of     next month  which will be delivered in India. And then finally  to get this out to the people in scale  we teamed up with the largest disability organization in the world  Jaipur Foot. Now what's powerful about this model is when you bring together all these stakeholders that represent each link in the chain from inception of an idea all the way to implementation in the field  that's where the magic happens. That's where you can take a guy like me  an academic  but analyze and test and create a new technology and quantitatively determine how much better the performance is. You can connect with stakeholders like the manufacturers and talk with them face to face and leverage their local knowledge of manufacturing practices and their clients and combine that knowledge with our engineering knowledge to create something greater than either of us could have done alone. And then you can also engage the end user in the design process  and not just ask him what he needs  but ask him how he thinks it can be achieved. And this picture was taken in India in our last field trial  where we had a    percent adoption rate where people switched to using our Leveraged Freedom Chair over their normal wheelchair  and this picture specifically is of Ashok  and Ashok had a spinal injury when he fell out of a tree  and he had been working at a tailor  but once he was injured he wasn't able to transport himself from his house over a kilometer to his shop in his normal wheelchair. The road was too rough. But the day after he got an LFC  he hopped in it  rode that kilometer  opened up his shop and soon after landed a contract to make school uniforms and started making money  started providing for his family again. Ashok  You also encouraged me to work. I rested for a day at home. The next day I went to my shop. Now everything is back to normal. Amos Winter  And thank you very much for having me today. When I graduated UCLA  I moved to northern California  and I lived in a little town called Elk on the Mendocino coast  and I didn't have a phone or TV  but I had U.S. mail  and life was good back then  if you could remember it. I'd go to the general store for a cup of coffee and a brownie  and I'd ship my film to San Francisco  and lo and behold  two days later  it would end up on my front door  which was way better than having to fight the traffic of Hollywood.  Music  I didn't have much money  but I had time and a sense of wonder.  Music  So I started shooting time lapse photography. It would take me a month to shoot a four minute roll of film  because that's all I could afford. I've been shooting time lapse flowers continuously  non stop     hours a day  seven days a week  for over    years  and to see them move is a dance I'll never get tired of. Their beauty immerses us with color  taste  touch. It also provides a third of the food we eat. Beauty and seduction is nature's tools for survival  because we protect what we fall in love with. It opens our hearts  and makes us realize we are a part of nature and we're not separate from it. When we see ourselves in nature  it also connects us to every one of us  because it's clear that it's all connected in one. When people see my images  a lot of times they'll say   Oh my God.  Have you ever wondered what that meant  The  oh  means it caught your attention  makes you present  makes you mindful. The  my  means it connects with something deep inside your soul. It creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard. And  God   God is that personal journey we all want to be on  to be inspired  to feel like we're connected to a universe that celebrates life. Did you know that    percent of the information we receive comes through our eyes  And if you compare light energy to musical scales  it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see  which is right in the middle  And aren't we grateful for our brains that can  you know  take this electrical impulse that comes from light energy to create images in order for us to explore our world  And aren't we grateful that we have hearts that can feel these vibrations in order for us to allow ourselves to feel the pleasure and the beauty of nature  Nature's beauty is a gift that cultivates appreciation and gratitude. So I have a gift I want to share with you today  a project I'm working on called Happiness Revealed  and it'll give us a glimpse into that perspective from the point of view of a child and an elderly man of that world. Child  When I watch TV  it's just some shows that you just    that are pretend  and when you explore  you get more imagination than you already had  and when you get more imagination  it makes you want to go deeper in so you can get more and see beautifuller things  like the path  if it's a path  it could lead you to a beach  or something  and it could be beautiful. Elderly Man  You think this is just another day in your life  It's not just another day. It's the one day that is given to you today. It's given to you. It's a gift. It's the only gift that you have right now  and the only appropriate response is gratefulness. If you do nothing else but to cultivate that response to the great gift that this unique day is  if you learn to respond as if it were the first day in your life and the very last day  then you will have spent this day very well. Begin by opening your eyes and be surprised that you have eyes you can open  that incredible array of colors that is constantly offered to us for pure enjoyment. Look at the sky. We so rarely look at the sky. We so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment  with clouds coming and going. We just think of the weather  and even with the weather  we don't think of all the many nuances of weather. We just think of good weather and bad weather. This day  right now  has unique weather  maybe a kind that will never exactly in that form come again. That formation of clouds in the sky will never be the same as it is right now. Open your eyes. Look at that. Look at the faces of people whom you meet. Each one has an incredible story behind their face  a story that you could never fully fathom  not only their own story  but the story of their ancestors. We all go back so far  and in this present moment  on this day  all the people you meet  all that life from generations and from so many places all over the world flows together and meets you here like a life giving water  if you only open your heart and drink. Open your heart to the incredible gifts that civilization gives to us. You flip a switch and there is electric light. You turn a faucet and there is warm water and cold water  and drinkable water. It's a gift that millions and millions in the world will never experience. So these are just a few of an enormous number of gifts to which we can open your heart. And so I wish you that you will open your heart to all these blessings  and let them flow through you  that everyone whom you will meet on this day will be blessed by you  just by your eyes  by your smile  by your touch  just by your presence. Let the gratefulness overflow into blessing all around you  and then it will really be a good day.  Music  Louie Schwartzberg  Thank you. Thank you very much.  Applause  There are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives. We don't bump into every neighbor  so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on  though we do share the same public spaces. So over the past few years  I've tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space  using simple tools like stickers  stencils and chalk. And these projects came from questions I had  like  How much are my neighbors paying for their apartments  How can we lend and borrow more things  without knocking on each other's doors at a bad time  How can we share more memories of our abandoned buildings  and gain a better understanding of our landscape  How can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts  so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today  Now  I live in New Orleans  and I am in love with New Orleans. My soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees  shading lovers  drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years  and I trust a city that always makes way for music. I feel like every time someone sneezes  New Orleans has a parade. The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world  but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America. I live near this house  and I thought about how I could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood  and I also thought about something that changed my life forever. In       I lost someone I loved very much. Her name was Joan  and she was a mother to me. And her death was sudden and unexpected. And I thought about death a lot. And ... this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I've had. And ... brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now. But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life. I feel like it's easy to get caught up in the day to day  and forget what really matters to you. So with help from old and new friends  I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard  and stenciled it with a fill in the blank sentence   Before I die  I want to ...  So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk  reflect on their life  and share their personal aspirations in public space. I didn't know what to expect from this experiment  but by the next day  the wall was entirely filled out  and it kept growing. And I'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall.  Before I die  I want to be tried for piracy.   Before I die  I want to straddle the International Dateline.   Before I die  I want to sing for millions.   Before I die  I want to plant a tree.   Before I die  I want to live off the grid.   Before I die  I want to hold her one more time.   Before I die  I want to be someone's cavalry.   Before I die  I want to be completely myself.  So this neglected space became a constructive one  and people's hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud  tear up  and they consoled me during my own tough times. It's about knowing you're not alone  it's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways  it's about making space for reflection and contemplation  and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change. I made this last year  and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community. So  my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit  and now walls have been made in countries around the world  including Kazakhstan  South Africa  Australia  Argentina  and beyond. Together  we've shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we're given the opportunity to have a voice  and share more with one another. Two of the most valuable things we have are time  and our relationships with other people. In our age of increasing distractions  it's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective  and remember that life is brief and tender. Death is something that we're often discouraged to talk about  or even think about  but I've realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do. Thinking about death clarifies your life. Our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us  as individuals and as a community  and with more ways to share our hopes  fears and stories  the people around us can not only help us make better places  they can help us lead better lives. Thank you. Thank you. Everything I do  and everything I do professionally    my life    has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa. From      to         I look young  but I'm not    Laughter     I worked in Zambia  Kenya  Ivory Coast  Algeria  Somalia  in projects of technical cooperation with African countries. I worked for an Italian NGO  and every single project that we set up in Africa failed. And I was distraught. I thought  age     that we Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa. Instead  everything we touched we killed. Our first project  the one that has inspired my first book   Ripples from the Zambezi   was a project where we Italians decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food. So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Zambezi River  and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes and zucchini and ... And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that  so we paid them to come and work  and sometimes they would show up.  Laughter  And we were amazed that the local people  in such a fertile valley  would not have any agriculture. But instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything  we simply said   Thank God we're here.   Laughter   Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation.  And of course  everything in Africa grew beautifully. We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy  a tomato would grow to this size. In Zambia  to this size. And we could not believe  and we were telling the Zambians   Look how easy agriculture is.  When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red  overnight  some     hippos came out from the river and they ate everything.  Laughter  And we said to the Zambians   My God  the hippos   And the Zambians said   Yes  that's why we have no agriculture here.   Laughter   Why didn't you tell us   You never asked.  I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa  but then I saw what the Americans were doing  what the English were doing  what the French were doing  and after seeing what they were doing  I became quite proud of our project in Zambia. Because  you see  at least we fed the hippos. You should see the rubbish    Applause     You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting African people. You want to read the book  read  Dead Aid   by Dambisa Moyo  Zambian woman economist. The book was published in     . We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last    years. I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done. Just go and read her book. Read it from an African woman  the damage that we have done. We Western people are imperialist  colonialist missionaries  and there are only two ways we deal with people  We either patronize them  or we are paternalistic. The two words come from the Latin root  pater   which means  father.  But they mean two different things. Paternalistic  I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children.  I love you so much.  Patronizing  I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants. That's why the white people in Africa are called  bwana   boss. I was given a slap in the face reading a book   Small is Beautiful   written by Schumacher  who said  above all in economic development  if people do not wish to be helped  leave them alone. This should be the first principle of aid. The first principle of aid is respect. This morning  the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor  and said   Can we    can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial   I decided when I was    years old to only respond to people  and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation  where you never initiate anything  you never motivate anybody  but you become a servant of the local passion  the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person. So what you do    you shut up. You never arrive in a community with any ideas  and you sit with the local people. We don't work from offices. We meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub. We have zero infrastructure. And what we do  we become friends  and we find out what that person wants to do. The most important thing is passion. You can give somebody an idea. If that person doesn't want to do it  what are you going to do  The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing. The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing. And then we help them to go and find the knowledge  because nobody in the world can succeed alone. The person with the idea may not have the knowledge  but the knowledge is available. So years and years ago  I had this idea  Why don't we  for once  instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do  why don't  for once  listen to them  But not in community meetings. Let me tell you a secret. There is a problem with community meetings. Entrepreneurs never come  and they never tell you  in a public meeting  what they want to do with their own money  what opportunity they have identified. So planning has this blind spot. The smartest people in your community you don't even know  because they don't come to your public meetings. What we do  we work one on one  and to work one on one  you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist. You have to create a new profession. The profession is the family doctor of enterprise  the family doctor of business  who sits with you in your house  at your kitchen table  at the cafe  and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living. I started this as a tryout in Esperance  in Western Australia. I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time  trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do. And so what I did in Esperance that first year was to just walk the streets  and in three days I had my first client  and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage  was a Maori guy  and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth  to get organized  and then the fishermen came to me to say   You the guy who helped Maori  Can you help us   And I helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany for    cents a kilo  but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to Japan for    dollars a kilo  and the farmers came to talk to me  said   Hey  you helped them. Can you help us   In a year  I had    projects going on  and the government came to see me to say   How can you do that  How can you do      And I said   I do something very  very  very difficult. I shut up  and listen to them.   Laughter  So    Applause    So the government says   Do it again.   Laughter  We've done it in     communities around the world. We have helped to start        businesses. There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude. Peter Drucker  one of the greatest management consultants in history  died age     a few years ago. Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business  and this is what Peter Drucker says   Planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy.  Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship. So now you're rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy. You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you. You have to offer them confidentiality  privacy  you have to be fantastic at helping them  and then they will come  and they will come in droves. In a community of        people  we get     clients. Can you imagine a community of         people  the intelligence and the passion  Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning  Local  passionate people. That's who you have applauded. So what I'm saying is that entrepreneurship is where it's at. We are at the end of the first industrial revolution    nonrenewable fossil fuels  manufacturing    and all of a sudden  we have systems which are not sustainable. The internal combustion engine is not sustainable. Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable. What we have to look at is at how we feed  cure  educate  transport  communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way. The technologies do not exist to do that. Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution  Universities  Forget about it  Government  Forget about it  It will be entrepreneurs  and they're doing it now. There's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine many  many years ago. There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in     . And in       this group of people came together  and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of New York in     years  and the conclusion was unanimous  The city of New York would not exist in     years. Why  Because they looked at the curve and said  if the population keeps growing at this rate  to move the population of New York around  they would have needed six million horses  and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with. They were already drowning in manure.  Laughter  So       they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of New York. So what happens  In    years' time  in the year       in the United States of America  there were       car manufacturing companies         . The idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over  and there were tiny  tiny little factories in backwaters. Dearborn  Michigan. Henry Ford. However  there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs. First  you have to offer them confidentiality. Otherwise they don't come and talk to you. Then you have to offer them absolute  dedicated  passionate service to them. And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship. The smallest company  the biggest company  has to be capable of doing three things beautifully  The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic  you have to have fantastic marketing  and you have to have tremendous financial management. Guess what  We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it  sell it and look after the money. It doesn't exist. This person has never been born. We've done the research  and we have looked at the     iconic companies of the world    Carnegie  Westinghouse  Edison  Ford  all the new companies  Google  Yahoo. There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common  only one  None were started by one person. Now we teach entrepreneurship to    year olds in Northumberland  and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography  and the task of the    year olds is to underline  in the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography how many times Richard uses the word  I  and how many times he uses the word  we.  Never the word  I   and the word  we     times. He wasn't alone when he started. Nobody started a company alone. No one. So we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes  in bars  and your dedicated buddies who will do to you  what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic  somebody who will say to you   What do you need  What can you do  Can you make it  Okay  can you sell it  Can you look after the money    Oh  no  I cannot do this.  Would you like me to find you somebody   We activate communities. We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion  the energy and imagination of your own people. Thank you.  Applause  Hi. I'm here to talk about congestion  namely road congestion. Road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon. It exists in basically all of the cities all around the world  which is a little bit surprising when you think about it. I mean  think about how different cities are  actually. I mean  you have the typical European cities  with a dense urban core  good public transportation mostly  not a lot of road capacity. But then  on the other hand  you have the American cities. It's moving by itself  okay. Anyway  the American cities  lots of roads dispersed over large areas  almost no public transportation. And then you have the emerging world cities  with a mixed variety of vehicles  mixed land use patterns  also rather dispersed but often with a very dense urban core. And traffic planners all around the world have tried lots of different measures  dense cities or dispersed cities  lots of roads or lots of public transport or lots of bike lanes or more information  or lots of different things  but nothing seems to work. But all of these attempts have one thing in common. They're basically attempts at figuring out what people should do instead of rush hour car driving. They're essentially  to a point  attempts at planning what other people should do  planning their life for them. Now  planning a complex social system is a very hard thing to do  and let me tell you a story. Back in       when the Berlin Wall fell  an urban planner in London got a phone call from a colleague in Moscow saying  basically   Hi  this is Vladimir. I'd like to know  who's in charge of London's bread supply   And the urban planner in London goes   What do you mean  who's in charge of London's   I mean  no one is in charge.   Oh  but surely someone must be in charge. I mean  it's a very complicated system. Someone must control all of this.   No. No. No one is in charge. I mean  it basically    I haven't really thought of it. It basically organizes itself.  It organizes itself. That's an example of a complex social system which has the ability of self organizing  and this is a very deep insight. When you try to solve really complex social problems  the right thing to do is most of the time to create the incentives. You don't plan the details  and people will figure out what to do  how to adapt to this new framework. And let's now look at how we can use this insight to combat road congestion. This is a map of Stockholm  my hometown. Now  Stockholm is a medium sized city  roughly two million people  but Stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water means lots of bridges    narrow bridges  old bridges    which means lots of road congestion. And these red dots show the most congested parts  which are the bridges that lead into the inner city. And then someone came up with the idea that  apart from good public transport  apart from spending money on roads  let's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks. Now  one or two euros  that isn't really a lot of money  I mean compared to parking charges and running costs  etc.  so you would probably expect that car drivers wouldn't really react to this fairly small charge. You would be wrong. One or two euros was enough to make    percent of cars disappear from rush hours. Now     percent  well  that's a fairly huge figure  you might think  but you've still got    percent left of the problem  right  Because you still have    percent of the traffic. Now  that's also wrong  because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon  meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really  really rapidly. But fortunately  it also works the other way around. If you can reduce traffic even somewhat  then congestion will go down much faster than you might think. Now  congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm on January          and the first picture here is a picture of Stockholm  one of the typical streets  January  . The first day with the congestion charges looked like this. This is what happens when you take away    percent of the cars from the streets. You really reduce congestion quite substantially. But  well  as I said  I mean  car drivers adapt  right  So after a while they would all come back because they have sort of gotten used to charges. Wrong again. It's now six and a half years ago since the congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm  and we basically have the same low traffic levels still. But you see  there's an interesting gap here in the time series in     . Well  the thing is that  the congestion charges  they were introduced first as a trial  so they were introduced in January and then abolished again at the end of July  followed by a referendum  and then they were reintroduced again in       which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity. I mean  this was a really fun experiment to start with  and we actually got to do it twice. And personally  I would like to do this every once a year or so  but they won't let me do that. But it was fun anyway. So  we followed up. What happened  This is the last day with the congestion charges  July     and you see the same street but now it's summer  and summer in Stockholm is a very nice and light time of the year  and the first day without the congestion charges looked like this. All the cars were back again  and you even have to admire the car drivers. They adapt so extremely quickly. The first day they all came back. And this effect hanged on. So      figures looked like this. Now these traffic figures are really exciting and a little bit surprising and very useful to know  but I would say that the most surprising slide here I'm going to show you today is not this one. It's this one. This shows public support for congestion pricing of Stockholm  and you see that when congestion pricing were introduced in the beginning of Spring       people were fiercely against it. Seventy percent of the population didn't want this. But what happened when the congestion charges were there is not what you would expect  that people hated it more and more. No  on the contrary  they changed  up to a point where we now have    percent support for keeping the charges  meaning that    I mean  let me repeat that     percent of the population in Stockholm want to keep a price for something that used to be free. Okay. So why can that be  Why is that  Well  think about it this way. Who changed  I mean  the    percent of the car drivers that disappeared  surely they must be discontent in a way. And where did they go  If we can understand this  then maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this. Well  so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services  and tried to figure out who changed  and where did they go  And it turned out that they don't know themselves.  Laughter  For some reason  the car drivers are    they are confident they actually drive the same way that they used to do. And why is that  It's because that travel patterns are much less stable than you might think. Each day  people make new decisions  and people change and the world changes around them  and each day all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly away from rush hour car driving in a way that people don't even notice. They're not even aware of this themselves. And the other question  who changed their mind  Who changed their opinion  and why  So we did another interview survey  tried to figure out why people changed their mind  and what type of group changed their minds  And after analyzing the answers  it turned out that more than half of them believe that they haven't changed their minds. They're actually confident that they have liked congestion pricing all along. Which means that we are now in a position where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon with    percent  and reduced congestion by enormous numbers  and people aren't even aware that they have changed  and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along. This is the power of nudges when trying to solve complex social problems  and when you do that  you shouldn't try to tell people how to adapt. You should just nudge them in the right direction. And if you do it right  people will actually embrace the change  and if you do it right  people will actually even like it. Thank you.  Applause  Life is about opportunities  creating them and embracing them  and for me  that was the Olympic dream. That's what defined me. That was my bliss. As a cross country skier and member of the Australian ski team  headed towards the Winter Olympics  I was on a training bike ride with my fellow teammates. As we made our way up towards the spectacular Blue Mountains west of Sydney  it was the perfect autumn day  sunshine  the smell of eucalypt and a dream. Life was good. We'd been on our bikes for around five and half hours when we got to the part of the ride that I loved  and that was the hills  because I loved the hills. And I got up off the seat of my bike  and I started pumping my legs  and as I sucked in the cold mountain air  I could feel it burning my lungs  and I looked up to see the sun shining in my face. And then everything went black. Where was I  What was happening  My body was consumed by pain. I'd been hit by a speeding utility truck with only    minutes to go on the bike ride. I was airlifted from the scene of the accident by a rescue helicopter to a large spinal unit in Sydney. I had extensive and life threatening injuries. I'd broken my neck and my back in six places. I broke five ribs on my left side. I broke my right arm. I broke my collarbone. I broke some bones in my feet. My whole right side was ripped open  filled with gravel. My head was cut open across the front  lifted back  exposing the skull underneath. I had head injures. I had internal injuries. I had massive blood loss. In fact  I lost about five liters of blood  which is all someone my size would actually hold. By the time the helicopter arrived at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney  my blood pressure was    over nothing. I was having a really bad day.  Laughter  For over    days  I drifted between two dimensions. I had an awareness of being in my body  but also being out of my body  somewhere else  watching from above as if it was happening to someone else. Why would I want to go back to a body that was so broken  But this voice kept calling me   Come on  stay with me.   No. It's too hard.   Come on. This is our opportunity.   No. That body is broken. It can no longer serve me.   Come on. Stay with me. We can do it. We can do it together.  I was at a crossroads. I knew if I didn't return to my body  I'd have to leave this world forever. It was the fight of my life. After    days  I made the decision to return to my body  and the internal bleeding stopped. The next concern was whether I would walk again  because I was paralyzed from the waist down. They said to my parents  the neck break was a stable fracture  but the back was completely crushed. The vertebra at L  was like you'd dropped a peanut  stepped on it  smashed it into thousands of pieces. They'd have to operate. They went in. They put me on a beanbag. They cut me  literally cut me in half  I have a scar that wraps around my entire body. They picked as much broken bone as they could that had lodged in my spinal cord. They took out two of my broken ribs  and they rebuilt my back  L   they rebuilt it  they took out another broken rib  they fused T    L  and L  together. Then they stitched me up. They took an entire hour to stitch me up. I woke up in intensive care  and the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success because at that stage I had a little bit of movement in one of my big toes  and I thought   Great  because I'm going to the Olympics   I had no idea. That's the sort of thing that happens to someone else  not me  surely. But then the doctor came over to me  and she said   Janine  the operation was a success  and we've picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could  but the damage is permanent. The central nervous system nerves  there is no cure. You're what we call a partial paraplegic  and you'll have all of the injuries that go along with that. You have no feeling from the waist down  and at most  you might get     or    percent return. You'll have internal injuries for the rest of your life. You'll have to use a catheter for the rest of your life. And if you walk again  it will be with calipers and a walking frame.  And then she said   Janine  you'll have to rethink everything you do in your life  because you're never going to be able to do the things you did before.  I tried to grasp what she was saying. I was an athlete. That's all I knew. That's all I'd done. If I couldn't do that  then what could I do  And the question I asked myself is  if I couldn't do that  then who was I  They moved me from intensive care to acute spinal. I was lying on a thin  hard spinal bed. I had no movement in my legs. I had tight stockings on to protect from blood clots. I had one arm in plaster  one arm tied down by drips. I had a neck brace and sandbags on either side of my head and I saw my world through a mirror that was suspended above my head. I shared the ward with five other people  and the amazing thing is that because we were all lying paralyzed in a spinal ward  we didn't know what each other looked like. How amazing is that  How often in life do you get to make friendships  judgment free  purely based on spirit  And there were no superficial conversations as we shared our innermost thoughts  our fears  and our hopes for life after the spinal ward. I remember one night  one of the nurses came in  Jonathan  with a whole lot of plastic straws. He put a pile on top of each of us  and he said   Start threading them together.  Well  there wasn't much else to do in the spinal ward  so we did. And when we'd finished  he went around silently and he joined all of the straws up till it looped around the whole ward  and then he said   Okay  everybody  hold on to your straws.  And we did. And he said   Right. Now we're all connected.  And as we held on  and we breathed as one  we knew we weren't on this journey alone. And even lying paralyzed in the spinal ward  there were moments of incredible depth and richness  of authenticity and connection that I had never experienced before. And each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward we would never be the same. After six months  it was time to go home. I remember Dad pushing me outside in my wheelchair  wrapped in a plaster body cast  and feeling the sun on my face for the first time. I soaked it up and I thought  how could I ever have taken this for granted  I felt so incredibly grateful for my life. But before I left the hospital  the head nurse had said to me   Janine  I want you to be ready  because when you get home  something's going to happen.  And I said   What   And she said   You're going to get depressed.  And I said   Not me  not Janine the Machine   which was my nickname. She said   You are  because  see  it happens to everyone. In the spinal ward  that's normal. You're in a wheelchair. That's normal. But you're going to get home and realize how different life is.  And I got home and something happened. I realized Sister Sam was right. I did get depressed. I was in my wheelchair. I had no feeling from the waist down  attached to a catheter bottle. I couldn't walk. I'd lost so much weight in the hospital I now weighed about    pounds. And I wanted to give up. All I wanted to do was put my running shoes on and run out the door. I wanted my old life back. I wanted my body back. And I can remember Mom sitting on the end of my bed  and saying   I wonder if life will ever be good again.  And I thought   How could it  Because I've lost everything that I valued  everything that I'd worked towards. Gone.  And the question I asked was   Why me  Why me   And then I remembered my friends that were still in the spinal ward  particularly Maria. Maria was in a car accident  and she woke up on her   th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic  had no movement from the neck down  had damage to her vocal chords  and she couldn't talk. They told me   We're going to move you next to her because we think it will be good for her.  I was worried. I didn't know how I'd react to being next to her. I knew it would be challenging  but it was actually a blessing  because Maria always smiled. She was always happy  and even when she began to talk again  albeit difficult to understand  she never complained  not once. And I wondered how had she ever found that level of acceptance. And I realized that this wasn't just my life. It was life itself. I realized that this wasn't just my pain. It was everybody's pain. And then I knew  just like before  that I had a choice. I could keep fighting this or I could let go and accept not only my body but the circumstances of my life. And then I stopped asking   Why me   And I started to ask   Why not me   And then I thought to myself  maybe being at rock bottom is actually the perfect place to start. I had never before thought of myself as a creative person. I was an athlete. My body was a machine. But now I was about to embark on the most creative project that any of us could ever do  that of rebuilding a life. And even though I had absolutely no idea what I was going to do  in that uncertainty came a sense of freedom. I was no longer tied to a set path. I was free to explore life's infinite possibilities. And that realization was about to change my life. Sitting at home in my wheelchair and my plaster body cast  an airplane flew overhead  and I looked up  and I thought to myself   That's it  If I can't walk  then I might as well fly.  I said   Mom  I'm going to learn how to fly.  She said   That's nice  dear.   Laughter  I said   Pass me the yellow pages.  She passed me the phone book  I rang up the flying school  I made a booking  said I'd like to make a booking to come out for a flight. They said   You know  when do you want to come out   I said   Well  I have to get a friend to drive me out because I can't drive. Sort of can't walk either. Is that a problem   I made a booking  and weeks later my friend Chris and my mom drove me out to the airport  all    pounds of me covered in a plaster body cast in a baggy pair of overalls.  Laughter  I can tell you  I did not look like the ideal candidate to get a pilot's license.  Laughter  I'm holding on to the counter because I can't stand. I said   Hi  I'm here for a flying lesson.  And they took one look and ran out the back to draw short straws.  You get her.  No  no  you take her.  Finally this guy comes out. He goes   Hi  I'm Andrew  and I'm going to take you flying.  I go   Great.  And so they drive me down  they get me out on the tarmac  and there was this red  white and blue airplane. It was beautiful. They lifted me into the cockpit. They had to slide me up on the wing  put me in the cockpit. They sat me down. There are buttons and dials everywhere. I'm going   Wow  how do you ever know what all these buttons and dials do   Andrew the instructor got in the front  started the airplane up. He said   Would you like to have a go at taxiing   That's when you use your feet to control the rudder pedals to control the airplane on the ground. I said   No  I can't use my legs.  He went   Oh.  I said   But I can use my hands   and he said   Okay.  So he got over to the runway  and he applied the power. And as we took off down the runway  and the wheels lifted up off the tarmac  and we became airborne  I had the most incredible sense of freedom. And Andrew said to me  as we got over the training area   You see that mountain over there   And I said   Yeah.  And he said   Well  you take the controls  and you fly towards that mountain.  And as I looked up  I realized that he was pointing towards the Blue Mountains where the journey had begun. And I took the controls  and I was flying. And I was a long  long way from that spinal ward  and I knew right then that I was going to be a pilot. Didn't know how on Earth I'd ever pass a medical. But I'd worry about that later  because right now I had a dream. So I went home  I got a training diary out  and I had a plan. And I practiced my walking as much as I could  and I went from the point of two people holding me up to one person holding me up to the point where I could walk around the furniture as long as it wasn't too far apart. And then I made great progression to the point where I could walk around the house  holding onto the walls  like this  and Mom said she was forever following me  wiping off my fingerprints.  Laughter  But at least she always knew where I was. So while the doctors continued to operate and put my body back together again  I went on with my theory study  and then eventually  and amazingly  I passed my pilot's medical  and that was my green light to fly. And I spent every moment I could out at that flying school  way out of my comfort zone  all these young guys that wanted to be Qantas pilots  you know  and little old hop along me in first my plaster cast  and then my steel brace  my baggy overalls  my bag of medication and catheters and my limp  and they used to look at me and think   Oh  who is she kidding  She's never going to be able to do this.  And sometimes I thought that too. But that didn't matter  because now there was something inside that burned that far outweighed my injuries. And little goals kept me going along the way  and eventually I got my private pilot's license  and then I learned to navigate  and I flew my friends around Australia. And then I learned to fly an airplane with two engines and I got my twin engine rating. And then I learned to fly in bad weather as well as fine weather and got my instrument rating. And then I got my commercial pilot's license. And then I got my instructor rating. And then I found myself back at that same school where I'd gone for that very first flight  teaching other people how to fly  just under    months after I'd left the spinal ward. And then I thought   Why stop there  Why not learn to fly upside down   And I did  and I learned to fly upside down and became an aerobatics flying instructor. And Mom and Dad  Never been up. But then I knew for certain that although my body might be limited  it was my spirit that was unstoppable. The philosopher Lao Tzu once said   When you let go of what you are  you become what you might be.  I now know that it wasn't until I let go of who I thought I was that I was able to create a completely new life. It wasn't until I let go of the life I thought I should have that I was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me. I now know that my real strength never came from my body  and although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically  who I am is unchanged. The pilot light inside of me was still a light  just as it is in each and every one of us. I know that I'm not my body  and I also know that you're not yours. And then it no longer matters what you look like  where you come from  or what you do for a living. All that matters is that we continue to fan the flame of humanity by living our lives as the ultimate creative expression of who we really are  because we are all connected by millions and millions of straws  and it's time to join those up and to hang on. And if we are to move towards our collective bliss  it's time we shed our focus on the physical and instead embrace the virtues of the heart. So raise your straws if you'll join me. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals. There are        species of birds in the world. Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds. When you see a vulture like this  the first thing that comes to your mind is  these are disgusting  ugly  greedy creatures that are just after your flesh  associated with politicians.  Laughter   Applause  I want to change that perception. I want to change those feelings you have for these birds  because they need our sympathy. They really do.  Laughter  And I'll tell you why. First of all  why do they have such a bad press  When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in      on the Beagle  he saw the turkey vulture  and he said   These are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity.   Laughter  You could not get a worse insult  and that from Charles Darwin.  Laughter  You know  he changed his mind when he came back  and I'll tell you why. They've also be associated with Disney    Laughter    personified as goofy  dumb  stupid characters. More recently  if you've been following the Kenyan press    Laughter   Applause   Cheers    these are the attributes that they associated the Kenyan MPs with. But I want to challenge that. I want to challenge that. Do you know why  Because MPs do not keep the environment clean.  Laughter  MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases. They are hardly monogamous.  Laughter   Applause  They are far from being extinct.  Laughter  And  my favorite is  vultures are better looking.  Applause   Laughter  So there's two types of vultures in this planet. There are the New World vultures that are mainly found in the Americas  like the condors and the caracaras  and then the Old World vultures  where we have    species. From these        of them are facing a high risk of extinction. So why are vultures important  First of all  they provide vital ecological services. They clean up. They're our natural garbage collectors. They clean up carcasses right to the bone. They help to kill all the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals. Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures  carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose  and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases. Vultures also have tremendous historical significance. They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture. Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood  and together with the cobra  symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt. In Hindu mythology  Jatayu was the vulture god  and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita from the    headed demon Ravana. In Tibetan culture  they are performing very important sky burials. In places like Tibet  there are no places to bury the dead  or wood to cremate them  so these vultures provide a natural disposal system. So what is the problem with vultures  We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya  of which six are highly threatened with extinction. The reason is that they're getting poisoned  and the reason that they're getting poisoned is because there's human wildlife conflicts. The pastoral communities are using this poison to target predators  and in return  the vultures are falling victim to this. In South Asia  in countries like India and Pakistan  four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered  which means they have less than    or    years to go extinct  and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac. This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India  and they have taken a stand. Because there are no vultures  there's been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites  and when you have feral dogs  you have a huge time bomb of rabies. The number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in India. Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa      wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana. I am not against wind energy  but we need to work with the governments  because wind turbines do this to birds. They slice them in half. They are bird blending machines. In West Africa  there's a horrific trade of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market. So what's being done  Well  we're conducting research on these birds. We're putting transmitters on them. We're trying to determine their basic ecology  and see where they go. We can see that they travel different countries  so if you focus on a problem locally  it's not going to help you. We need to work with governments in regional levels. We're working with local communities. We're talking to them about appreciating vultures  about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide. How can you help  You can become active  make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very misunderstood creatures. Volunteer your time to spread the word. Spread the word. When you walk out of this room  you will be informed about vultures  but speak to your families  to your children  to your neighbors about vultures. They are very graceful. Charles Darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effortlessly without energy in the skies. Kenya  this world  will be much poorer without these wonderful species. Thank you very much.  Applause  I'm going to talk about the power of a word  jihad. To the vast majority of practicing Muslims  jihad is an internal struggle for the faith. It is a struggle within  a struggle against vice  sin  temptation  lust  greed. It is a struggle to try and live a life that is set by the moral codes written in the Koran. In that original idea  the concept of jihad is as important to Muslims as the idea of grace is to Christians. It's a very powerful word  jihad  if you look at it in that respect  and there's a certain almost mystical resonance to it. And that's the reason why  for hundreds of years  Muslims everywhere have named their children Jihad  their daughters as much as their sons  in the same way that  say  Christians name their daughters Grace  and Hindus  my people  name our daughters Bhakti  which means  in Sanskrit  spiritual worship. But there have always been  in Islam  a small group  a minority  who believe that jihad is not only an internal struggle but also an external struggle against forces that would threaten the faith  or the faithul. And some of these people believe that in that struggle  it is sometimes okay to take up arms. And so the thousands of young Muslim men who flocked to Afghanistan in the     s to fight against the Soviet occupation of a Muslim country  in their minds they were fighting a jihad  they were doing jihad  and they named themselves the Mujahideen  which is a word that comes from the same root as jihad. And we forget this now  but back then the Mujahideen were celebrated in this country  in America. We thought of them as holy warriors who were taking the good fight to the ungodly communists. America gave them weapons  gave them money  gave them support  encouragement. But within that group  a tiny  smaller group  a minority within a minority within a minority  were coming up with a new and dangerous conception of jihad  and in time this group would come to be led by Osama bin Laden  and he refined the idea. His idea of jihad was a global war of terror  primarily targeted at the far enemy  at the crusaders from the West  against America. And the things he did in the pursuit of this jihad were so horrendous  so monstrous  and had such great impact  that his definition was the one that stuck  not just here in the West. We didn't know any better. We didn't pause to ask. We just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers were calling what they did jihad  then that's what jihad must mean. But it wasn't just us. Even in the Muslim world  his definition of jihad began to gain acceptance. A year ago I was in Tunis  and I met the imam of a very small mosque  an old man. Fifteen years ago  he named his granddaughter Jihad  after the old meaning. He hoped that a name like that would inspire her to live a spiritual life. But he told me that after       he began to have second thoughts. He worried that if he called her by that name  especially outdoors  outside in public  he might be seen as endorsing bin Laden's idea of jihad. On Fridays in his mosque  he gave sermons trying to reclaim the meaning of the word  but his congregants  the people who came to his mosque  they had seen the videos. They had seen pictures of the planes going into the towers  the towers coming down. They had heard bin Laden say that that was jihad  and claimed victory for it. And so the old imam worried that his words were falling on deaf ears. No one was paying attention. He was wrong. Some people were paying attention  but for the wrong reasons. The United States  at this point  was putting pressure on all its Arab allies  including Tunisia  to stamp out extremism in their societies  and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs of the Tunisian intelligence service. They had never paid him any attention before    old man  small mosque    but now they began to pay visits  and sometimes they would drag him in for questions  and always the same question   Why did you name your granddaughter Jihad  Why do you keep using the word jihad in your Friday sermons  Do you hate Americans  What is your connection to Osama bin Laden   So to the Tunisian intelligence agency  and organizations like it all over the Arab world  jihad equaled extremism  Bin Laden's definition had become institutionalized. That was the power of that word that he was able to do. And it filled this old imam  it filled him with great sadness. He told me that  of bin Laden's many crimes  this was  in his mind  one that didn't get enough attention  that he took this word  this beautiful idea. He didn't so much appropriate it as kidnapped it and debased it and corrupted it and turned it into something it was never meant to be  and then persuaded all of us that it always was a global jihad. But the good news is that the global jihad is almost over  as bin Laden defined it. It was dying well before he did  and now it's on its last legs. Opinion polls from all over the Muslim world show that there is very little interest among Muslims in a global holy war against the West  against the far enemy. The supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling. The supply of money   just as important  more important perhaps   the supply of money to this activity is also dwindling. The wealthy fanatics who were previously sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous. What does that mean for us in the West  Does it mean we can break out the champagne  wash our hands of it  disengage  sleep easy at night  No. Disengagement is not an option  because if you let local jihad survive  it becomes international jihad. And so there's now a lot of different violent jihads all over the world. In Somalia  in Mali  in Nigeria  in Iraq  in Afghanistan  Pakistan  there are groups that claim to be the inheritors of the legacy of Osama bin Laden. They use his rhetoric. They even use the brand name he created for his jihad. So there is now an al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb  there's an al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula  there is an al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. There are other groups    in Nigeria  Boko Haram  in Somalia  al Shabaab    and they all pay homage to Osama bin Laden. But if you look closely  they're not fighting a global jihad. They're fighting battles over much narrower issues. Usually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism  or it's a power struggle. More often than not  it's a power struggle in one country  or even a small region within one country. Occasionally they will go across a border  from Iraq to Syria  from Mali to Algeria  from Somalia to Kenya  but they're not fighting a global jihad against some far enemy. But that doesn't mean that we can relax. I was in Yemen recently  where    it's the home of the last al Qaeda franchise that still aspires to attack America  attack the West. It's old school al Qaeda. You may remember these guys. They are the ones who tried to send the underwear bomber here  and they were using the Internet to try and instigate violence among American Muslims. But they have been distracted recently. Last year  they took control over a portion of southern Yemen  and ran it  Taliban style. And then the Yemeni military got its act together  and ordinary people rose up against these guys and drove them out  and since then  most of their activities  most of their attacks have been directed at Yemenis. So I think we've come to a point now where we can say that  just like all politics  all jihad is local. But that's still not reason for us to disengage  because we've seen that movie before  in Afghanistan. When those Mujahideen defeated the Soviet Union  we disengaged. And even before the fizz had gone out of our celebratory champagne  the Taliban had taken over in Kabul  and we said   Local jihad  not our problem.  And then the Taliban gave the keys of Kandahar to Osama bin Laden. He made it our problem. Local jihad  if you ignore it  becomes global jihad again. The good news is that it doesn't have to be. We know how to fight it now. We have the tools. We have the knowhow  and we can take the lessons we've learned from the fight against global jihad  the victory against global jihad  and apply those to local jihad. What are those lessons  We know who killed bin Laden  SEAL Team Six. Do we know  do we understand  who killed bin Ladenism  Who ended the global jihad  There lie the answers to the solution to local jihad. Who killed bin Ladenism  Let's start with bin Laden himself. He probably thought      was his greatest achievement. In reality  it was the beginning of the end for him. He killed       innocent people  and that filled the Muslim world with horror and revulsion  and what that meant was that his idea of jihad could never become mainstream. He condemned himself to operating on the lunatic fringes of his own community.      didn't empower him  it doomed him. Who killed bin Ladenism  Abu Musab al Zarqawi killed it. He was the especially sadistic head of al Qaeda in Iraq who sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack not Americans but Iraqis. Muslims. Sunni as well as Shiites. Any claim that al Qaeda had to being protectors of Islam against the Western crusaders was drowned in the blood of Iraqi Muslims. Who killed Osama bin Laden  The SEAL Team Six. Who killed bin Ladenism  Al Jazeera did  Al Jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in Arabic  because they circumvented the old  state owned television stations in a lot of these countries which were designed to keep information from people. Al Jazeera brought information to them  showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion  exposed the hypocrisy of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda  and allowed them  gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclusions. Who killed bin Ladenism  The Arab Spring did  because it showed a way for young Muslims to bring about change in a manner that Osama bin Laden  with his limited imagination  could never have conceived. Who defeated the global jihad  The American military did  the American soldiers did  with their allies  fighting in faraway battlefields. And perhaps  a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it. So all these factors  and many more besides  we don't even fully understand some of them yet  these came together to defeat a monstrosity as big as bin Ladenism  the global jihad  you needed this group effort. Now  not all of these things will work in local jihad. The American military is not going to march into Nigeria to take on Boko Haram  and it's unlikely that SEAL Team Six will rappel into the homes of al Shabaab's leaders and take them out. But many of these other factors that were in play are now even stronger than before. Half the work is already done. We don't have to reinvent the wheel. The notion of violent jihad in which more Muslims are killed than any other kind of people is already thoroughly discredited. We don't have to go back to that. Satellite television and the Internet are informing and empowering young Muslims in exciting new ways. And the Arab Spring has produced governments  many of them Islamist governments  who know that  for their own self preservation  they need to take on the extremists in their midsts. We don't need to persuade them  but we do need to help them  because they haven't really come to this place before. The good news  again  is that a lot of the things they need we already have  and we are very good at giving  economic assistance  not just money  but expertise  technology  knowhow  private investment  fair terms of trade  medicine  education  technical support for training for their police forces to become more effective  for their anti terror forces to become more efficient. We've got plenty of these things. Some of the other things that they need we're not very good at giving. Maybe nobody is. Time  patience  subtlety  understanding    these are harder to give. I live in New York now. Just this week  posters have gone up in subway stations in New York that describe jihad as savage. But in all the many years that I have covered the Middle East  I have never been as optimistic as I am today that the gap between the Muslim world and the West is narrowing fast  and one of the many reasons for my optimism is that  because I know there are millions  hundreds of millions of people  Muslims like that old imam in Tunis  who are reclaiming this word and restoring to its original  beautiful purpose. Bin Laden is dead. Bin Ladenism has been defeated. His definition of jihad can now be expunged. To that jihad we can say   Goodbye. Good riddance.  To the real jihad we can say   Welcome back. Good luck.  Thank you.  Applause  So I grew up in Limpopo  on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga  a little town called Motetema. Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather  and growing up in these tough situations  at the age of     I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter  and we were sunbathing. The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter. So as we were sunbathing  my best friend next to me says   Man  why doesn't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don't have to bathe   And I sat  and I was like   Man  I would buy that  eh   So I went home  and I did a little research  and I found some very shocking statistics. Over  .  billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation. Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa  and five million of them are in South Africa. Various diseases thrive in this environment  the most drastic of which is called trachoma. Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye. Multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind. The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year. The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma  all you have to do is wash your face  no medicine  no pills  no injections. So after seeing these shocking statistics  I thought to myself   Okay  even if I'm not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don't want to bathe  I at least need to do it to try to save the world.   Laughter  So with my trusty little steed  my Nokia      cell phone    I didn't have a laptop  I didn't have Internet much  except for the    rand an hour Internet cafe   I did research on Wikipedia  on Google  about lotions  creams  the compositions  the melting points  the toxicities    I did high school science    and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper  and it looked like the KFC special spice  you know  So I was like  okay  so we've got the formula ready. Now we need to get this thing into practice. Fast forward four years later  after having written a    page business plan on the cell phone  having written my patent on the cell phone  I'm the youngest patent holder in the country  and     No more bathing      I can't say any more than that.  Laughter  I had invented DryBath  the world's first bath substituting lotion. You literally put it on your skin  and you don't have to bathe. So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had  I went to university  met a few people  got it into practice  and we have a fully functioning product that's ready to go to the market. It's actually available on the market. So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available. One of the things we learned was that poor communities don't buy products in bulk. They buy products on demand. A person in Alex doesn't buy a box of cigarettes. They buy one cigarette each day  even though it's more expensive. So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets. You just snap them in half  and you squeeze it out. And the cool part is  one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand. After creating that model  we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product. We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath.  Laughter  At least once a week. Anyway  we realized that we could save    million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath  and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas  two hours more for school  two hours more for homework  two hours more to just be a kid. After seeing that global impact  we narrowed it down to our key value proposition  which was cleanliness and convenience. DryBath is a rich man's convenience and a poor man's lifesaver. Having put the product into practice  we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market  and one question I have for the audience today is  on the gravel roads of Limpopo  with an allowance of    rand a week  I came up with a way for the world not to bathe. What's stopping you   Applause  I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet. And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process  last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world. I'm also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world  the first African to get that accolade  and one thing that really puzzles me is  I did all of this just because I didn't want to bathe. Thank you. B.J. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future. He had a vision. When he got out  he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight  and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision. He'd spent        dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars.  Laughter  It was my first week in federal prison  and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV. In fact  it was teeming with smart  ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the CEOs who had wined and dined me six months earlier when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate. Now     percent of the guys that I was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside  but when they talked about what they did  they talked about it in a different jargon  but the business concepts that they talked about weren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton  promotional incentives  you never charge a first time user  focus grouping new product launches  territorial expansion. But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days. For the most part  everyone was just trying to survive. It's a lot harder than you might think. Contrary to what most people think  people don't pay  taxpayers don't pay  for your life when you're in prison. You've got to pay for your own life. You've got to pay for your soap  your deodorant  toothbrush  toothpaste  all of it. And it's hard for a couple of reasons. First  everything's marked up    to    percent from what you'd pay on the street  and second  you don't make a lot of money. I unloaded trucks. That was my full time job  unloading trucks at a food warehouse  for   .    not an hour  but per month. So how do you survive  Well  you learn to hustle  all kinds of hustles. There's legal hustles. You pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency. You charge another inmate to clean his cell. There's sort of illegal hustles  like you run a barbershop out of your cell. There's pretty illegal hustles  You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell. And there's very illegal hustles  which you smuggle in  you get smuggled in  drugs  pornography  cell phones  and just as in the outer world  there's a risk reward tradeoff  so the riskier the enterprise  the more profitable it can potentially be. You want a cigarette in prison  Three to five dollars. You want an old fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head  Three hundred bucks. You want a dirty magazine  Well  it can be as much as       dollars. So as you can probably tell  one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity. Whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse  sculpting people's hair with toenail clippers  or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs  prisoners learn how to make do with less  and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they've learned to the outside and start restaurants  barber shops  personal training businesses. But there's no training  nothing to prepare them for that  no rehabilitation at all in prison  no one to help them write a business plan  figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises  no access to the Internet  even. And then  when they come out  most states don't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background. So none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex offenders re offend within five years. Look  I lied to the Feds. I lost a year of my life from it. But when I came out  I vowed that I was going to do whatever I could to make sure that guys like the ones I was locked up with didn't have to waste any more of their life than they already had. So I hope that you'll think about helping in some way. The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons  because if we don't  they're not going to learn any new skills that's going to help them  and they'll be right back. All they'll learn on the inside is new hustles. Thank you.  Applause  I'd like to show you a video of some of the models I work with. They're all the perfect size  and they don't have an ounce of fat. Did I mention they're gorgeous  And they're scientific models   Laughs  As you might have guessed  I'm a tissue engineer  and this is a video of some of the beating heart that I've engineered in the lab. And one day we hope that these tissues can serve as replacement parts for the human body. But what I'm going to tell you about today is how these tissues make awesome models. Well  let's think about the drug screening process for a moment. You go from drug formulation  lab testing  animal testing  and then clinical trials  which you might call human testing  before the drugs get to market. It costs a lot of money  a lot of time  and sometimes  even when a drug hits the market  it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people. And the later it fails  the worse the consequences. It all boils down to two issues. One  humans are not rats  and two  despite our incredible similarities to one another  actually those tiny differences between you and I have huge impacts with how we metabolize drugs and how those drugs affect us. So what if we had better models in the lab that could not only mimic us better than rats but also reflect our diversity  Let's see how we can do it with tissue engineering. One of the key technologies that's really important is what's called induced pluripotent stem cells. They were developed in Japan pretty recently. Okay  induced pluripotent stem cells. They're a lot like embryonic stem cells except without the controversy. We induce cells  okay  say  skin cells  by adding a few genes to them  culturing them  and then harvesting them. So they're skin cells that can be tricked  kind of like cellular amnesia  into an embryonic state. So without the controversy  that's cool thing number one. Cool thing number two  you can grow any type of tissue out of them  brain  heart  liver  you get the picture  but out of your cells. So we can make a model of your heart  your brain on a chip. Generating tissues of predictable density and behavior is the second piece  and will be really key towards getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery. And this is a schematic of a bioreactor we're developing in our lab to help engineer tissues in a more modular  scalable way. Going forward  imagine a massively parallel version of this with thousands of pieces of human tissue. It would be like having a clinical trial on a chip. But another thing about these induced pluripotent stem cells is that if we take some skin cells  let's say  from people with a genetic disease and we engineer tissues out of them  we can actually use tissue engineering techniques to generate models of those diseases in the lab. Here's an example from Kevin Eggan's lab at Harvard. He generated neurons from these induced pluripotent stem cells from patients who have Lou Gehrig's Disease  and he differentiated them into neurons  and what's amazing is that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease. So with disease models like these  we can fight back faster than ever before and understand the disease better than ever before  and maybe discover drugs even faster. This is another example of patient specific stem cells that were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa. This is a degeneration of the retina. It's a disease that runs in my family  and we really hope that cells like these will help us find a cure. So some people think that these models sound well and good  but ask   Well  are these really as good as the rat   The rat is an entire organism  after all  with interacting networks of organs. A drug for the heart can get metabolized in the liver  and some of the byproducts may be stored in the fat. Don't you miss all that with these tissue engineered models  Well  this is another trend in the field. By combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics  the field is actually evolving towards just that  a model of the entire ecosystem of the body  complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test how a drug you might take for your blood pressure might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart. These systems are really hard to build  but we're just starting to be able to get there  and so  watch out. But that's not even all of it  because once a drug is approved  tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments. This is an example that you might care about someday  and I hope you never do  because imagine if you ever get that call that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer. Wouldn't you rather test to see if those cancer drugs you're going to take are going to work on your cancer  This is an example from Karen Burg's lab  where they're using inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells and study its progressions and treatments. And some of our colleagues at Tufts are mixing models like these with tissue engineered bone to see how cancer might spread from one part of the body to the next  and you can imagine those kinds of multi tissue chips to be the next generation of these kinds of studies. And so thinking about the models that we've just discussed  you can see  going forward  that tissue engineering is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening at every single step of the path  disease models making for better drug formulations  massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing  reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials  and individualized therapies that disrupt what we even consider to be a market at all. Essentially  we're dramatically speeding up that feedback between developing a molecule and learning about how it acts in the human body. Our process for doing this is essentially transforming biotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology  helping us discover and evaluate drugs faster  more cheaply and more effectively. It gives new meaning to models against animal testing  doesn't it  Thank you.  Applause   My Air Jordans cost a hundred with tax. My suede Starters jacket says Raiders on the back. I'm stylin'  smilin'  lookin' real mean  because it ain't about being heard  just being seen. My leather Adidas baseball cap matches my fake Gucci backpack.  Laughter  Ain't nobody who looks as good as me  but this costs money  it sure ain't free  and I gots no job  no money at all  but it's easy to steal all this from the mall. Parents say I shouldn't  but I knows I should. Got to do what I can to make sure I look good  and the reason I have to look real good  well  to tell you the truth  man  I don't know why. Guess it makes me feel special inside. When I'm wearing fresh gear I don't have to hide  and I really must get some new gear soon or my ego will pop like a    cent balloon. But security is tight at all the shops. Every day there are more and more cops. My crew is laughing at me because I'm wearing old gear. School's almost over. Summer is near. And I'm sportin' torn Jordans. I need something new. Only one thing left to do. Cut school Friday  catch the subway downtown  check out my victims hangin' around. Maybe I'll get lucky and find easy prey. Got to get some new gear. There's no other way. I'm ready and willing. I'm packing my gun. This is serious business. This ain't no fun. And I can't have my posse laughin' at me. I'mma cop something dope  just wait  you'll see. Come out of the station  West  th near the park  brothers shooting hoops and someone remarks  'Hey homes  where you get them Nik's ' I says to myself  'Yeah. I likes 'em  I likes.' They were Q tip white  bright and blinding my eyes. The red emblem of Michael looked as if it could fly. Not one spot of dirt. The Airs were brand new. Had my pistol and knew just what to do. Waited until it was just the right time  followed him very closely behind. He made a left turn on Houston  I pulled out my gun  and I said  'Gimme them Jordans ' And the punk tried to run. Took off fast  didn't get far. I fired 'Pow ' Fool fell between two parked cars. He was coughing  crying  blood spilled on the street. And I snatched them Air Jordans off of his feet. While laying there dying  all he could say was   Please man  don't take my Air Jordans away.  You'd think he'd be worried about staying alive. As I took off with his sneakers  there was tears in his eyes. Very next day  I bopped into school with my brand new Air Jordans  man  I was cool. I killed to get 'em  but hey  I don't care  because now I needs a new jacket to wear.  Thank you.  Applause  For the last    years that I have been performing  all I ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world. See  it wasn't enough for me to write a book. It wasn't enough for me to join a slam competition  and while those things hold weight  it wasn't the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad. The hunger and thirst was  and still remains  How do I get people who hate poetry to love me  Because I'm an extension of my work  and if they love me  then they will love my work  and if they love my work  then they will love poetry  and if they love poetry  then I will have done my job  which is to transcend it to the world. And in       I found the answer in principles in a master spoken word artist named Reg E. Gaines  who wrote the famous poem   Please Don't Take My Air Jordans.  And I followed this guy everywhere until I had him in the room  and I read him one of my pieces  and you know what he told me   Yo' wack. You know what the problem is with you  homie  You don't read other people's poetry  and you don't got any subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration.   Laughter  Now he kept on rambling about poetry and styles and Nuyorican Friday nights. Now I could have quit. I should have quit. I mean  I thought poetry was just self expression. I didn't know you actually have to have creative control. So instead of quitting  I followed him everywhere. When he was writing a Broadway show  I would be outside of the door. I would wake him up at  like       in the morning to ask him who's the best poet. I remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the sea because he told me it was brain food. Then one day I told him   Reg E.  what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration    Laughter  And he handed me a black and white printed out thesis on a poet named Etheridge Knight and the oral nature of poetry  and from that point  Reggie stopped becoming the best to me  because what Etheridge Knight taught me was that I could make my words sound like music  even my small ones  the monosyllables  the ifs  ands  buts  whats  the gangsta in my slang could fall right on the ear  and from then on  I started chasing Etheridge Knight. I wanted to know which poet he read  and I landed on a poem called   Dark Prophecy  Sing of Shine    a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage a poet could ever be  Broadway  baby. And from that point  I learned how to pull the mic away and attack the poetry with my body. But that wasn't the biggest lesson I ever learned. The biggest lesson I learned was many years later when I went to Beverly Hills and I ran into a talent agent who looked at me up and down and said I don't look like I have any experience to be working in this business. And I said to him   Listen  punk fool  you're a failed actor who became an agent  and you know why you failed as an actor  Because people like me took your job. I've traveled all the way from Cleveland and Essex in East New York  took the local   line up to the hookers of Hunt's Point who were in my way on my way to master the art of space  and the one to infinite amount of man  woman and child you can fit in there only so I can push them to the back of the wall with my experience. People have bought tickets to my experience and used them as refrigerator magnets to let them know that the revolution is near  so stock up. I'm so experienced that when you went to a privileged school to learn a Shakespearean sonnet  I was getting those beats kicked and shoved into me. I can master shock of  The Crying Game  with the awe of a child being called an AIDS victim by a bully who didn't know that it was his father who gave it to my mother  and that's a double entendre. I'm so experienced that when you went to the Fell School and all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child in it  that was me  but kicked me out when I was caught teaching the fairy boys how to rob the PATS off a pair of Lee Jeans and bring them to VIM. Let me see Chekhov pull that off. Sanford Meisner was my Uncle Artie yelling silently to himself   Something's always wrong when nothing's always right.  Method acting is nothing but a mixture of multiple personalities  believing your own lies are reality  like in high school cool Kenny telling me he wanted to be a cop. Dude  you go to Riker's Island Academy. I could make David Mamet psychoanalyze my attack on dialogue  Stanislavski be as if he were Bruce Lee kicking your roster of talentless students up and down Crenshaw. So what  your actors studied guerrilla theater at the London Rep  Let me tell you an ancient Chinese Saturday afternoon kung fu secret. Boards don't hit back. You think black entertainers have it hard finding work in this business  I'm a suspicious mulatto  which means I'm too black to be white and too white to be doing it right. Forget the American ghetto. I've cracked stages in Soweto  buried abortion babies in potter's field and still managed to keep a smile on my face  so whatever you curse at me to your caddyshack go for this  go for that assistant when I walk out that door  whatever slander you send my way  your mother. Thank you.  Applause  In       a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane. The Wright Brothers  in the beginning of the last century  had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly. They also had taken out numerous patents on essential parts of the airplane. They were not the only ones. That was common practice in the industry  and those who held patents on airplanes were defending them fiercely and suing competitors left and right. This actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry  and this was at a time that in particular the U.S. government was interested in ramping up the production of military airplanes. So there was a bit of a conflict there. The U.S. government decided to take action  and forced those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of airplanes. So what has this got to do with this  In       Nelson Otwoma  a Kenyan social scientist  discovered he had HIV and needed access to treatment. He was told that a cure did not exist. AIDS  he heard  was lethal  and treatment was not offered. This was at a time that treatment actually existed in rich countries. AIDS had become a chronic disease. People in our countries here in Europe  in North America  were living with HIV  healthy lives. Not so for Nelson. He wasn't rich enough  and not so for his three year old son  who he discovered a year later also had HIV. Nelson decided to become a treatment activist and join up with other groups. In       they were facing a different battle. Prices for ARVs  the drugs needed to treat HIV  cost about         dollars  per patient per year. The patents on those drugs were held by a number of Western pharmaceutical companies that were not necessarily willing to make those patents available. When you have a patent  you can exclude anyone else from making  from producing or making low cost versions  for example  available of those medications. Clearly this led to patent wars breaking out all over the globe. Luckily  those patents did not exist everywhere. There were countries that did not recognize pharmaceutical product patents  such as India  and Indian pharmaceutical companies started to produce so called generic versions  low cost copies of antiretroviral medicines  and make them available in the developing world  and within a year the price had come down from        dollars per patient per year to     dollars per patient per year  and today that same triple pill cocktail is available for    dollars per patient per year  and of course that started to have an enormous effect on the number of people who could afford access to those medicines. Treatment programs became possible  funding became available  and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly. Today  eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs. Thirty four million are infected with HIV. Never has this number been so high  but actually this is good news  because what it means is people stop dying. People who have access to these drugs stop dying. And there's something else. They also stop passing on the virus. This is fairly recent science that has shown that. What that means is we have the tools to break the back of this epidemic. So what's the problem  Well  things have changed. First of all  the rules have changed. Today  all countries are obliged to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least    years. This is as a result of the intellectual property rules of the World Trade Organization. So what India did is no longer possible. Second  the practice of patent holding companies have changed. Here you see the patent practices before the World Trade Organization's rules  before '    before antiretroviral drugs. This is what you see today  and this is in developing countries  so what that means is  unless we do something deliberate and unless we do something now  we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis  because new drugs are developed  new drugs go to market  but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries. So unless we act  unless we do something today  we will soon be faced  with  what some have termed the treatment time bomb. It isn't only the number of drugs that are patented. There's something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away. This shows you a patent landscape. This is the landscape of one medicine. So you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product  unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available  you will probably choose to do something else. Again  deliberate action is needed. So surely if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes  we should be able to do something similar to tackle the HIV AIDS epidemic. And we did. In       UNITAID established the Medicines Patent Pool for HIV. And this is how it works  Patent holders  inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions  but make those patents available to the Medicines Patent Pool. The Medicines Patent Pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents. That can be generic manufacturers. It can also be not for profit drug development agencies  for example. Those manufacturers can then sell those medicines at much lower cost to people who need access to them  to treatment programs that need access to them. They pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders  so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property. There is one key difference with the airplane patent pool. The Medicines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism. The airplane patent holders were not left a choice whether they'd license their patents or not. They were forced to do so. That is something that the Medicines Patent Pool cannot do. It relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and make them available for others to use. Today  Nelson Otwoma is healthy. He has access to antiretroviral drugs. His son will soon be    years old. Nelson is a member of the expert advisory group of the Medicines Patent Pool  and he told me not so long ago   Ellen  we rely in Kenya and in many other countries on the Medicines Patent Pool to make sure that new medicines also become available to us  that new medicines  without delay  become available to us.  And this is no longer fantasy. Already  I'll give you an example. In August of this year  the United States drug agency approved a new four in one AIDS medication. The company  Gilead  that holds the patents  has licensed the intellectual property to the Medicines Patent Pool. The pool is already working today  two months later  with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product can go to market at low cost where and when it is needed. This is unprecedented. This has never been done before. The rule is about a    year delay for a new product to go to market in developing countries  if at all. This has never been seen before. Nelson's expectations are very high  and quite rightly so. He and his son will need access to the next generation of antiretrovirals and the next  throughout their lifetime  so that he and many others in Kenya and other countries can continue to live healthy  active lives. Now we count on the willingness of drug companies to make that happen. We count on those companies that understand that it is in the interest  not only in the interest of the global good  but also in their own interest  to move from conflict to collaboration  and through the Medicines Patent Pool they can make that happen. They can also choose not to do that  but those that go down that road may end up in a similar situation the Wright brothers ended up with early last century  facing forcible measures by government. So they'd better jump now. Thank you.  Applause  I've been a journalist now since I was about     and it's an interesting industry to be in at the moment  because as you all know  there's a huge amount of upheaval going on in media  and most of you probably know this from the business angle  which is that the business model is pretty screwed  and as my grandfather would say  the profits have all been gobbled up by Google. So it's a really interesting time to be a journalist  but the upheaval that I'm interested in is not on the output side. It's on the input side. It's concern with how we get information and how we gather the news. And that's changed  because we've had a huge shift in the balance of power from the news organizations to the audience. And the audience for such a long time was in a position where they didn't have any way of affecting news or making any change. They couldn't really connect. And that's changed irrevocably. My first connection with the news media was in       the BBC had a one day strike. I wasn't happy. I was angry. I couldn't see my cartoons. So I wrote a letter. And it's a very effective way of ending your hate mail   Love Markham  Aged  .  Still works. I'm not sure if I had any impact on the one day strike  but what I do know is that it took them three weeks to get back to me. And that was the round journey. It took that long for anyone to have any impact and get some feedback. And that's changed now because  as journalists  we interact in real time. We're not in a position where the audience is reacting to news. We're reacting to the audience  and we're actually relying on them. They're helping us find the news. They're helping us figure out what is the best angle to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear. So it's a real time thing. It's much quicker. It's happening on a constant basis  and the journalist is always playing catch up. To give an example of how we rely on the audience  on the  th of September in Costa Rica  an earthquake hit. It was a  .  magnitude. It was fairly big. And    seconds is the amount of time it took for it to travel     kilometers to Managua. So the ground shook in Managua    seconds after it hit the epicenter. Thirty seconds later  the first message went onto Twitter  and this was someone saying  temblor   which means earthquake. So    seconds was how long it took for the physical earthquake to travel. Thirty seconds later news of that earthquake had traveled all around the world  instantly. Everyone in the world  hypothetically  had the potential to know that an earthquake was happening in Managua. And that happened because this one person had a documentary instinct  which was to post a status update  which is what we all do now  so if something happens  we put our status update  or we post a photo  we post a video  and it all goes up into the cloud in a constant stream. And what that means is just constant  huge volumes of data going up. It's actually staggering. When you look at the numbers  every minute there are    more hours of video on YouTube. So that's  every second  more than an hour of video gets uploaded. And in photos  Instagram     photos are uploaded to Instagram a second. More than three and a half thousand photos go up onto Facebook. So by the time I'm finished talking here  there'll be     more hours of video on Youtube than there were when I started  and two and a half million more photos on Facebook and Instagram than when I started. So it's an interesting position to be in as a journalist  because we should have access to everything. Any event that happens anywhere in the world  I should be able to know about it pretty much instantaneously  as it happens  for free. And that goes for every single person in this room. The only problem is  when you have that much information  you have to find the good stuff  and that can be incredibly difficult when you're dealing with those volumes. And nowhere was this brought home more than during Hurricane Sandy. So what you had in Hurricane Sandy was a superstorm  the likes of which we hadn't seen for a long time  hitting the iPhone capital of the universe     Laughter     and you got volumes of media like we'd never seen before. And that meant that journalists had to deal with fakes  so we had to deal with old photos that were being reposted. We had to deal with composite images that were merging photos from previous storms. We had to deal with images from films like  The Day After Tomorrow.   Laughter  And we had to deal with images that were so realistic it was nearly difficult to tell if they were real at all. But joking aside  there were images like this one from Instagram which was subjected to a grilling by journalists. They weren't really sure. It was filtered in Instagram. The lighting was questioned. Everything was questioned about it. And it turned out to be true. It was from Avenue C in downtown Manhattan  which was flooded. And the reason that they could tell that it was real was because they could get to the source  and in this case  these guys were New York food bloggers. They were well respected. They were known. So this one wasn't a debunk  it was actually something that they could prove. And that was the job of the journalist. It was filtering all this stuff. And you were  instead of going and finding the information and bringing it back to the reader  you were holding back the stuff that was potentially damaging. And finding the source becomes more and more important    finding the good source    and Twitter is where most journalists now go. It's like the de facto real time newswire  if you know how to use it  because there is so much on Twitter. And a good example of how useful it can be but also how difficult was the Egyptian revolution in     . As a non Arabic speaker  as someone who was looking from the outside  from Dublin  Twitter lists  and lists of good sources  people we could establish were credible  were really important. And how do you build a list like that from scratch  Well  it can be quite difficult  but you have to know what to look for. This visualization was done by an Italian academic. He's called Andr  Pannison  and he basically took the Twitter conversation in Tahrir Square on the day that Hosni Mubarak would eventually resign  and the dots you can see are retweets  so when someone retweets a message  a connection is made between two dots  and the more times that message is retweeted by other people  the more you get to see these nodes  these connections being made. And it's an amazing way of visualizing the conversation  but what you get is hints at who is more interesting and who is worth investigating. And as the conversation grew and grew  it became more and more lively  and eventually you were left with this huge  big  rhythmic pointer of this conversation. You could find the nodes  though  and then you went  and you go   Right  I've got to investigate these people. These are the ones that are obviously making sense. Let's see who they are.  Now in the deluge of information  this is where the real time web gets really interesting for a journalist like myself  because we have more tools than ever to do that kind of investigation. And when you start digging into the sources  you can go further and further than you ever could before. Sometimes you come across a piece of content that is so compelling  you want to use it  you're dying to use it  but you're not     percent sure if you can because you don't know if the source is credible. You don't know if it's a scrape. You don't know if it's a re upload. And you have to do that investigative work. And this video  which I'm going to let run through  was one we discovered a couple of weeks ago. Video  Getting real windy in just a second. Markham Nolan  Okay  so now if you're a news producer  this is something you'd love to run with  because obviously  this is gold. You know  This is a fantastic reaction from someone  very genuine video that they've shot in their back garden. But how do you find if this person  if it's true  if it's faked  or if it's something that's old and that's been reposted  So we set about going to work on this video  and the only thing that we had to go on was the username on the YouTube account. There was only one video posted to that account  and the username was Rita Krill. And we didn't know if Rita existed or if it was a fake name. But we started looking  and we used free Internet tools to do so. The first one was called Spokeo  which allowed us to look for Rita Krills. So we looked all over the U.S. We found them in New York  we found them in Pennsylvania  Nevada and Florida. So we went and we looked for a second free Internet tool called Wolfram Alpha  and we checked the weather reports for the day in which this video had been uploaded  and when we went through all those various cities  we found that in Florida  there were thunderstorms and rain on the day. So we went to the white pages  and we found  we looked through the Rita Krills in the phonebook  and we looked through a couple of different addresses  and that took us to Google Maps  where we found a house. And we found a house with a swimming pool that looked remarkably like Rita's. So we went back to the video  and we had to look for clues that we could cross reference. So if you look in the video  there's the big umbrella  there's a white lilo in the pool  there are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool  and there's two trees in the background. And we went back to Google Maps  and we looked a little bit closer  and sure enough  there's the white lilo  there are the two trees  there's the umbrella. It's actually folded in this photo. Little bit of trickery. And there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool. So we were able to call Rita  clear the video  make sure that it had been shot  and then our clients were delighted because they were able to run it without being worried. Sometimes the search for truth  though  is a little bit less flippant  and it has much greater consequences. Syria has been really interesting for us  because obviously a lot of the time you're trying to debunk stuff that can be potentially war crime evidence  so this is where YouTube actually becomes the most important repository of information about what's going on in the world. So this video  I'm not going to show you the whole thing  because it's quite gruesome  but you'll hear some of the sounds. This is from Hama. Video   Shouting  And what this video shows  when you watch the whole thing through  is bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck and thrown off a bridge. The allegations were that these guys were Muslim Brotherhood and they were throwing Syrian Army officers' bodies off the bridge  and they were cursing and using blasphemous language  and there were lots of counterclaims about who they were  and whether or not they were what the video said it was. So we talked to some sources in Hama who we had been back and forth with on Twitter  and we asked them about this  and the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify. Three different sources said three different things about the bridge. They said  one  the bridge doesn't exist. Another one said the bridge does exist  but it's not in Hama. It's somewhere else. And the third one said   I think the bridge does exist  but the dam upstream of the bridge was closed  so the river should actually have been dry  so this doesn't make sense.  So that was the only one that gave us a clue. We looked through the video for other clues. We saw the distinctive railings  which we could use. We looked at the curbs. The curbs were throwing shadows south  so we could tell the bridge was running east west across the river. It had black and white curbs. As we looked at the river itself  you could see there's a concrete stone on the west side. There's a cloud of blood. That's blood in the river. So the river is flowing south to north. That's what that tells me. And also  as you look away from the bridge  there's a divot on the left hand side of the bank  and the river narrows. So onto Google Maps we go  and we start looking through literally every single bridge. We go to the dam that we talked about  we start just literally going through every time that road crosses the river  crossing off the bridges that don't match. We're looking for one that crosses east west. And we get to Hama. We get all the way from the dam to Hama and there's no bridge. So we go a bit further. We switch to the satellite view  and we find another bridge  and everything starts to line up. The bridge looks like it's crossing the river east to west. So this could be our bridge. And we zoom right in. We start to see that it's got a median  so it's a two lane bridge. And it's got the black and white curbs that we saw in the video  and as we click through it  you can see someone's uploaded photos to go with the map  which is very handy  so we click into the photos. And the photos start showing us more detail that we can cross reference with the video. The first thing that we see is we see black and white curbing  which is handy because we've seen that before. We see the distinctive railing that we saw the guys throwing the bodies over. And we keep going through it until we're certain that this is our bridge. So what does that tell me  I've got to go back now to my three sources and look at what they told me  the one who said the bridge didn't exist  the one who said the bridge wasn't in Hama  and the one guy who said   Yes  the bridge does exist  but I'm not sure about the water levels.  Number three is looking like the most truthful all of a sudden  and we've been able to find that out using some free Internet tools sitting in a cubicle in an office in Dublin in the space of    minutes. And that's part of the joy of this. Although the web is running like a torrent  there's so much information there that it's incredibly hard to sift and getting harder every day  if you use them intelligently  you can find out incredible information. Given a couple of clues  I could probably find out a lot of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out. But what it tells me is that  at a time when there's more    there's a greater abundance of information than there ever has been  it's harder to filter  we have greater tools. We have free Internet tools that allow us  help us do this kind of investigation. We have algorithms that are smarter than ever before  and computers that are quicker than ever before. But here's the thing. Algorithms are rules. They're binary. They're yes or no  they're black or white. Truth is never binary. Truth is a value. Truth is emotional  it's fluid  and above all  it's human. No matter how quick we get with computers  no matter how much information we have  you'll never be able to remove the human from the truth seeking exercise  because in the end  it is a uniquely human trait. Thanks very much.  Applause  Hello  Doha. Hello  Salaam alaikum. I love coming to Doha. It's such an international place. It feels like the United Nations here. You land at the airport  and you're welcomed by an Indian lady who takes you to Al Maha Services  where you meet a Filipino lady who hands you off to a South African lady who then takes you to a Korean who takes you to a Pakistani guy with the luggage who takes you to the car with a Sri Lankan. You go to the hotel and you check in. There's a Lebanese. Yeah  And then a Swedish guy showed me my room. I said   Where are the Qataris   They said   No  no  it's too hot. They come out later. They're smart.   They know.  And of course  it's growing so fast  sometimes there's growing pains. You know  like sometimes you run into people that you think know the city well  but they don't know it that well. My Indian cab driver showed up at the W  and I asked him to take me to the Sheraton  and he said   No problem  sir.  And then we sat there for two minutes. I said   What's wrong   He said   One problem  sir.  I said   What   He goes   Where is it   I go   You're the driver  you should know.  He goes   No  I just arrived  sir.  I go   You just arrived at the W    No  I just arrived in Doha  sir.   I was on my way home from the airport  I got a job. I'm working already.  He goes   Sir  why don't you drive    I don't know where we're going.   Neither do I. It will be an adventure  sir.  The Middle East has been an adventure the past couple of years. It is going crazy with the Arab Spring and revolution and all this. Are there any Lebanese here tonight  by applause  Lebanese  yeah. The Middle East is going crazy. You know the Middle East is going crazy when Lebanon is the most peaceful place in the region. Who would have thought  Oh my gosh. No  there's serious issues in the region. Some people don't want to talk about them. I'm here to talk about them tonight. Ladies and gentlemen of the Middle East  here's a serious issue. When we see each other  when we say hello  how many kisses are we going to do  Every country is different and it's confusing  okay  In Lebanon  they do three. In Egypt  they do two. I was in Lebanon  I got used to three. I went to Egypt. I went to say hello to this one Egyptian guy  I went  one  two. I went for three    He wasn't into it. I told him  I said   No  no  I was just in Lebanon.  He goes   I don't care where you were. You just stay where you are  please.  I went to Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia  they go one  two  and then they stay on the same side  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine                                        Next time you see a Saudi  look closely. They're just a little bit tilted.  Abdul  are you okay    I was saying hello for half an hour. I'll be all right.  Qataris  you guys do the nose to nose. Why is that  Are you too tired to go all the way around   Habibi  it's so hot. Just come here for a second. Say hello. Hello  Habibi. Just don't move. Just stay there  please. I need to rest.  Iranians  sometimes we do two  sometimes we do three. A friend of mine explained to me  before the '   revolution  it was two. After the revolution  three. So with Iranians  you can tell whose side the person is on based on the number of kisses they give you. Yeah  if you go one  two  three     I can't believe you support this regime    With your three kisses.  But no  guys  really  it is exciting to be here  and like I said  you guys are doing a lot culturally  you know  and it's amazing  and it helps change the image of the Middle East in the West. A lot of Americans don't know a lot about us  about the Middle East. I'm Iranian and American. I'm there. I know  I've traveled here. There's so much  we laugh  right  People don't know we laugh. When I did the Axis of Evil comedy tour  it came out on Comedy Central  I went online to see what people were saying. I ended up on a conservative website. One guy wrote another guy. He said   I never knew these people laughed.  Think about it. You never see us laughing in American film or television  right  Maybe like an evil laugh   Wuhahaha.   I will kill you in the name of Allah  wuhahahahaha.  But never like   Ha ha ha ha la.  We like to laugh. We like to celebrate life. And I wish more Americans would travel here. I always encourage my friends   Travel  see the Middle East  there's so much to see  so many good people.  And it's vice versa  and it helps stop problems of misunderstanding and stereotypes from happening. For example  I don't know if you heard about this  a little while ago in the US  there was a Muslim family walking down the aisle of an airplane  talking about the safest place to sit on the plane. Some passengers overheard them  somehow misconstrued that as terrorist talk  got them kicked off the plane. It was a family  a mother  father  child  talking about the seating. As a Middle Eastern male  I know there's certain things I'm not supposed to say on an airplane in the US  right  I'm not supposed to be walking down the aisle  and be like   Hi  Jack.  That's not cool. Even if I'm there with my friend named Jack  I say   Greetings  Jack. Salutations  Jack.  Never  Hi  Jack.  But now  apparently we can't even talk about the safest place to sit on an airplane. So my advice to all my Middle Eastern friends and Muslim friends and anyone who looks Middle Eastern or Muslim  so to  you know  Indians  and Latinos  everyone  if you're brown    Here's my advice to my brown friends. The next time you're on an airplane in the US  just speak your mother tongue. That way no one knows what you're saying. Life goes on. Granted  some mother tongues might sound a little threatening to the average American. If you're walking down the aisle speaking Arabic  you might freak them out    They might say   What's he talking about   The key  to my Arab brothers and sisters  is to throw in random good words to put people at ease as you're walking down the aisle. Just as you're walking down    Strawberry  Rainbow  Tutti Frutti   I think he's going to hijack the plane with some ice cream.  Thank you very much. Have a good night. Thank you  TED. This is poo  and what I want to do today is share my passion for poo with you  which might be quite difficult  but I think what you might find more fascinating is the way these small animals deal with poo. So this animal here has got a brain about the size of a grain of rice  and yet it can do things that you and I couldn't possibly entertain the idea of doing. And basically it's all evolved to handle its food source  which is dung. So the question is  where do we start this story  And it seems appropriate to start at the end  because this is a waste product that comes out of other animals  but it still contains nutrients and there are sufficient nutrients in there for dung beetles basically to make a living  and so dung beetles eat dung  and their larvae are also dung feeders. They are grown completely in a ball of dung. Within South Africa  we've got about     species of dung beetles  in Africa we've got       species of dung beetles  and in the world we have about       species of dung beetles. So  according to dung beetles  dung is pretty good. Unless you're prepared to get dung under your fingernails and root through the dung itself  you'll never see    percent of the dung beetle species  because they go directly into the dung  straight down below it  and then they shuttle back and forth between the dung at the soil surface and a nest they make underground. So the question is  how do they deal with this material  And most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort. Ten percent of the species actually make a ball  and this ball they roll away from the dung source  usually bury it at a remote place away from the dung source  and they have a very particular behavior by which they are able to roll their balls. So this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball. You can see it's a male because he's got a little hair on the back of his legs there  and he's clearly very pleased about what he's sitting on there. And then he's about to become a victim of a vicious smash and grab.  Laughter  And this is a clear indication that this is a valuable resource. And so valuable resources have to be looked after and guarded in a particular way  and we think the reason they roll the balls away is because of this  because of the competition that is involved in getting hold of that dung. So this dung pat was actually    well  it was a dung pat    minutes before this photograph was taken  and we think it's the intense competition that makes the beetles so well adapted to rolling balls of dung. So what you've got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the African veld. Its head is down. It's walking backwards. It's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction  and at the same time it's got to deal with the heat. This is Africa. It's hot. So what I want to share with you now are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues have used to investigate how dung beetles deal with these problems. So watch this beetle  and there's two things that I would like you to be aware of. The first is how it deals with this obstacle that we've put in its way. See  look  it does a little dance  and then it carries on in exactly the same direction that it took in the first place. A little dance  and then heads off in a particular direction. So clearly this animal knows where it's going and it knows where it wants to go  and that's a very  very important thing  because if you think about it  you're at the dung pile  you've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else  and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line. So we gave them some more tasks to deal with  and what we did here is we turned the world under their feet. And watch its response. So this animal has actually had the whole world turned under its feet. It's turned by    degrees. But it doesn't flinch. It knows exactly where it wants to go  and it heads off in that particular direction. So our next question then was  how are they doing this  What are they doing  And there was a cue that was available to us. It was that every now and then they'd climb on top of the ball and they'd take a look at the world around them. And what do you think they could be looking at as they climb on top of the ball  What are the obvious cues that this animal could use to direct its movement  And the most obvious one is to look at the sky  and so we thought  now what could they be looking at in the sky  And the obvious thing to look at is the sun. So a classic experiment here  in that what we did was we moved the sun. What we're going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position. And look at what the beetle does. It does a little double dance  and then it heads back in exactly the same direction it went in the first place. What happens now  So clearly they're looking at the sun. The sun is a very important cue in the sky for them. The thing is the sun is not always available to you  because at sunset it disappears below the horizon. What is happening in the sky here is that there's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky that you and I can't see. It's the way our eyes are built. But the sun is at the horizon over here and we know that when the sun is at the horizon  say it's over on this side  there is a north south  a huge pathway across the sky of polarized light that we can't see that the beetles can see. So how do we test that  Well  that's easy. What we do is we get a great big polarization filter  pop the beetle underneath it  and the filter is at right angles to the polarization pattern of the sky. The beetle comes out from underneath the filter and it does a right hand turn  because it comes back under the sky that it was originally orientated to and then reorientates itself back to the direction it was originally going in. So obviously beetles can see polarized light. Okay  so what we've got so far is  what are beetles doing  They're rolling balls. How are they doing it  Well  they're rolling them in a straight line. How are they maintaining it in a particular straight line  Well  they're looking at celestial cues in the sky  some of which you and I can't see. But how do they pick up those celestial cues  That was what was of interest to us next. And it was this particular little behavior  the dance  that we thought was important  because look  it takes a pause every now and then  and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in. So what are they doing when they do this dance  How far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves  And in this experiment here  what we did was we forced them into a channel  and you can see he wasn't particularly forced into this particular channel  and we gradually displaced the beetle by     degrees until this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite direction that it wanted to go in  in the first place. And let's see what his reaction is as he's headed through    degrees here  and now he's going to    when he ends up down here  he's going to be     degrees in the wrong direction. And see what his response is. He does a little dance  he turns around  and heads back in this. He knows exactly where he's going. He knows exactly what the problem is  and he knows exactly how to deal with it  and the dance is this transition behavior that allows them to reorientate themselves. So that's the dance  but after spending many years sitting in the African bush watching dung beetles on nice hot days  we noticed that there was another behavior associated with the dance behavior. Every now and then  when they climb on top of the ball  they wipe their face. And you see him do it again. Now we thought  now what could be going on here  Clearly the ground is very hot  and when the ground is hot  they dance more often  and when they do this particular dance  they wipe the bottom of their face. And we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior. We thought that maybe what they're doing is trying to get off the hot soil and also spitting onto their face to cool their head down. So what we did was design a couple of arenas. one was hot  one was cold. We shaded this one. We left that one hot. And then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera. So what you're looking at here is a heat image of the system  and what you can see here emerging from the poo is a cool dung ball. So the truth is  if you look at the temperature over here  dung is cool.  Laughter  So all we're interested in here is comparing the temperature of the beetle against the background. So the background here is around about    degrees centigrade. The beetle itself and the ball are probably around about    to    degrees centigrade  so this is a great big ball of ice cream that this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld. It isn't climbing. It isn't dancing  because its body temperature is actually relatively low. It's about the same as yours and mine. And what's of interest here is that little brain is quite cool. But if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment  look at the temperature of the soil. It's up around    to    degrees centigrade. Watch how often the beetle dances. And look at its front legs. They're roaringly hot. So the ball leaves a little thermal shadow  and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face  and all the time it's trying to cool itself down  we think  and avoid the hot sand that it's walking across. And what we did then was put little boots on these legs  because this was a way to test if the legs were involved in sensing the temperature of the soil. And if you look over here  with boots they climb onto the ball far less often when they had no boots on. So we described these as cool boots. It was a dental compound that we used to make these boots. And we also cooled down the dung ball  so we were able to put the ball in the fridge  gave them a nice cool dung ball  and they climbed onto that ball far less often than when they had a hot ball. So this is called stilting. It's a thermal behavior that you and I do if we cross the beach  we jump onto a towel  somebody has this towel     Sorry  I've jumped onto your towel.     and then you scuttle across onto somebody else's towel  and that way you don't burn your feet. And that's exactly what the beetles are doing here. However  there's one more story I'd like to share with you  and that's this particular species. It's from a genus called Pachysoma. There are    species in the genus  and they have a particular behavior that I think you will find interesting. This is a dung beetle. Watch what he's doing. Can you spot the difference  They don't normally go this slowly. It's in slow motion. but it's walking forwards  and it's actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it. This is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior. There's one more interesting aspect of this dung beetle's behavior that we found quite fascinating  and that's that it forages and provisions a nest. So watch this individual here  and what he's trying to do is set up a nest. And he doesn't like this first position  but he comes up with a second position  and about    minutes later  that nest is finished  and he heads off to forage and provision at a pile of dry dung pellets. And what I want you to notice is the outward path compared to the homeward path  and compare the two. And by and large  you'll see that the homeward path is far more direct than the outward path. On the outward path  he's always on the lookout for a new blob of dung. On the way home  he knows where home is  and he wants to go straight to it. The important thing here is that this is not a one way trip  as in most dung beetles. The trip here is repeated back and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site. And watch  you're going to see another South African crime taking place right now.  Laughter  And his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets. So what we're looking at here is a behavior called path integration. And what's taking place is that the beetle has got a home spot  it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food  and then when it finds food  it heads straight home. It knows exactly where its home is. Now there's two ways it could be doing that  and we can test that by displacing the beetle to a new position when it's at the foraging site. If it's using landmarks  it will find its home. If it is using something called path integration  it will not find its home. It will arrive at the wrong spot  and what it's doing here if it's using path integration is it's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction. It knows the bearing home  and it knows it should be in that direction. If you displace it  it ends up in the wrong place. So let's see what happens when we put this beetle to the test with a similar experiment. So here's our cunning experimenter. He displaces the beetle  and now we have to see what is going to take place. What we've got is a burrow. That's where the forage was. The forage has been displaced to a new position. If he's using landmark orientation  he should be able to find the burrow  because he'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it. If he's using path integration  then it should end up in the wrong spot over here. So let's watch what happens when we put the beetle through the whole test. So there he is there. He's about to head home  and look what happens. Shame. It hasn't a clue. It starts to search for its house in the right distance away from the food  but it is clearly completely lost. So we know now that this animal uses path integration to find its way around  and the callous experimenter leads it top left and leaves it.  Laughter  So what we're looking at here are a group of animals that use a compass  and they use the sun as a compass to find their way around  and they have some sort of system for measuring that distance  and we know that these species here actually count the steps. That's what they use as an odometer  a step counting system  to find their way back home. We don't know yet what dung beetles use. So what have we learned from these animals with a brain that's the size of a grain of rice  Well  we know that they can roll balls in a straight line using celestial cues. We know that the dance behavior is an orientation behavior and it's also a thermoregulation behavior  and we also know that they use a path integration system for finding their way home. So for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substance we can actually learn an awful lot from these things doing behaviors that you and I couldn't possibly do. Thank you.  Applause  I essentially drag sledges for a living  so it doesn't take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually  but I'm going to read this question from an interview earlier this year   Philosophically  does the constant supply of information steal our ability to imagine or replace our dreams of achieving  After all  if it is being done somewhere by someone  and we can participate virtually  then why bother leaving the house   I'm usually introduced as a polar explorer. I'm not sure that's the most progressive or   st century of job titles  but I've spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle  so I get out of the house a fair bit. And in my nature  I guess  I am a doer of things more than I am a spectator or a contemplator of things  and it's that dichotomy  the gulf between ideas and action that I'm going to try and explore briefly. The pithiest answer to the question  why   that's been dogging me for the last    years was credited certainly to this chap  the rakish looking gentleman standing at the back  second from the left  George Lee Mallory. Many of you will know his name. In      he was last seen disappearing into the clouds near the summit of Mt. Everest. He may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest  more than    years before Edmund Hillary. No one knows if he got to the top. It's still a mystery. But he was credited with coining the phrase   Because it's there.  Now I'm not actually sure that he did say that. There's very little evidence to suggest it  but what he did say is actually far nicer  and again  I've printed this. I'm going to read it out.  The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this  What is the use of climbing Mt. Everest  And my answer must at once be  it is no use. There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever. Oh  we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes  and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation  but otherwise nothing will come of it. We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver  and not a gem  nor any coal or iron. We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food. So it is no use. If you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it  that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward  then you won't see why we go. What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy  and joy  after all  is the end of life. We don't live to eat and make money. We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life. That is what life means  and that is what life is for.  Mallory's argument that leaving the house  embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun  however  doesn't tally that neatly with my own experience. The furthest I've ever got away from my front door was in the spring of     . I still don't know exactly what came over me  but my plan was to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean. I planned essentially to walk from the north coast of Russia to the North Pole  and then to carry on to the north coast of Canada. No one had ever done this. I was    at the time. A lot of experts were saying it was impossible  and my mum certainly wasn't very keen on the idea. The journey from a small weather station on the north coast of Siberia up to my final starting point  the edge of the pack ice  the coast of the Arctic Ocean  took about five hours  and if anyone watched fearless Felix Baumgartner going up  rather than just coming down  you'll appreciate the sense of apprehension  as I sat in a helicopter thundering north  and the sense  I think if anything  of impending doom. I sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into. There was a bit of fun  a bit of joy. I was   . I remember sitting there looking down at my sledge. I had my skis ready to go  I had a satellite phone  a pump action shotgun in case I was attacked by a polar bear. I remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter. We were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn  and part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne and Wilfred Thesiger. Part of me felt quite proud of myself  but mostly I was just utterly terrified. And that journey lasted    weeks     days. I didn't see anyone else. We took this photo next to the helicopter. Beyond that  I didn't see anyone for    weeks. The North Pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea  so I'm traveling over the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean. NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began. I was dragging     kilos of food and fuel and supplies  about     pounds. The average temperature for the    weeks was minus   . Minus    was the coldest. So again  there wasn't an awful lot of joy or fun to be had. One of the magical things about this journey  however  is that because I'm walking over the sea  over this floating  drifting  shifting crust of ice that's floating on top of the Arctic Ocean is it's an environment that's in a constant state of flux. The ice is always moving  breaking up  drifting around  refreezing  so the scenery that I saw for nearly   months was unique to me. No one else will ever  could ever  possibly see the views  the vistas  that I saw for    weeks. And that  I guess  is probably the finest argument for leaving the house. I can try to tell you what it was like  but you'll never know what it was like  and the more I try to explain that I felt lonely  I was the only human being in  .  million square miles  it was cold  nearly minus    with windchill on a bad day  the more words fall short  and I'm unable to do it justice. And it seems to me  therefore  that the doing  you know  to try to experience  to engage  to endeavor  rather than to watch and to wonder  that's where the real meat of life is to be found  the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days. And I would add a cautionary note here  however. In my experience  there is something addictive about tasting life at the very edge of what's humanly possible. Now I don't just mean in the field of daft macho Edwardian style derring do  but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer  there is something addictive about this  and in my case  I think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from having a crack habit. I can't explain quite how good it is until you've tried it  but it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on  to ruin every relationship I've ever had  so be careful what you wish for. Mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain  and I wonder if that's the case whether there's something in the challenge itself  in the endeavor  and particularly in the big  unfinished  chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us  and in my experience that's certainly the case. There is one unfinished challenge that's been calling out to me for most of my adult life. Many of you will know the story. This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team. Scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the South Pole. No one knew what was there. It was utterly unmapped at the time. We knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of Antarctica. Scott  as many of you will know  was beaten to it by Roald Amundsen and his Norwegian team  who used dogs and dogsleds. Scott's team were on foot  all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges  and they arrived at the pole to find the Norwegian flag already there  I'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized. All five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey. There is a sort of misconception nowadays that it's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure. When I talk about Antarctica  people often say   Hasn't  you know  that's interesting  hasn't that Blue Peter presenter just done it on a bike   Or   That's nice. You know  my grandmother's going on a cruise to Antarctica next year. You know. Is there a chance you'll see her there   But Scott's journey remains unfinished. No one has ever walked from the very coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again. It is  arguably  the most audacious endeavor of that Edwardian golden age of exploration  and it seemed to me high time  given everything we have figured out in the century since from scurvy to solar panels  that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job. So that's precisely what I'm setting out to do. This time next year  in October  I'm leading a team of three. It will take us about four months to make this return journey. That's the scale. The red line is obviously halfway to the pole. We have to turn around and come back again. I'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting. You'll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before. And it'll also be a four month chance for me to finally come up with a pithy answer to the question   Why   And our lives today are safer and more comfortable than they have ever been. There certainly isn't much call for explorers nowadays. My career advisor at school never mentioned it as an option. If I wanted to know  for example  how many stars were in the Milky Way  how old those giant heads on Easter Island were  most of you could find that out right now without even standing up. And yet  if I've learned anything in nearly    years now of dragging heavy things around cold places  it is that true  real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge  from stepping away from what's comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown. In life  we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to  and I think metaphorically speaking  at least  we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often  if only we could summon up the courage. I certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what's outside. Thank you very much. Twelve years ago  I founded Zipcar. Zipcar buys cars and parks them throughout dense metropolitan areas for people to use  by the hour and by the day  instead of owning their own cars. Each Zipcar replaces    personal cars  and each driver drives about    percent less because they're now paying the full cost  all at once  in real time. But what Zipcar really did was make sharing the norm. Now  a decade later  it's really time to push the envelope a little bit  and so a couple years ago I moved to Paris with my husband and youngest child  and we launched Buzzcar a year ago. Buzzcar lets people rent out their own cars to their friends and neighbors. Instead of investing in a car  we invest in a community. We bring the power of a corporation to individuals who add their cars to the network. Some people call this peer to peer. This does express the humanity of what's going on  and the personal relationships  but that is also like saying that it's the same thing as a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting. That's peer to peer. It's like saying yard sales are the same thing as eBay  or craft fairs are the same thing as Etsy. But what's really happening is that we've got the power of a free and open Internet  and on top of that we're putting a platform for participation  and the peers are now in partnership with the company  creating shared value on shared values  and each strengthening the other  and doing what the other can't do. I call this Peers  Inc. The incorporated side  the company  is doing things that it does really well. What does it do really well  It creates economies of scale  significant and long term resource investment  the expertise of many different kinds of people and different kinds of minds  and for individuals  consumers  it's bringing the standards  rules and recourse that we really want as consumers  and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise  and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation. Peers are giving and doing things that are incredibly expensive for companies to do. What do they bring  They bring this fabulous diversity  expensive for companies. And what does that deliver  It delivers localization and customization  specialization  and all of this aspect about social networks and how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there  It's natural for me. Me and my friends  I can connect to them easily. And it also delivers really fabulous innovation  and I'll talk about that later. So we have the peers that are providing the services and the product  and the company that's doing the stuff that companies do. The two of these are delivering the best of both worlds. Some of my favorite examples  in transportation  Carpooling.com. Ten years old  three and a half million people have joined up  and a million rides are shared every day. It's a phenomenal thing. It's the equivalent of       TGV trains  and just think  they didn't have to lay a track or buy a car. This is all happening with excess capacity. And it's not just with transportation  my love  but of course in other realms. Here's Fiverr.com. I met these founders just weeks after they had launched  and now  in two years  what would you do for five dollars  Seven hundred and fifty thousand gigs are now posted after two years  what people would do for five dollars. And not just easy things that anyone can do. This Peers  Inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm. TopCoder has         engineers who are delivering complex design and engineering services. When I talked to their CEO  he had this great line. He said   We have a community that owns its own company.  And then my all time favorite  Etsy. Etsy is providing goods that people make themselves and they're selling it in a marketplace. It just celebrated its seventh anniversary  and after seven years  last year it delivered     million dollars' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects. I know you guys out there who are businesspeople  are thinking   Oh my God  I want to build one of those. I see this incredible speed and scale. You mean all I have to do is build a platform and all these people are going to put their stuff on top and I sit back and roll it in   Building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do. I think of the difference of Google Video versus YouTube. Who would have thought that two young guys and a start up would beat out Google Video  Why  I actually have no idea why. I didn't talk to them. But I'm thinking  you know  they probably had the  share  button a little bit brighter and to the right  and so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides that are always participating on these networks. So I actually know a lot about building a peer platform now  and a Peers  Inc. company  because I've spent the last two years doing that in Paris. So let me take you back how it's so incredibly different building Buzzcar than it was building Zipcar  because now every single thing we do has these two different bodies that I have to be thinking about  the owners who are going to provide the cars and the drivers who are going to rent them. Every single decision  I have to think about what is right for both sides. There are many  many examples and I'll give you one that is not my favorite example  insurance. It took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right. Hours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative  they'd never thought of it before. Way too much money  I just can't even go there  with lawyers  trying to figure out how this is different  who's responsible to whom  and the result was that we were able to provide owners protection for their own driving records and their own history. The cars are completely insured during the rental  and it gives drivers what they need  and what do they need  They need a low deductible  and    hour roadside assistance. So this was a trick to get these two sides. So now I want to take you to the moment of    When you're an entrepreneur  and you've started a new company  there's the  here's all the stuff we do beforehand  and then the service launches. What happens  So all those months of work  they come into play. Last June    we launched. It was an exciting moment. And all the owners are adding their cars. It's really exciting. All the drivers are becoming members. It's excellent. The reservations start coming in  and here  owners who were getting text messages and emails that said   Hey  Joe wants to rent your car for the weekend. You can earn    euros. Isn't that great  Yes or no   No reply. Like  a huge proportion of them couldn't be bothered after they had just started  they just signed up  to reply. So I thought   Duh  Robin  this is the difference between industrial production and peer production.  Industrial production  the whole point of industrial production is to provide a standardized  exact service model that is consistent every single time  and I'm really thankful that my smartphone is made using industrial production. And Zipcar provides a very nice  consistent service that works fabulously. But what does peer production do  Peer production is this completely different way of doing things  and you have a big quality range  and so eBay  cleverly  the first peer production  Peer  Inc. company  I'd say  they figured out early on  we need to have ratings and commentaries and all that yucky side stuff. We can flag that and we can put it to the side  and people who are buyers and consumers don't have to deal with it. So going back  this is my look of excitement and joy  because all this stuff that I'd also been hoping for actually really did happen  and what's that  That is the diversity of what's going on. You have these different fabulous owners and their different cars  different prices  different locations.  Laughter  They dress differently  and they look different  and  really  I love these photos every time I look at them. Cool guys  excited guys  and here is Selma  who    I love this driver. And after a year  we have       cars that are parked across France and       people who are members and eager to drive them. This would not be possible to do that in economic fashion for a traditional company. Back to this spectrum. So what's happening is  we had the yuck side  but we actually had this real wow side. And I can tell you two great stories. A driver was telling me that they went to rent a car to go up the coast of France and the owner gave it to them  and said   You know what  here's where the cliffs are  and here's all the beaches  and this is my best beach  and this is where the best fish restaurant is.  And the peers also become  peers and owners create relationships  and so at the last minute people can    a driver can say   Hey  you know what  I really need the car  is it available   And that person will say   Sure  my wife's at home. Go pick up the keys. Go do it.  So you can have these really nice things that can't happen  and it's a kind of  Wow   and I want to say  Wow   type of thing that's happening here  because individuals  if you're a company  what happens is you might have    people who are in charge of innovation  or     people who are in charge of innovation. What happens in Peer  Inc. companies is that you have tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions of people who are creating experiments on this model  and so out of all that influence and that effort  you are having this exceptional amount of innovation that is coming out. So one of the reasons  if we come back to why did I call it Buzzcar  I wanted to remind all of us about the power of the hive  and its incredible facility to create this platform that individuals want to participate and innovate on. And for me  when I think about our future  and all of those problems that seem incredibly large  the scale is impossible  the urgency is there  Peers  Inc. provides the speed and scale and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems. All we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation    nontrivial. So I continue to think that transportation is the center of the hard universe. All problems come back to transportation for me. But there are all these other areas that are these profound  big problems that I know that we can work on  and people are working on them in many different sectors  but there's this really fabulous group of things with the power of this Peers  Inc. model. So over the last decade  we've been reveling in the power of the Internet and how it's empowered individuals  and for me  what Peers  Inc. does is it takes it up a notch. We're now bringing the power of the company and the corporation and supercharging individuals. So for me  it's a collaboration. Together  we can.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  I'm a neuroscientist  and I study decision making. I do experiments to test how different chemicals in the brain influence the choices we make. I'm here to tell you the secret to successful decision making  a cheese sandwich. That's right. According to scientists  a cheese sandwich is the solution to all your tough decisions. How do I know  I'm the scientist who did the study. A few years ago  my colleagues and I were interested in how a brain chemical called serotonin would influence people's decisions in social situations. Specifically  we wanted to know how serotonin would affect the way people react when they're treated unfairly. So we did an experiment. We manipulated people's serotonin levels by giving them this really disgusting tasting artificial lemon flavored drink that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin in the brain. This is the amino acid tryptophan. So what we found was  when tryptophan was low  people were more likely to take revenge when they're treated unfairly. That's the study we did  and here are some of the headlines that came out afterwards. And I thought the same thing myself when these came out  because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate. We gave people this horrible tasting drink that affected their tryptophan levels. But it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found in cheese and chocolate. And of course when science says cheese and chocolate help you make better decisions  well  that's sure to grab people's attention. So there you have it  the evolution of a headline. When this happened  a part of me thought  well  what's the big deal  So the media oversimplified a few things  but in the end  it's just a news story. And I think a lot of scientists have this attitude. But the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time  and it affects not just the stories you read in the news but also the products you see on the shelves. When the headlines rolled  what happened was  the marketers came calling. Would I be willing to provide a scientific endorsement of a mood boosting bottled water  Or would I go on television to demonstrate  in front of a live audience  that comfort foods really do make you feel better  I think these folks meant well  but had I taken them up on their offers  I would have been going beyond the science  and good scientists are careful not to do this. But nevertheless  neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing. Here's one example  Neuro drinks  a line of products  including Nuero Bliss here  which according to its label helps reduce stress  enhances mood  provides focused concentration  and promotes a positive outlook. I have to say  this sounds awesome.  Laughter  I could totally have used this    minutes ago. So when this came up in my local shop  naturally I was curious about some of the research backing these claims. So I went to the company's website looking to find some controlled trials of their products. But I didn't find any. Trial or no trial  these claims are front and center on their label right next to a picture of a brain. And it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties. A couple of researchers asked a few hundred people to read a scientific article. For half the people  the article included a brain image  and for the other half  it was the same article but it didn't have a brain image. At the end   you see where this is going   people were asked whether they agreed with the conclusions of the article. So this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image. And this is how much they agree with the same article that did include a brain image. So the take home message here is  do you want to sell it  Put a brain on it. Now let me pause here and take a moment to say that neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades  and we're constantly discovering amazing things about the brain. Like  just a couple of weeks ago  neuroscientists at MIT figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain. Really cool stuff. But the promise of neuroscience has led to some really high expectations and some overblown  unproven claims. So what I'm going to do is show you how to spot a couple of classic moves  dead giveaways  really  for what's variously been called neuro bunk  neuro bollocks  or  my personal favorite  neuro flapdoodle. So the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people's thoughts and emotions. Here's a study published by a team of researchers as an op ed in The New York Times. The headline   You Love Your iPhone. Literally.  It quickly became the most emailed article on the site. So how'd they figure this out  They put    people inside a brain scanner and showed them videos of ringing iPhones. The brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain called the insula  a region they say is linked to feelings of love and compassion. So they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula  this meant the subjects loved their iPhones. Now there's just one problem with this line of reasoning  and that's that the insula does a lot. Sure  it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion  but it's also involved in tons of other processes  like memory  language  attention  even anger  disgust and pain. So based on the same logic  I could equally conclude you hate your iPhone. The point here is  when you see activation in the insula  you can't just pick and choose your favorite explanation from off this list  and it's a really long list. My colleagues Tal Yarkoni and Russ Poldrack have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published. So chances are really  really good that your insula is going off right now  but I won't kid myself to think this means you love me. So speaking of love and the brain  there's a researcher  known to some as Dr. Love  who claims that scientists have found the glue that holds society together  the source of love and prosperity. This time it's not a cheese sandwich. No  it's a hormone called oxytocin. You've probably heard of it. So  Dr. Love bases his argument on studies showing that when you boost people's oxytocin  this increases their trust  empathy and cooperation. So he's calling oxytocin  the moral molecule.  Now these studies are scientifically valid  and they've been replicated  but they're not the whole story. Other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin increases envy. It increases gloating. Oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group at the expense of other groups. And in some cases  oxytocin can even decrease cooperation. So based on these studies  I could say oxytocin is an immoral molecule  and call myself Dr. Strangelove. So we've seen neuro flapdoodle all over the headlines. We see it in supermarkets  on book covers. What about the clinic  SPECT imaging is a brain scanning technology that uses a radioactive tracer to track blood flow in the brain. For the bargain price of a few thousand dollars  there are clinics in the U.S. that will give you one of these SPECT scans and use the image to help diagnose your problems. These scans  the clinics say  can help prevent Alzheimer's disease  solve weight and addiction issues  overcome marital conflicts  and treat  of course  a variety of mental illnesses ranging from depression to anxiety to ADHD. This sounds great. A lot of people agree. Some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions of dollars a year in business. There's just one problem. The broad consensus in neuroscience is that we can't yet diagnose mental illness from a single brain scan. But these clinics have treated tens of thousands of patients to date  many of them children  and SPECT imaging involves a radioactive injection  so exposing people to radiation  potentially harmful. I am more excited than most people  as a neuroscientist  about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness and even maybe to make us better and smarter. And if one day we can say that cheese and chocolate help us make better decisions  count me in. But we're not there yet. We haven't found a  buy  button inside the brain  we can't tell whether someone is lying or in love just by looking at their brain scans  and we can't turn sinners into saints with hormones. Maybe someday we will  but until then  we have to be careful that we don't let overblown claims detract resources and attention away from the real science that's playing a much longer game. So here's where you come in. If someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it  don't just take them at their word. Ask the tough questions. Ask to see the evidence. Ask for the part of the story that's not being told. The answers shouldn't be simple  because the brain isn't simple. But that's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway. Thank you.  Applause  Photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera  but today I want to share with you the    most treasured photos of mine  and I didn't take any of them. There were no art directors  no stylists  no chance for reshoots  not even any regard for lighting. In fact  most of them were taken by random tourists. My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement  and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday. We're on the corner of   th and  th. We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later  so we decided to take the same picture. Well you can see where this is going. Approaching my daughter's third birthday  my wife said   Hey  why don't you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father daughter trip  and continue the ritual   This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture. You know  it's remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger. No one's ever refused  and luckily no one's ever run off with our camera. Back then  we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives. It's really become sacred to us. This one was taken just weeks after       and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five year old could understand. So these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment  or even a specific trip. They're also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year  and not just physically  but in every way. Because while we take the same photo  our perspectives change  and she reaches new milestones  and I get to see life through her eyes  and how she interacts with and sees everything. This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year. Recently  on one trip  we were walking  and she stops dead in her tracks  and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips. And she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five year old standing in that exact spot. She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier. And now what she's looking at in New York are colleges  because she's determined to go to school in New York. And it hit me  One of the most important things we all make are memories. So I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories. I don't know about you  but aside from these    shots  I'm not in many of the family photos. I'm always the one taking the picture. So I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot  and don't hesitate to go up to someone and ask   Will you take our picture   Thank you.  Applause  So a friend of mine who's a political scientist  he told me several months ago exactly what this month would be like. He said  you know  there's this fiscal cliff coming  it's going to come at the beginning of     . Both parties absolutely need to resolve it  but neither party wants to be seen as the first to resolve it. Neither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it's due  so he said  December  you're just going to see lots of angry negotiations  negotiations breaking apart  reports of phone calls that aren't going well  people saying nothing's happening at all  and then sometime around Christmas or New Year's  we're going to hear   Okay  they resolved everything.  He told me that a few months ago. He said he's    percent positive they're going to resolve it  and I got an email from him today saying  all right  we're basically on track  but now I'm    percent positive that they're going to resolve it. And it made me think. I love studying these moments in American history when there was this frenzy of partisan anger  that the economy was on the verge of total collapse. The most famous early battle was Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson over what the dollar would be and how it would be backed up  with Alexander Hamilton saying   We need a central bank  the First Bank of the United States  or else the dollar will have no value. This economy won't work   and Thomas Jefferson saying   The people won't trust that. They just fought off a king. They're not going to accept some central authority.  This battle defined the first     years of the U.S. economy  and at every moment  different partisans saying   Oh my God  the economy's about to collapse   and the rest of us just going about  spending our bucks on whatever it is we wanted to buy. To give you a quick primer on where we are  a quick refresher on where we are. So the fiscal cliff  I was told that that's too partisan a thing to say  although I can't remember which party it's supporting or attacking. People say we should call it the fiscal slope  or we should call it an austerity crisis  but then other people say  no  that's even more partisan. So I just call it the self imposed  self destructive arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem. And this is what the inevitable problem looks like. So this is a projection of U.S. debt as a percentage of our overall economy  of GDP. The light blue dotted line represents the Congressional Budget Office's best guess of what will happen if Congress really doesn't do anything  and as you can see  sometime around       we reach Greek levels of debt  somewhere around     percent of GDP  which tells you that some time in the next    years  if Congress does absolutely nothing  we're going to hit a moment where the world's investors  the world's bond buyers  are going to say   We don't trust America anymore. We're not going to lend them any money  except at really high interest rates.  And at that moment our economy collapses. But remember  Greece is there today. We're there in    years. We have lots and lots of time to avoid that crisis  and the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt at trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis. Here's another way to look at exactly the same problem. The dark blue line is how much the government spends. The light blue line is how much the government gets in. And as you can see  for most of recent history  except for a brief period  we have consistently spent more than we take in. Thus the national debt. But as you can also see  projected going forward  the gap widens a bit and raises a bit  and this graph is only through     . It gets really  really ugly out towards     . And this graph sort of sums up what the problem is. The Democrats  they say  well  this isn't a big deal. We can just raise taxes a bit and close that gap  especially if we raise taxes on the rich. The Republicans say  hey  no  no  we've got a better idea. Why don't we lower both lines  Why don't we lower government spending and lower government taxes  and then we'll be on an even more favorable long term deficit trajectory  And behind this powerful disagreement between how to close that gap  there's the worst kind of cynical party politics  the worst kind of insider baseball  lobbying  all of that stuff  but there's also this powerfully interesting  respectful disagreement between two fundamentally different economic philosophies. And I like to think  when I picture how Republicans see the economy  what I picture is just some amazingly well engineered machine  some perfect machine. Unfortunately  I picture it made in Germany or Japan  but this amazing machine that's constantly scouring every bit of human endeavor and taking resources  money  labor  capital  machinery  away from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts  and while this might cause temporary dislocation  what it does is it builds up the more productive areas and lets the less productive areas fade away and die  and as a result the whole system is so much more efficient  so much richer for everybody. And this view generally believes that there is a role for government  a small role  to set the rules so people aren't lying and cheating and hurting each other  maybe  you know  have a police force and a fire department and an army  but to have a very limited reach into the mechanisms of this machinery. And when I picture how Democrats and Democratic leaning economists picture this economy  most Democratic economists are  you know  they're capitalists  they believe  yes  that's a good system a lot of the time. It's good to let markets move resources to their more productive use. But that system has tons of problems. Wealth piles up in the wrong places. Wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive. That's not going to create an equitable  fair society. That machine doesn't care about the environment  about racism  about all these issues that make this life worse for all of us  and so the government does have a role to take resources from more productive uses  or from richer sources  and give them to other sources. And when you think about the economy through these two different lenses  you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve  because the worse the crisis gets  the higher the stakes are  the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ruin everything. And I can get really despairing. I've spent a lot of the last few years really depressed about this  until this year  I learned something that I felt really excited about. I feel like it's really good news  and it's so shocking  I don't like saying it  because I think people won't believe me. But here's what I learned. The American people  taken as a whole  when it comes to these issues  to fiscal issues  are moderate  pragmatic centrists. And I know that's hard to believe  that the American people are moderate  pragmatic centrists. But let me explain what I'm thinking. When you look at how the federal government spends money  so this is the battle right here     percent  more than half  is on Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid  a few other health programs     percent defense     percent discretionary  and six percent interest. So when we're talking about cutting government spending  this is the pie we're talking about  and Americans overwhelmingly  and it doesn't matter what party they're in  overwhelmingly like that big    percent chunk. They like Social Security. They like Medicare. They even like Medicaid  even though that goes to the poor and indigent  which you might think would have less support. And they do not want it fundamentally touched  although the American people are remarkably comfortable  and Democrats roughly equal to Republicans  with some minor tweaks to make the system more stable. Social Security is fairly easy to fix. The rumors of its demise are always greatly exaggerated. So gradually raise Social Security retirement age  maybe only on people not yet born. Americans are about        whether they're Democrats or Republicans. Reduce Medicare for very wealthy seniors  seniors who make a lot of money. Don't even eliminate it. Just reduce it. People generally are comfortable with it  Democrats and Republicans. Raise medical health care contributions  Everyone hates that equally  but Republicans and Democrats hate that together. And so what this tells me is  when you look at the discussion of how to resolve our fiscal problems  we are not a nation that's powerfully divided on the major  major issue. We're comfortable with it needing some tweaks  but we want to keep it. We're not open to a discussion of eliminating it. Now there is one issue that is hyper partisan  and where there is one party that is just spend  spend  spend  we don't care  spend some more  and that of course is Republicans when it comes to military defense spending. They way outweigh Democrats. The vast majority want to protect military defense spending. That's    percent of the budget  and that presents a more difficult issue. I should also note that the  discretionary  spending  which is about    percent of the budget  that is Democratic and Republican issues  so you do have welfare  food stamps  other programs that tend to be popular among Democrats  but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of Department of Interior inducements for oil drilling and other things  which tend to be popular among Republicans. Now when it comes to taxes  there is more disagreement. That's a more partisan area. You have Democrats overwhelmingly supportive of raising the income tax on people who make         dollars a year  Republicans sort of against it  although if you break it out by income  Republicans who make less than        dollars a year like this idea. So basically Republicans who make more than         dollars a year don't want to be taxed. Raising taxes on investment income  you also see about two thirds of Democrats but only one third of Republicans are comfortable with that idea. This brings up a really important point  which is that we tend in this country to talk about Democrats and Republicans and think there's this little group over there called independents that's  what  two percent  If you add Democrats  you add Republicans  you've got the American people. But that is not the case at all. And it has not been the case for most of modern American history. Roughly a third of Americans say that they are Democrats. Around a quarter say that they are Republicans. A tiny little sliver call themselves libertarians  or socialists  or some other small third party  and the largest block     percent  say they're independents. So most Americans are not partisan  and most of the people in the independent camp fall somewhere in between  so even though we have tremendous overlap between the views on these fiscal issues of Democrats and Republicans  we have even more overlap when you add in the independents. Now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues. We get to hate each other on gun control and abortion and the environment  but on these fiscal issues  these important fiscal issues  we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say. And in fact  there's this other group of people who are not as divided as people might think  and that group is economists. I talk to a lot of economists  and back in the '  s and '  s it was ugly being an economist. You were in what they called the saltwater camp  meaning Harvard  Princeton  MIT  Stanford  Berkeley  or you were in the freshwater camp  University of Chicago  University of Rochester. You were a free market capitalist economist or you were a Keynesian liberal economist  and these people didn't go to each other's weddings  they snubbed each other at conferences. It's still ugly to this day  but in my experience  it is really  really hard to find an economist under    who still has that kind of way of seeing the world. The vast majority of economists    it is so uncool to call yourself an ideologue of either camp. The phrase that you want  if you're a graduate student or a postdoc or you're a professor  a    year old economics professor  is   I'm an empiricist. I go by the data.  And the data is very clear. None of these major theories have been completely successful. The   th century  the last hundred years  is riddled with disastrous examples of times that one school or the other tried to explain the past or predict the future and just did an awful  awful job  so the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty. They still are an awfully arrogant group of people  I will assure you  but they're now arrogant about their impartiality  and they  too  see a tremendous range of potential outcomes. And this nonpartisanship is something that exists  that has existed in secret in America for years and years and years. I've spent a lot of the fall talking to the three major organizations that survey American political attitudes  Pew Research  the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center  and the most important but the least known is the American National Election Studies group that is the world's longest  most respected poll of political attitudes. They've been doing it since       and what they show consistently throughout is that it's almost impossible to find Americans who are consistent ideologically  who consistently support   No we mustn't tax  and we must limit the size of government   or   No  we must encourage government to play a larger role in redistribution and correcting the ills of capitalism.  Those groups are very  very small. The vast majority of people  they pick and choose  they see compromise and they change over time when they hear a better argument or a worse argument. And that part of it has not changed. What has changed is how people respond to vague questions. If you ask people vague questions  like   Do you think there should be more government or less government    Do you think government should    especially if you use loaded language     Do you think the government should provide handouts   Or   Do you think the government should redistribute   Then you can see radical partisan change. But when you get specific  when you actually ask about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration  people are remarkably centrist  they're remarkably open to compromise. So what we have  then  when you think about the fiscal cliff  don't think of it as the American people fundamentally can't stand each other on these issues and that we must be ripped apart into two separate warring nations. Think of it as a tiny  tiny number of ancient economists and misrepresentative ideologues have captured the process. And they've captured the process through familiar ways  through a primary system which encourages that small group of people's voices  because that small group of people  the people who answer all yeses or all noes on those ideological questions  they might be small but every one of them has a blog  every one of them has been on Fox or MSNBC in the last week. Every one of them becomes a louder and louder voice  but they don't represent us. They don't represent what our views are. And that gets me back to the dollar  and it gets me back to reminding myself that we know this experience. We know what it's like to have these people on TV  in Congress  yelling about how the end of the world is coming if we don't adopt their view completely  because it's happened about the dollar ever since there's been a dollar. We had the battle between Jefferson and Hamilton. In       we had this ugly battle over the Federal Reserve  when it was created  with vicious  angry arguments over how it would be constituted  and a general agreement that the way it was constituted was the worst possible compromise  a compromise guaranteed to destroy this valuable thing  this dollar  but then everyone agreeing  okay  so long as we're on the gold standard  it should be okay. The Fed can't mess it up so badly. But then we got off the gold standard for individuals during the Depression and we got off the gold standard as a source of international currency coordination during Richard Nixon's presidency. Each of those times  we were on the verge of complete collapse. And nothing happened at all. Throughout it all  the dollar has been one of the most long standing  stable  reasonable currencies  and we all use it every single day  no matter what the people screaming about tell us  no matter how scared we're supposed to be. And this long term fiscal picture that we're in right now  I think what is most maddening about it is  if Congress were simply able to show not that they agree with each other  not that they're able to come up with the best possible compromise  but that they are able to just begin the process towards compromise  we all instantly are better off. The fear is that the world is watching. The fear is that the longer we delay any solution  the more the world will look to the U.S. not as the bedrock of stability in the global economy  but as a place that can't resolve its own fights  and the longer we put that off  the more we make the world nervous  the higher interest rates are going to be  the quicker we're going to have to face a day of horrible calamity. And so just the act of compromise itself  and sustained  real compromise  would give us even more time  would allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain and reach even more compromise down the road. So I'm in the media. I feel like my job to make this happen is to help foster the things that seem to lead to compromise  to not talk about this in those vague and scary terms that do polarize us  but to just talk about it like what it is  not an existential crisis  not some battle between two fundamentally different religious views  but a math problem  a really solvable math problem  one where we're not all going to get what we want and one where  you know  there's going to be a little pain to spread around. But the more we address it as a practical concern  the sooner we can resolve it  and the more time we have to resolve it  paradoxically. Thank you.  Applause  On March     this year  I posted this poster on Facebook. This is an image of me and my daughter holding the Israeli flag. I will try to explain to you about the context of why and when I posted. A few days ago  I was sitting waiting on the line at the grocery store  and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other  and the owner was explaining to the client that we're going to get        missiles on Israel. And the client was saying  no  it's        a day. We have this war with Iran coming for    years now  and we have people  you know  afraid. It's like every year it's the last minute that we can do something about the war with Iran. It's like  if we don't act now  it's too late forever  for    years now. So at some point it became  you know  to me  I'm a graphic designer  so I made posters about it and I posted the one I just showed you before. Most of the time  I make posters  I post them on Facebook  my friends like it  don't like it  most of the time don't like it  don't share it  don't nothing  and it's another day. So I went to sleep  and that was it for me. And later on in the night  I woke up because I'm always waking up in the night  and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots  you know  on Facebook  which I've never seen before. And I was like   What's going on   So I come to the computer and I start looking on  and suddenly I see many people talking to me  most of them I don't know  and a few of them from Iran  which is    What  Because you have to understand  in Israel we don't talk with people from Iran. We don't know people from Iran. It's like  on Facebook  you have friends only from    it's like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook. And now people from Iran are talking to me. So I start answering this girl  and she's telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come  because they don't have a computer  she asked her family to come to see the poster  and they're all sitting in the living room crying. So I'm like  whoa. I ask my wife to come  and I tell her  you have to see that. People are crying  and she came  she read the text  and she started to cry. And everybody's crying now.  Laughter  So I don't know what to do  so my first reflex  as a graphic designer  is  you know  to show everybody what I'd just seen  and people started to see them and to share them  and that's how it started. The day after  when really it became a lot of talking  I said to myself  and my wife said to me  I also want a poster  so this is her.  Laughter  Because it's working  put me in a poster now. But more seriously  I was like  okay  these ones work  but it's not just about me  it's about people from Israel who want to say something. So I'm going to shoot all the people I know  if they want  and I'm going to put them in a poster and I'm going to share them. So I went to my neighbors and friends and students and I just asked them  give me a picture  I will make you a poster. And that's how it started. And that's how  really  it's unleashed  because suddenly people from Facebook  friends and others  just understand that they can be part of it. It's not just one dude making one poster  it's    we can be part of it  so they start sending me pictures and ask me   Make me a poster. Post it. Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too.  It became  you know  at some point it was really  really intense. I mean  so many pictures  so I asked friends to come  graphic designers most of them  to make posters with me  because I didn't have the time. It was a huge amount of pictures. So for a few days  that's how my living room was. And we received Israeli posters  Israeli images  but also lots of comments  lots of messages from Iran. And we took these messages and we made posters out of it  because I know people  They don't read  they see images. If it's an image  they may read it. So here are a few of them. of a girl who has been raised in Iran to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning  and now that she sees the posters that we're sending  she starts    she said that she changed her mind  and now she loves that blue  she loves that star  and she loves that flag  talking about the Israeli flag  and she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another  and just a few days after I posted the first poster. The day after  Iranians started to respond with their own posters. They have graphic designers. What   Laughter  Crazy  crazy. So you can see they are still shy  they don't want to show their faces  but they want to spread the message. They want to respond. They want to say the same thing. So. And now it's communication. It's a two way story. It's Israelis and Iranians sending the same message  one to each other. This never happened before  and this is two people supposed to be enemies  we're on the verge of a war  and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say   I like this guy. I love those guys.  And it became really big at some point. And then it became news. Because when you're seeing the Middle East  you see only the bad news. And suddenly  there is something that was happening that was good news. So the guys on the news  they say   Okay  let's talk about this.  And they just came  and it was so much  I remember one day  Michal  she was talking with the journalist  and she was asking him   Who's gonna see the show  And he said   Everybody.  So she said   Everybody in Palestine  in where  Israel  Who is everybody   Everybody.  They said   Syria    Syria.   Lebanon   Lebanon.  At some point  he just said      million people are going to see you today. It's everybody.  The Chinese. And we were just at the beginning of the story. Something crazy also happened. Every time a country started talking about it  like Germany  America  wherever  a page on Facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories  so at the beginning we had  Iran Loves Israel   which is an Iranian sitting in Tehran  saying   Okay  Israel loves Iran  I give you Iran Loves Israel.  You have Palestine Loves Israel. You have Lebanon that just    a few days ago. And this whole list of pages on Facebook dedicated to the same message  to people sending their love  one to each other. The moment I really understood that something was happening  a friend of mine told me   Google the word 'Israel.'  And those were the first images on those days that popped up from Google when you were typing   Israel  or  Iran.  We really changed how people see the Middle East. Because you're not in the Middle East. You're somewhere over there  and then you want to see the Middle East  so you go on Google and you say   Israel   and they give you the bad stuff. And for a few days you got those images. Today the Israel Loves Iran page is this number          and two million people last week went on the page and shared  liked  I don't know  commented on one of the photos. So for five months now  that's what we are doing  me  Michal  a few of my friends  are just making images. We're showing a new reality by just making images because that's how the world perceives us. They see images of us  and they see bad images. So we're working on making good images. End of story. Look at this one. This is the Iran Loves Israel page. This is not the Israel Loves Iran. This is not my page. This is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance of the Israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page. This is the enemy. What  And it's going both ways. It's like  we are showing respect  one to each other. And we're understanding. And you show compassion. And you become friends. And at some point  you become friends on Facebook  and you become friends in life. You can go and travel and meet people. And I was in Munich a few weeks ago. I went there to open an exposition about Iran and I met there with people from the page that told me   Okay  you're going to be in Europe  I'm coming. I'm coming from France  from Holland  from Germany   of course  and from Israel people came  and we just met there for the first time in real life. I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time. And we just shake hands  and have a coffee and a nice discussion  and we talk about food and basketball. And that was the end of it. Remember that image from the beginning  At some point we met in real life  and we became friends. And it goes the other way around. Some girl that we met on Facebook never been in Israel  born and raised in Iran  lives in Germany  afraid of Israelis because of what she knows about us  decides after a few months of talking on the Internet with some Israelis to come to Israel  and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion and says   Okay  not that big a deal.  So a few weeks ago  the stress is getting higher  so we start this new campaign called  Not ready to die in your war.  I mean  it's plus minus the same message  but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it. And again  something amazing happened  something that we didn't have on the first wave of the campaign. Now people from Iran  the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent  you know  their foot and half their faces  now they're sending their faces  and they're saying   Okay  no problem  we're into it. We are with you.  Just read where those guys are from. And for every guy from Israel  you've got someone from Iran. Just people sending their pictures. Crazy  yes  So    So you may ask yourself  who is this dude  My name is Ronny Edry  and I'm     I'm an Israeli  I'm a father of two  I'm a husband  and I'm a graphic designer. I'm teaching graphic design. And I'm not that naive  because a lot of the time I've been asked  many times I've been asked   Yeah  but  this is really naive  sending flowers over  I mean     I was in the army. I was in the paratroopers for three years  and I know how it looks from the ground. I know how it can look really bad. So to me  this is the courageous thing to do  to try to reach the other side before it's too late  because when it's going to be too late  it's going to be too late. And sometimes war is inevitable  sometimes  but maybe  with  effort  we can avoid it. Maybe as people  because especially in Israel  we're in a democracy. We have the freedom of speech  and maybe that little thing can change something. And really  we can be our own ambassadors. We can just send a message and hope for the best. So I want to ask Michal  my wife  to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image  because it's all about images. And maybe that image will help us change something. Just raise that. Exactly. And I'm just going to take a picture of it  and I'm just going to post it on Facebook with kind of  Israelis for peace  or something. Oh my God. Don't cry. Thank you guys. One day in             miles off the coast of Chile  in one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean     American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater. They'd been struck by a sperm whale  which had ripped a catastrophic hole in the ship's hull. As their ship began to sink beneath the swells  the men huddled together in three small whaleboats. These men were        miles from home  more than       miles from the nearest scrap of land. In their small boats  they carried only rudimentary navigational equipment and limited supplies of food and water. These were the men of the whaleship Essex  whose story would later inspire parts of  Moby Dick.  Even in today's world  their situation would be really dire  but think about how much worse it would have been then. No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong. No search party was coming to look for these men. So most of us have never experienced a situation as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves  but we all know what it's like to be afraid. We know how fear feels  but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about what our fears mean. As we grow up  we're often encouraged to think of fear as a weakness  just another childish thing to discard like baby teeth or roller skates. And I think it's no accident that we think this way. Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings are hard wired to be optimists. So maybe that's why we think of fear  sometimes  as a danger in and of itself.  Don't worry   we like to say to one another.  Don't panic.  In English  fear is something we conquer. It's something we fight. It's something we overcome. But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way  What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination  something that can be as profound and insightful as storytelling itself  It's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination in young children  whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid. When I was a child  I lived in California  which is  you know  mostly a very nice place to live  but for me as a child  California could also be a little scary. I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier that hung above our dining table swing back and forth during every minor earthquake  and I sometimes couldn't sleep at night  terrified that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping. And what we say about kids who have fears like that is that they have a vivid imagination. But at a certain point  most of us learn to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up. We learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed  and not every earthquake brings buildings down. But maybe it's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults. The same incredible imaginations that produced  The Origin of Species    Jane Eyre  and  The Remembrance of Things Past   also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives of Charles Darwin  Charlotte Bront   and Marcel Proust. So the question is  what can the rest of us learn about fear from visionaries and young children  Well let's return to the year      for a moment  to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex. Let's take a look at the fears that their imaginations were generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific. Twenty four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship. The time had come for the men to make a plan  but they had very few options. In his fascinating account of the disaster  Nathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just about as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth. The men knew that the nearest islands they could reach were the Marquesas Islands        miles away. But they'd heard some frightening rumors. They'd been told that these islands  and several others nearby  were populated by cannibals. So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered and eaten for dinner. Another possible destination was Hawaii  but given the season  the captain was afraid they'd be struck by severe storms. Now the last option was the longest  and the most difficult  to sail       miles due south in hopes of reaching a certain band of winds that could eventually push them toward the coast of South America. But they knew that the sheer length of this journey would stretch their supplies of food and water. To be eaten by cannibals  to be battered by storms  to starve to death before reaching land. These were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men  and as it turned out  the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died. Now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name. What if instead of calling them fears  we called them stories  Because that's really what fear is  if you think about it. It's a kind of unintentional storytelling that we are all born knowing how to do. And fears and storytelling have the same components. They have the same architecture. Like all stories  fears have characters. In our fears  the characters are us. Fears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends. You board the plane. The plane takes off. The engine fails. Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel. Picture a cannibal  human teeth sinking into human skin  human flesh roasting over a fire. Fears also have suspense. If I've done my job as a storyteller today  you should be wondering what happened to the men of the whaleship Essex. Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense. Just like all great stories  our fears focus our attention on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature  What will happen next  In other words  our fears make us think about the future. And humans  by the way  are the only creatures capable of thinking about the future in this way  of projecting ourselves forward in time  and this mental time travel is just one more thing that fears have in common with storytelling. As a writer  I can tell you that a big part of writing fiction is learning to predict how one event in a story will affect all the other events  and fear works in that same way. In fear  just like in fiction  one thing always leads to another. When I was writing my first novel   The Age Of Miracles   I spent months trying to figure out what would happen if the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down. What would happen to our days  What would happen to our crops  What would happen to our minds  And then it was only later that I realized how very similar these questions were to the ones I used to ask myself as a child frightened in the night. If an earthquake strikes tonight  I used to worry  what will happen to our house  What will happen to my family  And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story. So if we think of our fears as more than just fears but as stories  we should think of ourselves as the authors of those stories. But just as importantly  we need to think of ourselves as the readers of our fears  and how we choose to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives. Now  some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others. I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs  and the author found that these people shared a habit that he called  productive paranoia   which meant that these people  instead of dismissing their fears  these people read them closely  they studied them  and then they translated that fear into preparation and action. So that way  if their worst fears came true  their businesses were ready. And sometimes  of course  our worst fears do come true. That's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear. Once in a while  our fears can predict the future. But we can't possibly prepare for all of the fears that our imaginations concoct. So how can we tell the difference between the fears worth listening to and all the others  I think the end of the story of the whaleship Essex offers an illuminating  if tragic  example. After much deliberation  the men finally made a decision. Terrified of cannibals  they decided to forgo the closest islands and instead embarked on the longer and much more difficult route to South America. After more than two months at sea  the men ran out of food as they knew they might  and they were still quite far from land. When the last of the survivors were finally picked up by two passing ships  less than half of the men were left alive  and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism. Herman Melville  who used this story as research for  Moby Dick   wrote years later  and from dry land  quote   All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex might in all human probability have been avoided had they  immediately after leaving the wreck  steered straight for Tahiti. But   as Melville put it   they dreaded cannibals.  So the question is  why did these men dread cannibals so much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation  Why were they swayed by one story so much more than the other  Looked at from this angle  theirs becomes a story about reading. The novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best reader has a combination of two very different temperaments  the artistic and the scientific. A good reader has an artist's passion  a willingness to get caught up in the story  but just as importantly  the readers also needs the coolness of judgment of a scientist  which acts to temper and complicate the reader's intuitive reactions to the story. As we've seen  the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part. They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios. The problem was that they listened to the wrong story. Of all the narratives their fears wrote  they responded only to the most lurid  the most vivid  the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture  cannibals. But perhaps if they'd been able to read their fears more like a scientist  with more coolness of judgment  they would have listened instead to the less violent but the more likely tale  the story of starvation  and headed for Tahiti  just as Melville's sad commentary suggests. And maybe if we all tried to read our fears  we too would be less often swayed by the most salacious among them. Maybe then we'd spend less time worrying about serial killers and plane crashes  and more time concerned with the subtler and slower disasters we face  the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries  the gradual changes in our climate. Just as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest  so too might our subtlest fears be the truest. Read in the right way  our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination  a kind of everyday clairvoyance  a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there's still time to influence how that future will play out. Properly read  our fears can offer us something as precious as our favorite works of literature  a little wisdom  a bit of insight and a version of that most elusive thing    the truth. Thank you.  Applause  So I'd like to start by focusing on the world's most dangerous animal. Now  when you talk about dangerous animals  most people might think of lions or tigers or sharks. But of course the most dangerous animal is the mosquito. The mosquito has killed more humans than any other creature in human history. In fact  probably adding them all together  the mosquito has killed more humans. And the mosquito has killed more humans than wars and plague. And you would think  would you not  that with all our science  with all our advances in society  with better towns  better civilizations  better sanitation  wealth  that we would get better at controlling mosquitos  and hence reduce this disease. And that's not really the case. If it was the case  we wouldn't have between     and     million cases of malaria every year  and we wouldn't have a million and a half deaths from malaria  and we wouldn't have a disease that was relatively unknown    years ago now suddenly turned into the largest mosquito borne virus threat that we have  and that's called dengue fever. So    years ago  pretty much no one had heard of it  no one certainly in the European environment. But dengue fever now  according to the World Health Organization  infects between    and     million people every year  so that's equivalent to the whole of the population of the U.K. being infected every year. Other estimates put that number at roughly double that number of infections. And dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally. In the last    years  the incidence of dengue has grown thirtyfold. Now let me tell you a little bit about what dengue fever is  for those who don't know. Now let's assume you go on holiday. Let's assume you go to the Caribbean  or you might go to Mexico. You might go to Latin America  Asia  Africa  anywhere in Saudi Arabia. You might go to India  the Far East. It doesn't really matter. It's the same mosquito  and it's the same disease. You're at risk. And let's assume you're bitten by a mosquito that's carrying that virus. Well  you could develop flu like symptoms. They could be quite mild. You could develop nausea  headache  your muscles could feel like they're contracting  and you could actually feel like your bones are breaking. And that's the nickname given to this disease. It's called breakbone fever  because that's how you can feel. Now the odd thing is  is that once you've been bitten by this mosquito  and you've had this disease  your body develops antibodies  so if you're bitten again with that strain  it doesn't affect you. But it's not one virus  it's four  and the same protection that gives you the antibodies and protects you from the same virus that you had before actually makes you much more susceptible to the other three. So the next time you get dengue fever  if it's a different strain  you're more susceptible  you're likely to get worse symptoms  and you're more likely to get the more severe forms  hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome. So you don't want dengue once  and you certainly don't want it again. So why is it spreading so fast  And the answer is this thing. This is Aedes aegypti. Now this is a mosquito that came  like its name suggests  out of North Africa  and it's spread round the world. Now  in fact  a single mosquito will only travel about     yards in its entire life. They don't travel very far. What they're very good at doing is hitchhiking  particularly the eggs. They will lay their eggs in clear water  any pool  any puddle  any birdbath  any flower pot  anywhere there's clear water  they'll lay their eggs  and if that clear water is near freight  it's near a port  if it's anywhere near transport  those eggs will then get transported around the world. And that's what's happened. Mankind has transported these eggs all the way around the world  and these insects have infested over     countries  and there's now  .  billion people living in countries where this mosquito resides. To give you just a couple of examples how fast this has happened  in the mid '  s  Brazil declared   We have no Aedes aegypti   and currently they spend about a billion dollars now a year trying to get rid of it  trying to control it  just one species of mosquito. Two days ago  or yesterday  I can't remember which  I saw a Reuters report that said Madeira had had their first cases of dengue  about    cases  with about     probable cases. That's two days ago. Interestingly  Madeira first got the insect in       and here we are  a few years later  first cases of dengue. So the one thing you'll find is that where the mosquito goes  dengue will follow. Once you've got the mosquito in your area  anyone coming into that area with dengue  mosquito will bite them  mosquito will bite somewhere else  somewhere else  somewhere else  and you'll get an epidemic. So we must be good at killing mosquitos. I mean  that can't be very difficult. Well  there's two principle ways. The first way is that you use larvicides. You use chemicals. You put them into water where they breed. Now in an urban environment  that's extraordinarily difficult. You've got to get your chemical into every puddle  every birdbath  every tree trunk. It's just not practical. The second way you can do it is actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around. This is a picture of fogging. Here what someone is doing is mixing up chemical in a smoke and basically spreading that through the environment. You could do the same with a space spray. This is really unpleasant stuff  and if it was any good  we wouldn't have this massive increase in mosquitos and we wouldn't have this massive increase in dengue fever. So it's not very effective  but it's probably the best thing we've got at the moment. Having said that  actually  your best form of protection and my best form of protection is a long sleeve shirt and a little bit of DEET to go with it. So let's start again. Let's design a product  right from the word go  and decide what we want. Well we clearly need something that is effective at reducing the mosquito population. There's no point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there. We want something that gets that population right the way down so it can't get the disease transmission. Clearly the product you've got has got to be safe to humans. We are going to use it in and around humans. It has to be safe. We don't want to have a lasting impact on the environment. We don't want to do anything that you can't undo. Maybe a better product comes along in        years. Fine. We don't want a lasting environmental impact. We want something that's relatively cheap  or cost effective  because there's an awful lot of countries involved  and some of them are emerging markets  some of them emerging countries  low income. And finally  you want something that's species specific. You want to get rid of this mosquito that spreads dengue  but you don't really want to get all the other insects. Some are quite beneficial. Some are important to your ecosystem. This one's not. It's invaded you. But you don't want to get all of the insects. You just want to get this one. And most of the time  you'll find this insect lives in and around your home  so this    whatever we do has got to get to that insect. It's got to get into people's houses  into the bedrooms  into the kitchens. Now there are two features of mosquito biology that really help us in this project  and that is  firstly  males don't bite. It's only the female mosquito that will actually bite you. The male can't bite you  won't bite you  doesn't have the mouth parts to bite you. It's just the female. And the second is a phenomenon that males are very  very good at finding females. If there's a male mosquito that you release  and if there's a female around  that male will find the female. So basically  we've used those two factors. So here's a typical situation  male meets female  lots of offspring. A single female will lay about up to     eggs at a time  up to about     in her lifetime. Now if that male is carrying a gene which causes the death of the offspring  then the offspring don't survive  and instead of having     mosquitos running around  you have none. And if you can put more  I'll call them sterile  that the offspring will actually die at different stages  but I'll call them sterile for now. If you put more sterile males out into the environment  then the females are more likely to find a sterile male than a fertile one  and you will bring that population down. So the males will go out  they'll look for females  they'll mate. If they mate successfully  then no offspring. If they don't find a female  then they'll die anyway. They only live a few days. And that's exactly where we are. So this is technology that was developed in Oxford University a few years ago. The company itself  Oxitec  we've been working for the last    years  very much on a sort of similar development pathway that you'd get with a pharmaceutical company. So about    years of internal evaluation  testing  to get this to a state where we think it's actually ready. And then we've gone out into the big outdoors  always with local community consent  always with the necessary permits. So we've done field trials now in the Cayman Islands  a small one in Malaysia  and two more now in Brazil. And what's the result  Well  the result has been very good. In about four months of release  we've brought that population of mosquitos   in most cases we're dealing with villages here of about              people  that sort of size  starting small   we've taken that mosquito population down by about    percent in about four months. And in fact  the numbers after that get  those get very difficult to count  because there just aren't any left. So that's been what we've seen in Cayman  it's been what we've seen in Brazil in those trials. And now what we're doing is we're going through a process to scale up to a town of about         so we can see this work at big scale. And we've got a production unit in Oxford  or just south of Oxford  where we actually produce these mosquitos. We can produce them  in a space a bit more than this red carpet  I can produce about    million a week. We can transport them around the world. It's not very expensive  because it's a coffee cup    something the size of a coffee cup will hold about three million eggs. So freight costs aren't our biggest problem.  Laughter  So we've got that. You could call it a mosquito factory. And for Brazil  where we've been doing some trials  the Brazilian government themselves have now built their own mosquito factory  far bigger than ours  and we'll use that for scaling up in Brazil. There you are. We've sent mosquito eggs. We've separated the males from the females. The males have been put in little pots and the truck is going down the road and they are releasing males as they go. It's actually a little bit more precise than that. You want to release them so that you get good coverage of your area. So you take a Google Map  you divide it up  work out how far they can fly  and make sure you're releasing such that you get coverage of the area  and then you go back  and within a very short space of time  you're bringing that population right the way down. We've also done this in agriculture. We've got several different species of agriculture coming along  and I'm hoping that soon we'll be able to get some funding together so we can get back and start looking at malaria. So that's where we stand at the moment  and I've just got a few final thoughts  which is that this is another way in which biology is now coming in to supplement chemistry in some of our societal advances in this area  and these biological approaches are coming in in very different forms  and when you think about genetic engineering  we've now got enzymes for industrial processing  enzymes  genetically engineered enzymes in food. We have G.M. crops  we have pharmaceuticals  we have new vaccines  all using roughly the same technology  but with very different outcomes. And I'm in favor  actually. Of course I am. I'm in favor of particularly where the older technologies don't work well or have become unacceptable. And although the techniques are similar  the outcomes are very  very different  and if you take our approach  for example  and you compare it to  say  G.M. crops  both techniques are trying to produce a massive benefit. Both have a side benefit  which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously. But whereas a G.M. crop is trying to protect the plant  for example  and give it an advantage  what we're actually doing is taking the mosquito and giving it the biggest disadvantage it can possibly have  rendering it unable to reproduce effectively. So for the mosquito  it's a dead end. Thank you very much.  Applause  We live in an incredibly busy world. The pace of life is often frantic  our minds are always busy  and we're always doing something. So with that in mind  I'd like you just to take a moment to think  when did you last take any time to do nothing  Just    minutes  undisturbed  And when I say nothing  I do mean nothing. So that's no emailing  texting  no Internet  no TV  no chatting  no eating  no reading. Not even sitting there reminiscing about the past or planning for the future. Simply doing nothing. I see a lot of very blank faces. You probably have to go a long way back. And this is an extraordinary thing  right  We're talking about our mind. The mind  our most valuable and precious resource  through which we experience every single moment of our life. The mind that we rely upon to be happy  content  emotionally stable as individuals  and at the same time  to be kind and thoughtful and considerate in our relationships with others. This is the same mind that we depend upon to be focused  creative  spontaneous  and to perform at our very best in everything that we do. And yet  we don't take any time out to look after it. In fact  we spend more time looking after our cars  our clothes and our hair than we    okay  maybe not our hair  but you see where I'm going. The result  of course  is that we get stressed. You know  the mind whizzes away like a washing machine going round and round  lots of difficult  confusing emotions  and we don't really know how to deal with that. And the sad fact is that we are so distracted that we're no longer present in the world in which we live. We miss out on the things that are most important to us  and the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes  that's the way life is  so we've just kind of got to get on with it. That's really not how it has to be. So I was about    when I went along to my first meditation class. And trust me  it had all the stereotypes that you can imagine  the sitting cross legged on the floor  the incense  the herbal tea  the vegetarians  the whole deal  but my mom was going and I was intrigued  so I went along with her. I'd also seen a few kung fu movies  and secretly I kind of thought I might be able to learn how to fly  but I was very young at the time. Now as I was there  I guess  like a lot of people  I assumed that it was just an aspirin for the mind. You get stressed  you do some meditation. I hadn't really thought that it could be sort of preventative in nature  until I was about     when a number of things happened in my life in quite quick succession  really serious things which just flipped my life upside down and all of a sudden I was inundated with thoughts  inundated with difficult emotions that I didn't know how to cope with. Every time I sort of pushed one down  another one would pop back up again. It was a really very stressful time. I guess we all deal with stress in different ways. Some people will bury themselves in work  grateful for the distraction. Others will turn to their friends  their family  looking for support. Some people hit the bottle  start taking medication. My own way of dealing with it was to become a monk. So I quit my degree  I headed off to the Himalayas  I became a monk  and I started studying meditation. People often ask me what I learned from that time. Well  obviously it changed things. Let's face it  becoming a celibate monk is going to change a number of things. But it was more than that. It taught me    it gave me a greater appreciation  an understanding for the present moment. By that I mean not being lost in thought  not being distracted  not being overwhelmed by difficult emotions  but instead learning how to be in the here and now  how to be mindful  how to be present. I think the present moment is so underrated. It sounds so ordinary  and yet we spend so little time in the present moment that it's anything but ordinary. There was a research paper that came out of Harvard  just recently  that said on average  our minds are lost in thought almost    percent of the time.    percent. At the same time  this sort of constant mind wandering is also a direct cause of unhappiness. Now we're not here for that long anyway  but to spend almost half of our life lost in thought and potentially quite unhappy  I don't know  it just kind of seems tragic  actually  especially when there's something we can do about it  when there's a positive  practical  achievable  scientifically proven technique which allows our mind to be more healthy  to be more mindful and less distracted. And the beauty of it is that even though it need only take about    minutes a day  it impacts our entire life. But we need to know how to do it. We need an exercise. We need a framework to learn how to be more mindful. That's essentially what meditation is. It's familiarizing ourselves with the present moment. But we also need to know how to approach it in the right way to get the best from it. And that's what these are for  in case you've been wondering  because most people assume that meditation is all about stopping thoughts  getting rid of emotions  somehow controlling the mind  but actually it's quite different from that. It's more about stepping back  sort of seeing the thought clearly  witnessing it coming and going  emotions coming and going without judgment  but with a relaxed  focused mind. So for example  right now  if I focus too much on the balls  then there's no way I can relax and talk to you at the same time. Equally  if I relax too much talking to you  there's no way I can focus on the balls. I'm going to drop them. Now in life  and in meditation  there'll be times when the focus becomes a little bit too intense  and life starts to feel a bit like this. It's a very uncomfortable way to live life  when you get this tight and stressed. At other times  we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much  and things just become a sort of little bit like this. Of course in meditation    we're going to end up falling asleep. So we're looking for a balance  a focused relaxation where we can allow thoughts to come and go without all the usual involvement. Now  what usually happens when we're learning to be mindful is that we get distracted by a thought. Let's say this is an anxious thought. Everything's going fine  and we see the anxious thought.  Oh  I didn't realize I was worried about that.  You go back to it  repeat it.  Oh  I am worried. I really am worried. Wow  there's so much anxiety.  And before we know it  right  we're anxious about feeling anxious. You know  this is crazy. We do this all the time  even on an everyday level. If you think about the last time you had a wobbly tooth. You know it's wobbly  and you know that it hurts. But what do you do every        seconds  It does hurt. And we reinforce the storyline  right  And we just keep telling ourselves  and we do it all the time. And it's only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go of those storylines and patterns of mind. But when you sit down and you watch the mind in this way  you might see many different patterns. You might find a mind that's really restless and    the whole time. Don't be surprised if you feel a bit agitated in your body when you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that. You might find a mind that's very dull and boring  and it's just  almost mechanical  it just seems it's as if you're getting up  going to work  eat  sleep  get up  work. Or it might just be that one little nagging thought that just goes round and round your mind. Well  whatever it is  meditation offers the opportunity  the potential to step back and to get a different perspective  to see that things aren't always as they appear. We can't change every little thing that happens to us in life  but we can change the way that we experience it. That's the potential of meditation  of mindfulness. You don't have to burn any incense  and you definitely don't have to sit on the floor. All you need to do is to take    minutes out a day to step back  to familiarize yourself with the present moment so that you get to experience a greater sense of focus  calm and clarity in your life. Thank you very much. The filmmaker Georges M li s was first a magician. Now movies proved to be the ultimate medium for magic. With complete control of everything the audience can see  moviemakers had developed an arsenal of techniques to further their deceptions. Motion pictures are themselves an illusion of life  produced by the sequential projection of still frames  and they astonished the Lumi re brothers' early audiences. Even today's sophisticated moviegoers still lose themselves to the screen  and filmmakers leverage this separation from reality to great effect. Now imaginative people have been having fun with this for over     years. Giambattista della Porta  a Neapolitan scholar in the   th century  examined and studied the natural world and saw how it could be manipulated. Playing with the world  and our perception of it  really is the essence of visual effects. So digging deeper into this with the Science and Technology Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences reveals some truth behind the trickery. Visual effects are based on the principles of all illusions  assumption  things are as we know them  presumption  things will behave as we expect  and context in reality  our knowledge of the world as we know it  such as scale. Now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession  which is  never betray the illusion. And that last point has made visual effects a constant quest for perfection. So from the hand cranked jump cut early days of cinema to last Sunday's Oscar winner  what follows are some steps and a few repeats in the evolution of visual effects. I hope you will enjoy.

So if you've been following the news  you've heard that there's a pack of giant asteroids headed for the United States  all scheduled to strike within the next    years. Now I don't mean actual asteroids made of rock and metal. That actually wouldn't be such a problem  because if we were really all going to die  we would put aside our differences  we'd spend whatever it took  and we'd find a way to deflect them. I'm talking instead about threats that are headed our way  but they're wrapped in a special energy field that polarizes us  and therefore paralyzes us. Last March  I went to the TED conference  and I saw Jim Hansen speak  the NASA scientist who first raised the alarm about global warming in the     s  and it seems that the predictions he made back then are coming true. This is where we're headed in terms of global temperature rises  and if we keep on going the way we're going  we get a four  or five degree Centigrade temperature rise by the end of this century. Hansen says we can expect about a five meter rise in sea levels. This is what a five meter rise in sea levels would look like. Low lying cities all around the world will disappear within the lifetime of children born today. Hansen closed his talk by saying   Imagine a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth. That is the equivalent of what we face now. Yet we dither  taking no action to deflect the asteroid  even though the longer we wait  the more difficult and expensive it becomes.  Of course  the left wants to take action  but the right denies that there's any problem. All right  so I go back from TED  and then the following week  I'm invited to a dinner party in Washington  D.C.  where I know that I'll be meeting a number of conservative intellectuals  including Yuval Levin  and to prepare for the meeting  I read this article by Levin in National Affairs called  Beyond the Welfare State.  Levin writes that all over the world  nations are coming to terms with the fact that the social democratic welfare state is turning out to be untenable and unaffordable  dependent upon dubious economics and the demographic model of a bygone era. All right  now this might not sound as scary as an asteroid  but look at these graphs that Levin showed. This graph shows the national debt as a percentage of America's GDP  and as you see  if you go all the way back to the founding  we borrowed a lot of money to fight the Revolutionary War. Wars are expensive. But then we'd pay it off  pay it off  pay it off  and then  oh  what's this  The Civil War. Even more expensive. Borrow a lot of money  pay it off  pay it off  pay it off  get down to near zero  and bang     World War I. Once again  the same process repeats. Now then we get the Great Depression and World War II. We rise to an astronomical level  around     percent of GDP  really unsustainable  really dangerous. But we pay it off  pay it off  pay it off  and then  what's this  Why has it been rising since the '  s  It's partly due to tax cuts that were unfunded  but it's due primarily to the rise of entitlement spending  especially Medicare. We're approaching the levels of indebtedness we had at World War II  and the baby boomers haven't even retired yet  and when they do  this is what will happen. This is data from the Congressional Budget Office showing its most realistic forecast of what would happen if current situations and expectations and trends are extended. All right  now what you might notice is that these two graphs are actually identical  not in terms of the x  and y axes  or in terms of the data they present  but in terms of their moral and political implications  they say the same thing. Let me translate for you.  We are doomed unless we start acting now. What's wrong with you people on the other side in the other party  Can't you see reality  If you won't help  then get the hell out of the way.  We can deflect both of these asteroids. These problems are both technically solvable. Our problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper partisan times  the mere fact that one side says   Look  there's an asteroid   means that the other side's going to say   Huh  What  No  I'm not even going to look up. No.  To understand why this is happening to us  and what we can do about it  we need to learn more about moral psychology. So I'm a social psychologist  and I study morality  and one of the most important principles of morality is that morality binds and blinds. It binds us into teams that circle around sacred values but thereby makes us go blind to objective reality. Think of it like this. Large scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet. There are only a few species that can do it. That's a beehive. That's a termite mound  a giant termite mound. And when you find this in other animals  it's always the same story. They're always all siblings who are children of a single queen  so they're all in the same boat. They rise or fall  they live or die  as one. There's only one species on the planet that can do this without kinship  and that  of course  is us. This is a reconstruction of ancient Babylon  and this is Tenochtitlan. Now how did we do this  How did we go from being hunter gatherers        years ago to building these gigantic cities in just a few thousand years  It's miraculous  and part of the explanation is this ability to circle around sacred values. As you see  temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations. This is an image of Muslims circling the Kaaba in Mecca. It's a sacred rock  and when people circle something together  they unite  they can trust each other  they become one. It's as though you're moving an electrical wire through a magnetic field that generates current. When people circle together  they generate a current. We love to circle around things. We circle around flags  and then we can trust each other. We can fight as a team  as a unit. But even as morality binds people together into a unit  into a team  the circling blinds them. It causes them to distort reality. We begin separating everything into good versus evil. Now that process feels great. It feels really satisfying. But it is a gross distortion of reality. You can see the moral electromagnet operating in the U.S. Congress. This is a graph that shows the degree to which voting in Congress falls strictly along the left right axis  so that if you know how liberal or conservative someone is  you know exactly how they voted on all the major issues. And what you can see is that  in the decades after the Civil War  Congress was extraordinarily polarized  as you would expect  about as high as can be. But then  after World War I  things dropped  and we get this historically low level of polarization. This was a golden age of bipartisanship  at least in terms of the parties' ability to work together and solve grand national problems. But in the     s and '  s  the electromagnet turns back on. Polarization rises. It used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals could all work together in Congress. They could rearrange themselves  form bipartisan committees  but as the moral electromagnet got cranked up  the force field increased  Democrats and Republicans were pulled apart. It became much harder for them to socialize  much harder for them to cooperate. Retiring members nowadays say that it's become like gang warfare. Did anybody notice that in two of the three debates  Obama wore a blue tie and Romney wore a red tie  Do you know why they do this  It's so that the Bloods and the Crips will know which side to vote for.  Laughter  The polarization is strongest among our political elites. Nobody doubts that this is happening in Washington. But for a while  there was some doubt as to whether it was happening among the people. Well  in the last    years it's become much more apparent that it is. So look at this data. This is from the American National Elections Survey. And what they do on that survey is they ask what's called a feeling thermometer rating. So  how warm or cold do you feel about  you know  Native Americans  or the military  the Republican Party  the Democratic Party  all sorts of groups in American life. The blue line shows how warmly Democrats feel about Democrats  and they like them. You know  ratings in the   s on a     point scale. Republicans like Republicans. That's not a surprise. But when you look at cross party ratings  you find  well  that it's lower  but actually  when I first saw this data  I was surprised. That's actually not so bad. If you go back to the Carter and even Reagan administrations  they were rating the other party       . It's not terrible. It drifts downwards very slightly  but now look what happens under George W. Bush and Obama. It plummets. Something is going on here. The moral electromagnet is turning back on  and nowadays  just very recently  Democrats really dislike Republicans. Republicans really dislike the Democrats. We're changing. It's as though the moral electromagnet is affecting us too. It's like put out in the two oceans and it's pulling the whole country apart  pulling left and right into their own territories like the Bloods and the Crips. Now  there are many reasons why this is happening to us  and many of them we cannot reverse. We will never again have a political class that was forged by the experience of fighting together in World War II against a common enemy. We will never again have just three television networks  all of which are relatively centrist. And we will never again have a large group of conservative southern Democrats and liberal northern Republicans making it easy  making there be a lot of overlap for bipartisan cooperation. So for a lot of reasons  those decades after the Second World War were an historically anomalous time. We will never get back to those low levels of polarization  I believe. But there's a lot that we can do. There are dozens and dozens of reforms we can do that will make things better  because a lot of our dysfunction can be traced directly to things that Congress did to itself in the     s that created a much more polarized and dysfunctional institution. These changes are detailed in many books. These are two that I strongly recommend  and they list a whole bunch of reforms. I'm just going to group them into three broad classes here. So if you think about this as the problem of a dysfunctional  hyper polarized institution  well  the first step is  do what you can so that fewer hyper partisans get elected in the first place  and when you have closed party primaries  and only the most committed Republicans and Democrats are voting  you're nominating and selecting the most extreme hyper partisans. So open primaries would make that problem much  much less severe. But the problem isn't primarily that we're electing bad people to Congress. From my experience  and from what I've heard from Congressional insiders  most of the people going to Congress are good  hard working  intelligent people who really want to solve problems  but once they get there  they find that they are forced to play a game that rewards hyper partisanship and that punishes independent thinking. You step out of line  you get punished. So there are a lot of reforms we could do that will counteract this. For example  this  Citizens United  ruling is a disaster  because it means there's like a money gun aimed at your head  and if you step out of line  if you try to reach across the aisle  there's a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent to make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising. But the third class of reforms is that we've got to change the nature of social relationships in Congress. The politicians I've met are generally very extroverted  friendly  very socially skillful people  and that's the nature of politics. You've got to make relationships  make deals  you've got to cajole  please  flatter  you've got to use your personal skills  and that's the way politics has always worked. But beginning in the     s  first the House of Representatives changed its legislative calendar so that all business is basically done in the middle of the week. Nowadays  Congressmen fly in on Tuesday morning  they do battle for two days  then they fly home Thursday afternoon. They don't move their families to the District. They don't meet each other's spouses or children. There's no more relationship there. And trying to run Congress without human relationships is like trying to run a car without motor oil. Should we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up and descends into paralysis and polarization  A simple change to the legislative calendar  such as having business stretch out for three weeks and then they get a week off to go home  that would change the fundamental relationships in Congress. So there's a lot we can do  but who's going to push them to do it  There are a number of groups that are working on this. No Labels and Common Cause  I think  have very good ideas for changes we need to do to make our democracy more responsive and our Congress more effective. But I'd like to supplement their work with a little psychological trick  and the trick is this. Nothing pulls people together like a common threat or a common attack  especially an attack from a foreign enemy  unless of course that threat hits on our polarized psychology  in which case  as I said before  it can actually pull us apart. Sometimes a single threat can polarize us  as we saw. But what if the situation we face is not a single threat but is actually more like this  where there's just so much stuff coming in  it's just   Start shooting  come on  everybody  we've got to just work together  just start shooting.  Because actually  we do face this situation. This is where we are as a country. So here's another asteroid. We've all seen versions of this graph  right  which shows the changes in wealth since       and as you can see  almost all the gains in wealth have gone to the top    percent  and especially the top one percent. Rising inequality like this is associated with so many problems for a democracy. Especially  it destroys our ability to trust each other  to feel that we're all in the same boat  because it's obvious we're not. Some of us are sitting there safe and sound in gigantic private yachts. Other people are clinging to a piece of driftwood. We're not all in the same boat  and that means nobody's willing to sacrifice for the common good. The left has been screaming about this asteroid for    years now  and the right says   Huh  what  Hmm  No problem. No problem.  Now  why is that happening to us  Why is the inequality rising  Well  one of the largest causes  after globalization  is actually this fourth asteroid  rising non marital births. This graph shows the steady rise of out of wedlock births since the     s. Most Hispanic and black children are now born to unmarried mothers. Whites are headed that way too. Within a decade or two  most American children will be born into homes with no father. This means that there's much less money coming into the house. But it's not just money. It's also stability versus chaos. As I know from working with street children in Brazil  Mom's boyfriend is often a really  really dangerous person for kids. Now the right has been screaming about this asteroid since the     s  and the left has been saying   It's not a problem. It's not a problem.  The left has been very reluctant to say that marriage is actually good for women and for children. Now let me be clear. I'm not blaming the women here. I'm actually more critical of the men who won't take responsibility for their own children and of an economic system that makes it difficult for many men to earn enough money to support those children. But even if you blame nobody  it still is a national problem  and one side has been more concerned about it than the other. The New York Times finally noticed this asteroid with a front page story last July showing how the decline of marriage contributes to inequality. We are becoming a nation of just two classes. When Americans go to college and marry each other  they have very low divorce rates. They earn a lot of money  they invest that money in their kids  some of them become tiger mothers  the kids rise to their full potential  and the kids go on to become the top two lines in this graph. And then there's everybody else  the children who don't benefit from a stable marriage  who don't have as much invested in them  who don't grow up in a stable environment  and who go on to become the bottom three lines in that graph. So once again  we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing. As before  we've got a problem  we've got to start working on this  we've got to do something  and what's wrong with you people that you don't see my threat  But if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders  we'd see that these two problems actually are best addressed together. Because if you really care about income inequality  you might want to talk to some evangelical Christian groups that are working on ways to promote marriage. But then you're going to run smack into the problem that women don't generally want to marry someone who doesn't have a job. So if you really care about strengthening families  you might want to talk to some liberal groups who are working on promoting educational equality  who are working on raising the minimum wage  who are working on finding ways to stop so many men from being sucked into the criminal justice system and taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives. So to conclude  there are at least four asteroids headed our way. How many of you can see all four  Please raise your hand right now if you're willing to admit that all four of these are national problems. Please raise your hands. Okay  almost all of you. Well  congratulations  you guys are the inaugural members of the Asteroids Club  which is a club for all Americans who are willing to admit that the other side actually might have a point. In the Asteroids Club  we don't start by looking for common ground. Common ground is often very hard to find. No  we start by looking for common threats because common threats make common ground. Now  am I being naive  Is it naive to think that people could ever lay down their swords  and left and right could actually work together  I don't think so  because it happens  not all that often  but there are a variety of examples that point the way. This is something we can do. Because Americans on both sides care about the decline in civility  and they've formed dozens of organizations  at the national level  such as this one  down to many local organizations  such as To The Village Square in Tallahassee  Florida  which tries to bring state leaders together to help facilitate that sort of working together human relationship that's necessary to solve Florida's problems. Americans on both sides care about global poverty and AIDS  and on so many humanitarian issues  liberals and evangelicals are actually natural allies  and at times they really have worked together to solve these problems. And most surprisingly to me  they sometimes can even see eye to eye on criminal justice. For example  the incarceration rate  the prison population in this country has quadrupled since     . Now this is a social disaster  and liberals are very concerned about this. The Southern Poverty Law Center is often fighting the prison industrial complex  fighting to prevent a system that's just sucking in more and more poor young men. But are conservatives happy about this  Well  Grover Norquist isn't  because this system costs an unbelievable amount of money. And so  because the prison industrial complex is bankrupting our states and corroding our souls  groups of fiscal conservatives and Christian conservatives have come together to form a group called Right on Crime. And at times they have worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center to oppose the building of new prisons and to work for reforms that will make the justice system more efficient and more humane. So this is possible. We can do it. Let us therefore go to battle stations  not to fight each other  but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids. And let our first mission be to press Congress to reform itself  before it's too late for our nation. Thank you.  Applause  It's wonderful to be here to talk about my journey  to talk about the wheelchair and the freedom it has bought me. I started using a wheelchair    years ago when an extended illness changed the way I could access the world. When I started using the wheelchair  it was a tremendous new freedom. I'd seen my life slip away and become restricted. It was like having an enormous new toy. I could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again. Just being out on the street was exhilarating. But even though I had this newfound joy and freedom  people's reaction completely changed towards me. It was as if they couldn't see me anymore  as if an invisibility cloak had descended. They seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair. When I asked people their associations with the wheelchair  they used words like  limitation    fear    pity  and  restriction.  I realized I'd internalized these responses and it had changed who I was on a core level. A part of me had become alienated from myself. I was seeing myself not from my perspective  but vividly and continuously from the perspective of other people's responses to me. As a result  I knew I needed to make my own stories about this experience  new narratives to reclaim my identity.   Finding Freedom  'By creating our own stories we learn to take the texts of our lives as seriously as we do 'official' narratives.'   Davis       TEDx Women   I started making work that aimed to communicate something of the joy and freedom I felt when using a wheelchair    a power chair    to negotiate the world. I was working to transform these internalized responses  to transform the preconceptions that had so shaped my identity when I started using a wheelchair  by creating unexpected images. The wheelchair became an object to paint and play with. When I literally started leaving traces of my joy and freedom  it was exciting to see the interested and surprised responses from people. It seemed to open up new perspectives  and therein lay the paradigm shift. It showed that an arts practice can remake one's identity and transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar. So when I began to dive  in       I realized scuba gear extends your range of activity in just the same way as a wheelchair does  but the associations attached to scuba gear are ones of excitement and adventure  completely different to people's responses to the wheelchair. So I thought   I wonder what'll happen if I put the two together    Laughter   Applause  And the underwater wheelchair that has resulted has taken me on the most amazing journey over the last seven years. So to give you an idea of what that's like  I'd like to share with you one of the outcomes from creating this spectacle  and show you what an amazing journey it's taken me on. It is the most amazing experience  beyond most other things I've experienced in life. I literally have the freedom to move in     degrees of space and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom. And the incredibly unexpected thing is that other people seem to see and feel that too. Their eyes literally light up  and they say things like   I want one of those   or   If you can do that  I can do anything.  And I'm thinking  it's because in that moment of them seeing an object they have no frame of reference for  or so transcends the frames of reference they have with the wheelchair  they have to think in a completely new way. And I think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people's lives. For me  this means that they're seeing the value of difference  the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation  we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives. For me  the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation. In fact  I now call the underwater wheelchair  Portal   because it's literally pushed me through into a new way of being  into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness. And the other thing is  that because nobody's seen or heard of an underwater wheelchair before  and creating this spectacle is about creating new ways of seeing  being and knowing  now you have this concept in your mind. You're all part of the artwork too. Hello. My name is Jarrett Krosoczka  and I write and illustrate books for children for a living. So I use my imagination as my full time job. But well before my imagination was my vocation  my imagination saved my life. When I was a kid  I loved to draw  and the most talented artist I knew was my mother  but my mother was addicted to heroin. And when your parent is a drug addict  it's kind of like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football  because as much as you want to love on that person  as much as you want to receive love from that person  every time you open your heart  you end up on your back. So throughout my childhood  my mother was incarcerated and I didn't have my father because I didn't even learn his first name until I was in the sixth grade. But I had my grandparents  my maternal grandparents Joseph and Shirley  who adopted me just before my third birthday and took me in as their own  after they had already raised five children. So two people who grew up in the Great Depression  there in the very  very early '  s took on a new kid. I was the Cousin Oliver of the sitcom of the Krosoczka family  the new kid who came out of nowhere. And I would like to say that life was totally easy with them. They each smoked two packs a day  each  nonfiltered  and by the time I was six  I could order a Southern Comfort Manhattan  dry with a twist  rocks on the side  the ice on the side so you could fit more liquor in the drink. But they loved the hell out of me. They loved me so much. And they supported my creative efforts  because my grandfather was a self made man. He ran and worked in a factory. My grandmother was a homemaker. But here was this kid who loved Transformers and Snoopy and the Ninja Turtles  and the characters that I read about  I fell in love with  and they became my friends. So my best friends in life were the characters I read about in books. I went to Gates Lane Elementary School in Worcester  Massachusetts  and I had wonderful teachers there  most notably in first grade Mrs. Alisch. And I just  I can just remember the love that she offered us as her students. When I was in the third grade  a monumental event happened. An author visited our school  Jack Gantos. A published author of books came to talk to us about what he did for a living. And afterwards  we all went back to our classrooms and we drew our own renditions of his main character  Rotten Ralph. And suddenly the author appeared in our doorway  and I remember him sort of sauntering down the aisles  going from kid to kid looking at the desks  not saying a word. But he stopped next to my desk  and he tapped on my desk  and he said   Nice cat.   Laughter  And he wandered away. Two words that made a colossal difference in my life. When I was in the third grade  I wrote a book for the first time   The Owl Who Thought He Was The Best Flyer.   Laughter  We had to write our own Greek myth  our own creation story  so I wrote a story about an owl who challenged Hermes to a flying race  and the owl cheated  and Hermes  being a Greek god  grew angry and bitter  and turned the owl into a moon  so the owl had to live the rest of his life as a moon while he watched his family and friends play at night. Yeah.  Laughter  My book had a title page. I was clearly worried about my intellectual property when I was eight. And it was a story that was told with words and pictures  exactly what I do now for a living  and I sometimes let the words have the stage on their own  and sometimes I allowed the pictures to work on their own to tell the story. My favorite page is the  About the author  page. So I learned to write about myself in third person at a young age. So I love that last sentence   He liked making this book.  And I liked making that book because I loved using my imagination  and that's what writing is. Writing is using your imagination on paper  and I do get so scared because I travel to so many schools now and that seems like such a foreign concept to kids  that writing would be using your imagination on paper  if they're allowed to even write now within the school hours. So I loved writing so much that I'd come home from school  and I would take out pieces of paper  and I would staple them together  and I would fill those blank pages with words and pictures just because I loved using my imagination. And so these characters would become my friends. There was an egg  a tomato  a head of lettuce and a pumpkin  and they all lived in this refrigerator city  and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house that was filled with so many dangers like an evil blender who tried to chop them up  an evil toaster who tried to kidnap the bread couple  and an evil microwave who tried to melt their friend who was a stick of butter.  Laughter  And I'd make my own comics too  and this was another way for me to tell stories  through words and through pictures. Now when I was in sixth grade  the public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets in the Worcester public school system. I went from having art once a week to twice a month to once a month to not at all. And my grandfather  he was a wise man  and he saw that as a problem  because he knew that was  like  the one thing I had. I didn't play sports. I had art. So he walked into my room one evening  and he sat on the edge of my bed  and he said   Jarrett  it's up to you  but if you'd like to  we'd like to send you to the classes at the Worcester Art Museum.  And I was so thrilled. So from sixth through   th grade  once  twice  sometimes three times a week  I would take classes at the art museum  and I was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw  other kids who shared a similar passion. Now my publishing career began when I designed the cover for my eighth grade yearbook  and if you're wondering about the style of dress I put our mascot in  I was really into Bell Biv DeVoe and MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice at the time.  Laughter  And to this day  I still can do karaoke to  Ice  Ice Baby  without looking at the screen. Don't tempt me  because I will do it. So I get shipped off to private school  K through eight  public schools  but for some reason my grandfather was upset that somebody at the local high school had been stabbed and killed  so he didn't want me to go there. He wanted me to go to a private school  and he gave me an option. You can go to Holy Name  which is coed  or St. John's  which is all boys. Very wise man  because he knew I would  I felt like I was making the decision on my own  and he knew I wouldn't choose St. John's  so I went to Holy Name High School  which was a tough transition because  like I said  I didn't play sports  and it was very focused on sports  but I took solace in Mr. Shilale's art room. And I just flourished here. I just couldn't wait to get to that classroom every day. So how did I make friends  I drew funny pictures of my teachers     Laughter     and I passed them around. Well  in English class  in ninth grade  my friend John  who was sitting next to me  laughed a little bit too hard. Mr. Greenwood was not pleased. He instantly saw that I was the cause of the commotion  and for the first time in my life  I was sent to the hall  and I thought   Oh no  I'm doomed. My grandfather's just going to kill me.  And he came out to the hallway and he said   Let me see the paper.  And I thought   Oh no. He thinks it's a note.  And so I took this picture  and I handed it to him. And we sat in silence for that brief moment  and he said to me   You're really talented.   Laughter   You're really good. You know  the school newspaper needs a new cartoonist  and you should be the cartoonist. Just stop drawing in my class.  So my parents never found out about it. I didn't get in trouble. I was introduced to Mrs. Casey  who ran the school newspaper  and I was for three and a half years the cartoonist for my school paper  handling such heavy issues as  seniors are mean  freshmen are nerds  the prom bill is so expensive. I can't believe how much it costs to go to the prom. And I took the headmaster to task and then I also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named Wesley who was unlucky in love  and I just swore up and down that this wasn't about me  but all these years later it was totally me. But it was so cool because I could write these stories  I could come up with these ideas  and they'd be published in the school paper  and people who I didn't know could read them. And I loved that thought  of being able to share my ideas through the printed page. On my   th birthday  my grandfather and my grandmother gave me the best birthday present ever  a drafting table that I have worked on ever since. Here I am     years later  and I still work on this table every day. On the evening of my   th birthday  I was given this table  and we had Chinese food. And this was my fortune   You will be successful in your work.  I taped it to the top left hand of my table  and as you can see  it's still there. Now I never really asked my grandparents for anything. Well  two things  Rusty  who was a great hamster and lived a great long life when I was in fourth grade. And a video camera. I just wanted a video camera. And after begging and pleading for Christmas  I got a second hand video camera  and I instantly started making my own animations on my own  and all throughout high school I made my own animations. I convinced my   th grade English teacher to allow me to do my book report on Stephen King's  Misery  as an animated short.  Laughter  And I kept making comics. I kept making comics  and at the Worcester Art Museum  I was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator I was ever given. Mark Lynch  he's an amazing teacher and he's still a dear friend of mine  and I was    or     and I walked into his comic book class halfway through the course  and I was so excited  I was beaming. I had this book that was how to draw comics in the Marvel way  and it taught me how to draw superheroes  how to draw a woman  how to draw muscles just the way they were supposed to be if I were to ever draw for X Men or Spiderman. And all the color just drained from his face  and he looked at me  and he said   Forget everything you learned.  And I didn't understand. He said   You have a great style. Celebrate your own style. Don't draw the way you're being told to draw. Draw the way you're drawing and keep at it  because you're really good.  Now when I was a teenager  I was angsty as any teenager was  but after    years of having a mother who was in and out of my life like a yo yo and a father who was faceless  I was angry. And when I was     I met my father for the first time  upon which I learned I had a brother and sister I had never known about. And on the day I met my father for the first time  I was rejected from the Rhode Island School of Design  my one and only choice for college. But it was around this time I went to Camp Sunshine to volunteer a week and working with the most amazing kids  kids with leukemia  and this kid Eric changed my life. Eric didn't live to see his sixth birthday  and Eric lives with me every day. So after this experience  my art teacher  Mr. Shilale  he brought in these picture books  and I thought   Picture books for kids   and I started writing books for young readers when I was a senior in high school. Well  I eventually got to the Rhode Island School of Design. I transferred to RISD as a sophomore  and it was there that I took every course that I could on writing  and it was there that I wrote a story about a giant orange slug who wanted to be friends with this kid. The kid had no patience for him. And I sent this book out to a dozen publishers and it was rejected every single time  but I was also involved with the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp  an amazing camp for kids with all sorts of critical illnesses  and it's those kids at the camp that read my stories  and I read to them  and I saw that they responded to my work. I graduated from RISD. My grandparents were very proud  and I moved to Boston  and I set up shop. I set up a studio and I tried to get published. I would send out my books. I would send out hundreds of postcards to editors and art directors  but they would go unanswered. And my grandfather would call me every week  and he would say   Jarrett  how's it going  Do you have a job yet   Because he had just invested a significant amount of money in my college education. And I said   Yes  I have a job. I write and illustrate children's books.  And he said   Well  who pays you for that   And I said   No one  no one  no one just yet. But I know it's going to happen.  Now  I used to work the weekends at the Hole in the Wall off season programming to make some extra money as I was trying to get my feet off the ground  and this kid who was just this really hyper kid  I started calling him  Monkey Boy   and I went home and wrote a book called  Good Night  Monkey Boy.  And I sent out one last batch of postcards. And I received an email from an editor at Random House with a subject line   Nice work   Exclamation point.  Dear Jarrett  I received your postcard. I liked your art  so I went to your website and I'm wondering if you ever tried writing any of your own stories  because I really like your art and it looks like there are some stories that go with them. Please let me know if you're ever in New York City.  And this was from an editor at Random House Children's Books. So the next week I  happened  to be in New York. And I met with this editor  and I left New York for a contract for my first book   Good Night  Monkey Boy   which was published on June         . And my local paper celebrated the news. The local bookstore made a big deal of it. They sold out of all of their books. My friend described it as a wake  but happy  because everyone I ever knew was there in line to see me  but I wasn't dead. I was just signing books. My grandparents  they were in the middle of it. They were so happy. They couldn't have been more proud. Mrs. Alisch was there. Mr. Shilale was there. Mrs. Casey was there. Mrs. Alisch cut in front of the line and said   I taught him how to read.   Laughter  And then something happened that changed my life. I got my first piece of significant fan mail  where this kid loved Monkey Boy so much that he wanted to have a Monkey Boy birthday cake. For a two year old  that is like a tattoo.  Laughter  You know  You only get one birthday per year. And for him  it's only his second. And I got this picture  and I thought   This picture is going to live within his consciousness for his entire life. He will forever have this photo in his family photo albums.  So that photo  since that moment  is framed in front of me while I've worked on all of my books. I have    picture books out.  Punk Farm    Baghead    Ollie the Purple Elephant.  I just finished the ninth book in the  Lunch Lady  series  which is a graphic novel series about a lunch lady who fights crime. I'm expecting the release of a chapter book called  Platypus Police Squad  The Frog Who Croaked.  And I travel the country visiting countless schools  letting lots of kids know that they draw great cats. And I meet Bagheads. Lunch ladies treat me really well. And I got to see my name in lights because kids put my name in lights. Twice now  the  Lunch Lady  series has won the Children's Choice Book of the Year in the third or fourth grade category  and those winners were displayed on a jumbotron screen in Times Square.  Punk Farm  and  Lunch Lady  are in development to be movies  so I am a movie producer and I really do think  thanks to that video camera I was given in ninth grade. I've seen people have  Punk Farm  birthday parties  people have dressed up as  Punk Farm  for Halloween  a  Punk Farm  baby room  which makes me a little nervous for the child's well being in the long term. And I get the most amazing fan mail  and I get the most amazing projects  and the biggest moment for me came last Halloween. The doorbell rang and it was a trick or treater dressed as my character. It was so cool. Now my grandparents are no longer living  so to honor them  I started a scholarship at the Worcester Art Museum for kids who are in difficult situations but whose caretakers can't afford the classes. And it displayed the work from my first    years of publishing  and you know who was there to celebrate  Mrs. Alisch. I said   Mrs. Alisch  how are you   And she responded with   I'm here.   Laughter  That's true. You are alive  and that's pretty good right now. So the biggest moment for me  though  my most important job now is I am a dad myself  and I have two beautiful daughters  and my goal is to surround them by inspiration  by the books that are in every single room of our house to the murals I painted in their rooms to the moments for creativity where you find  in quiet times  by making faces on the patio to letting her sit in the very desk that I've sat in for the past    years. Thank you.  Applause  I'd like to share with you the story of one of my patients called Celine. Celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district of Cameroon in west Central Africa. Six years ago  at the time of her HIV diagnosis  she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial which was running in her health district at the time. When I first met Celine  a little over a year ago  she had gone for    months without any antiretroviral therapy  and she was very ill. She told me that she stopped coming to the clinic when the trial ended because she had no money for the bus fare and was too ill to walk the    kilometer distance. Now during the clinical trial  she'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge  and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds. All of these ended once the trial was completed  leaving Celine with no alternatives. She was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she'd received during the trial  or even what the trial had been about. I didn't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue. Yet what puzzled me most was Celine had given her informed consent to be a part of this trial  yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a participant or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed. Now  I have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted. Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results. Maybe it even got published in a high profile scientific journal. Maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the clinical management of HIV patients. But it would have done so at a price to hundreds of patients who  like Celine  were left to their own devices once the research had been completed. I do not stand here today to suggest in any way that conducting HIV clinical trials in developing countries is bad. On the contrary  clinical trials are extremely useful tools  and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries. However  the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation  especially in the context of externally funded research. Sadly enough  the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer countries which fund the research. I'm sure you must be asking yourselves what makes developing countries  especially those in sub Saharan Africa  so attractive for these HIV clinical trials  Well  in order for a clinical trial to generate valid and widely applicable results  they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants and preferably on a population with a high incidence of new HIV infections. Sub Saharan Africa largely fits this description  with    million people living with HIV  an estimated    percent of the    million people who are infected worldwide. Also  research within the continent is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty  endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems. A clinical trial that is considered to be potentially beneficial to the population is more likely to be authorized  and in the absence of good health care systems  almost any offer of medical assistance is accepted as better than nothing. Even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation  less rigorous ethical reviews  and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure. As funding for HIV research increases in developing countries and ethical review in richer countries become more strict  you can see why this context becomes very  very attractive. The high prevalence of HIV drives researchers to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable but on many levels ethically questionable. How then can we ensure that  in our search for the cure  we do not take an unfair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pandemic  I invite you to consider four areas I think we can focus on in order to improve the way in which things are done. The first of these is informed consent. Now  in order for a clinical trial to be considered ethically acceptable  participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand  and must freely consent to participate in the trial. This is especially important in developing countries  where a lot of participants consent to research because they believe it is the only way in which they can receive medical care or other benefits. Consent procedures that are used in richer countries are often inappropriate or ineffective in a lot of developing countries. For example  it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant  like Celine  sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read  let alone understand. Local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials  as well as the incentives for participation. The information in these trials needs to be given to the potential participants in linguistically and culturally acceptable formats. The second point I would like for you to consider is the standard of care that is provided to participants within any clinical trial. Now  this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy. Should the control group in the clinical trial be given the best current treatment which is available anywhere in the world  Or should they be given an alternative standard of care  such as the best current treatment available in the country in which the research is being conducted  Is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen which may not be affordable or accessible to the study participants once the research has been completed  Now  in a situation where the best current treatment is inexpensive and simple to deliver  the answer is straightforward. However  the best current treatment available anywhere in the world is often very difficult to provide in developing countries. It is important to assess the potential risks and benefits of the standard of care which is to be provided to participants in any clinical trial  and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study and most beneficial for the participants within the study. That brings us to the third point I want you think about  the ethical review of research. An effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants within any clinical trial. Unfortunately  this is often lacking or inefficient in a lot of developing countries. Local governments need to set up effective systems for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials which are authorized in different developing countries  and they need to do this by setting up ethical review committees that are independent of the government and research sponsors. Public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and international organizations as appropriate. The final point I would like for you to consider tonight is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed. I think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin in the first place without a clear plan for what would happen to the participants once the trial has ended. Now  researchers need to make every effort to ensure that an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial during a clinical trial is accessible to the participants of the trial once the trial has been completed. In addition  they should be able to consider the possibility of introducing and maintaining effective treatments in the wider community once the trial ends. If  for any reason  they feel that this might not be possible  then I think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place. Now  fortunately for Celine  our meeting did not end in my office. I was able to get her enrolled into a free HIV treatment program closer to her home  and with a support group to help her cope. Her story has a positive ending  but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortunate. Although she may not know this  my encounter with Celine has completely changed the way in which I view HIV clinical trials in developing countries  and made me even more determined to be part of the movement to change the way in which things are done. I believe that every single person listening to me tonight can be part of that change. If you are a researcher  I hold you to a higher standard of moral conscience  to remain ethical in your research  and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers. If you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company  I challenge you to hold your employers to fund research that is ethically sound. If you come from a developing country like myself  I urge you to hold your government to a more thorough review of the clinical trials which are authorized in your country. Yes  there is a need for us to find a cure for HIV  to find an effective vaccine for malaria  to find a diagnostic tool that works for T.B.  but I believe that we owe it to those who willingly and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials to do this in a humane way. Thank you. I was sitting with my girls  and Joy said   Dang  I wish he'd get off my back. My daddy  he calls me all the time.   Lucky for you he calls at all   said Jasmine.  I haven't heard from my dad in years.  At this moment  I knew the girls needed a way to connect with their fathers. At Camp Diva  my non profit organization  we have these types of conversations all the time as a way to help girls of African descent prepare for their passage into womanhood. These girls just needed a way to invite their fathers into their lives on their own terms. So I asked the girls   How can we help other girls develop healthy relationships with their fathers    Let's have a dance   one girl shouted  and all the girls quickly backed her up. They started dreaming about the decorations  invitations  the dresses they were going to wear  and what their fathers could and could not wear.  Laughter  It was off and running before I could even blink my eyes  but even if I could have slowed down those girls  I wouldn't have  because one thing that I have learned from over a decade of working with girls is that they already know what they need. The wisdom lives inside of them. As long as they have infrastructure  mentorship and resources  they can build what they need  not only to survive  but to thrive. So we had a dance  and girls and their fathers came in multitudes. They were dressed to the nines. They acted sweet. They acted silly. They really enjoyed each other's company. It was a huge success. And the girls decided to make it an annual event. So as the seasons changed  and it was time to plan the dance again  one girl named Brianna spoke up  and she said   My dad can't come to the dance  and this whole thing is making me sad.   Why not   the girls asked.  Because he's in jail   she bravely admitted.  Well  can he just get out for a day   one of the girls asked.  Laughter   And come in shackles  That's worse than not having him here at all.  At this moment  I saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion and to become their own heroes. So I asked   What do you think we should do about this  We want every girl to experience the dance  right   So the girls thought for a moment  and one girl suggested   Why don't we just take the dance in the jail   Most of the girls doubted the possibility of that  and said   Are you crazy  Who is going to allow a bunch of little girls  dressed up      Laughter      to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in Spongebob suits   Because that's what they called them. I said   Girls  well  well  you never know unless you ask.  So a letter was written to the Richmond City Sheriff  signed collectively by each girl  and I would have to say  he is a very special sheriff. He contacted me immediately and said  whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside  his doors are always open. Because one thing he did know  that when fathers are connected to their children  it is less likely that they will return. So     inmates and    girls were invited. The girls were dressed in their Sunday best  and the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits for shirts and ties. They hugged. They shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish. They laughed together. It was beautiful. The fathers and daughters even experienced an opportunity to have a physical connection  something that a lot of them didn't even have for a while. Fathers were in a space where they were able to make their daughters play  and pull out her chair and extend his hand for a dance. Even the guards cried. But after the dance  we all realized that Dad still would be in jail. So we needed to create something that they could take with them. So we brought in Flip cams  and we had them look at the Flip cams and just interview each other    their messages  their thoughts. This was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other and feel disconnected  they could reconnect through this image. I'll never forget that one girl looked in her father's eyes with that camera and said   Daddy  when you look at me  what do you see   Because our daddies are our mirrors that we reflect back on when we decide about what type of man we deserve  and how they see us for the rest of our lives. I know that very well  because I was one of the lucky girls. I have had my father in my life always. He's even here today. And that is why it is extremely special for me to make sure that these girls are connected to their fathers  especially those who are separated because of barbed wires and metal doors. We have just created a form for girls who have heavy questions on their heart to be in a position to ask their fathers those questions and given the fathers the freedom to answer. Because we know that the fathers are even leaving with this one thought  What type of woman am I preparing to put in the world  Because a father is locked in does not mean he should be locked out of his daughter's life. It's a great time to be a molecular biologist.  Laughter  Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier and cheaper. By the end of this year  we'll be able to sequence the three million bits of information in your genome in less than a day and for less than       euros. Biotech is probably the most powerful and the fastest growing technology sector. It has the power  potentially  to replace our fossil fuels  to revolutionize medicine  and to touch every aspect of our daily lives. So who gets to do it  I think we'd all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it. But what about that guy   Laughter  In       I first heard about DIYbio. It's a movement that    it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone  not just scientists and people in government labs. The idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate  it could really stimulate innovation. Putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they've got the best idea of what their needs are. And here's this really sophisticated technology coming down the road  all these associated social  moral  ethical questions  and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we're doing in those labs. So wouldn't it be nice if there was a place in your local neighborhood where you could go and learn about this stuff  do it hands on  I thought so. So  three years ago  I got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded Genspace. It's a nonprofit  a community biotech lab in Brooklyn  New York  and the idea was people could come  they could take classes and putter around in the lab in a very open  friendly atmosphere. None of my previous experience prepared me for what came next. Can you guess  The press started calling us. And the more we talked about how great it was to increase science literacy  the more they wanted to talk about us creating the next Frankenstein  and as a result  for the next six months  when you Googled my name  instead of getting my scientific papers  you got this.   Am I a biohazard    It was pretty depressing. The only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world  there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were. They were opening biohacker spaces  and some of them were facing much greater challenges than we did  more regulations  less resources. But now  three years later  here's where we stand. It's a vibrant  global community of hackerspaces  and this is just the beginning. These are some of the biggest ones  and there are others opening every day. There's one probably going to open up in Moscow  one in South Korea  and the cool thing is they each have their own individual flavor that grew out of the community they came out of. Let me take you on a little tour. Biohackers work alone. We work in groups  in big cities    Laughter    and in small villages. We reverse engineer lab equipment. We genetically engineer bacteria. We hack hardware  software  wetware  and  of course  the code of life. We like to build things. Then we like to take things apart. We make things grow. We make things glow. And we make cells dance. The spirit of these labs  it's open  it's positive  but  you know  sometimes when people think of us  the first thing that comes to mind is bio safety  bio security  all the dark side stuff. I'm not going to minimize those concerns. Any powerful technology is inherently dual use  and  you know  you get something like synthetic biology  nanobiotechnology  it really compels you  you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups  because they have better infrastructure  they have better facilities  and they have access to pathogens. So the United Nations did just that  and they recently issued a report on this whole area  and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative  and they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community  and they noted  not surprisingly  that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics. As a matter of fact  DIY people from all over the world  America  Europe  got together last year  and we hammered out a common code of ethics. That's a lot more than conventional science has done. Now  we follow state and local regulations. We dispose of our waste properly  we follow safety procedures  we don't work with pathogens. You know  if you're working with a pathogen  you're not part of the biohacker community  you're part of the bioterrorist community  I'm sorry. And sometimes people ask me   Well  what about an accident   Well  working with the safe organisms that we normally work with  the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating  like  some sort of superbug  that's literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the Sahara Desert. Now  it could happen  but I'm not going to plan my life around it. I've actually chosen to take a different kind of risk. I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project. It's a study at Harvard where  at the end of the study  they're going to take my entire genomic sequence  all of my medical information  and my identity  and they're going to post it online for everyone to see. There were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion. The one I liked the best is  someone could download my sequence  go back to the lab  synthesize some fake Ellen DNA  and plant it at a crime scene.  Laughter  But like DIYbio  the positive outcomes and the potential for good for a study like that far outweighs the risk. Now  you might be asking yourself   Well  you know  what would I do in a biolab   Well  it wasn't that long ago we were asking   Well  what would anyone do with a personal computer   So this stuff is just beginning. We're only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg. Let me show you what you could do right now. A biohacker in Germany  a journalist  wanted to know whose dog was leaving little presents on his street  Yep  you guessed it. He threw tennis balls to all the neighborhood dogs  analyzed the saliva  identified the dog  and confronted the dog owner. I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard. Looked like a ladybug  right  It actually is a Japanese beetle. And the same kind of technology    it's called DNA barcoding  it's really cool    You can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga  if that sushi is really tuna  or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat's. In a biohacker space  you can analyze your genome for mutations. You can analyze your breakfast cereal for GMO's  and you can explore your ancestry. You can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere  collect microbes  see what's up there. You can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water. You can make some sort of a biofuel cell. You can do a lot of things. You can also do an art science project. Some of these are really spectacular  and they look at social  ecological problems from a completely different perspective. It's really cool. Some people ask me  well  why am I involved  I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science. The thing is  there's something in these labs that they have to offer society that you can't find anywhere else. There's something sacred about a space where you can work on a project  and you don't have to justify to anyone that it's going to make a lot of money  that it's going to save mankind  or even that it's feasible. It just has to follow safety guidelines. If you had spaces like this all over the world  it could really change the perception of who's allowed to do biotech. It's spaces like these that spawned personal computing. Why not personal biotech  If everyone in this room got involved  who knows what we could do  This is such a new area  and as we say back in Brooklyn  you ain't seen nothin' yet.  Laughter  Hi. My name is Cameron Russell  and for the last little while  I've been a model. Actually  for    years. And I feel like there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress. So luckily  I brought an outfit change. This is the first outfit change on the TED stage  so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it  I think. If some of the women were really horrified when I came out  you don't have to tell me now  but I'll find out later on Twitter. I'd also note that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief    seconds. Not everybody gets to do that. These heels are very uncomfortable  so good thing I wasn't going to wear them. The worst part is putting this sweater over my head  because that's when you'll all laugh at me  so don't do anything while it's over my head. All right. So  why did I do that  That was awkward. Well    Hopefully not as awkward as that picture. Image is powerful  but also  image is superficial. I just totally transformed what you thought of me  in six seconds. And in this picture  I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life. I was totally uncomfortable  and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy's hair. And of course  barring surgery  or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work  there's very little that we can do to transform how we look  and how we look  though it is superficial and immutable  has a huge impact on our lives. So today  for me  being fearless means being honest. And I am on this stage because I am a model. I am on this stage because I am a pretty  white woman  and in my industry  we call that a sexy girl. I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me  but with an honest twist. So the first question is  how do you become a model  I always just say   Oh  I was scouted   but that means nothing. The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery  and I am the recipient of a legacy  and maybe you're wondering what is a legacy. Well  for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we're biologically programmed to admire  but also as tall  slender figures  and femininity and white skin. And this is a legacy that was built for me  and it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on. And I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point  and maybe there are some fashionistas who are like   Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen.  And first  I commend you on your model knowledge. Very impressive. But unfortunately  I have to inform you that in       a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the runway  every single one that was hired  and of the     models that were hired  only     or less than four percent  were non white. The next question people always ask is   Can I be a model when I grow up   And the first answer is   I don't know  they don't put me in charge of that.  But the second answer  and what I really want to say to these little girls is   Why  You know  You can be anything. You could be the President of the United States  or the inventor of the next Internet  or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet  which would be awesome  because you'd be the first one.  If  after this amazing list  they still are like   No  no  Cameron  I want to be a model   well  then I say   Be my boss.  Because I'm not in charge of anything  and you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H M  or the next Steven Meisel. Saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up. It's out of your control  and it's awesome  and it's not a career path. I will demonstrate for you now    years of accumulated model knowledge  because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons  it can just be distilled right now. So  if the photographer is right there  the light is right there  like a nice HMI  and the client says   We want a walking shot   this leg goes first  nice and long  this arm goes back  this arm goes forward  the head is at three quarters  and you just go back and forth  just do that  and then you look back at your imaginary friends                times. It will look something like this. Hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle. That was    I don't know what happened there. Unfortunately  after you've gone to school  and you have a r sum  and you've done a few jobs  you can't say anything anymore  so if you say you want to be the President of the United States  but your r sum  reads   Underwear Model     years   people give you a funny look. The next question is   Do they retouch all the photos   And yeah  they pretty much retouch all the photos  but that is only a small component of what's happening. This picture is the very first picture that I ever took  and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini  and I didn't even have my period yet. I know we're getting personal  but I was a young girl. This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier. Here's me on the same day as this shoot. My friend got to come. Here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue. Here's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine. And here's me today. And I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me. They are constructions  and they are constructions by a group of professionals  by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre production and post production  and they build this. That's not me. Okay  so the next question people always ask me is   Do you get free stuff   I do have too many   inch heels which I never get to wear  except for earlier  but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life  and that's what we don't like to talk about. I grew up in Cambridge  and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free. When I was a teenager  I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course  we got pulled over  and all it took was a  Sorry  officer   and we were on our way. And I got these free things because of how I look  not who I am  and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are. I live in New York  and last year  of the         teenagers that were stopped and frisked      of them were black and Latino  and most of them were young men. And there are only         young black and Latino men in New York  so for them  it's not a question of   Will I get stopped   but  How many times will I get stopped  When will I get stopped   When I was researching this talk  I found out that of the    year old girls in the United States      don't like their bodies  and that number goes to     by the time that they're   . So  the last question people ask me is   What is it like to be a model   And I think the answer that they're looking for is   If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair  you will be so happy and fabulous.  And when we're backstage  we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that. We say   It's really amazing to travel  and it's amazing to get to work with creative  inspired  passionate people.  And those things are true  but they're only one half of the story  because the thing that we never say on camera  that I have never said on camera  is   I am insecure.  And I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day. And if you ever are wondering   If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair  will I be happier   you just need to meet a group of models  because they have the thinnest thighs  the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes  and they're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet. When I was writing this talk  I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance  because on the one hand  I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say   Look I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor   and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with   and it doesn't always make me happy.  But mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries. But I'm also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it's great that I got to come before    or    or    years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career  because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job  or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college  which seems so important right now. If there's a takeaway to this talk  I hope it's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures. Thank you. So  before I became a dermatologist  I started in general medicine  as most dermatologists do in Britain. At the end of that time  I went off to Australia  about    years ago. What you learn when you go to Australia is the Australians are very competitive. And they are not magnanimous in victory. And that happened a lot   You pommies  you can't play cricket  rugby.  I could accept that. But moving into work    and we have each week what's called a journal club  when you'd sit down with the other doctors and you'd study a scientific paper in relation to medicine. And after week one  it was about cardiovascular mortality  a dry subject    how many people die of heart disease  what the rates are. And they were competitive about this   You pommies  your rates of heart disease are shocking.  And of course  they were right. Australians have about a third less heart disease than we do    less deaths from heart attacks  heart failure  less strokes    they're generally a healthier bunch. And of course they said this was because of their fine moral standing  their exercise  because they're Australians and we're weedy pommies  and so on. But it's not just Australia that has better health than Britain. Within Britain  there is a gradient of health    and this is what's called standardized mortality  basically your chances of dying. This is looking at data from the paper about    years ago  but it's true today. Comparing your rates of dying    degrees north    that's the South  that's London and places    by latitude  and    degrees    the bad news is that's here  Glasgow. I'm from Edinburgh. Worse news  that's even Edinburgh. So what accounts for this horrible space here between us up here in southern Scotland and the South  Now  we know about smoking  deep fried Mars bars  chips    the Glasgow diet. All of these things. But this graph is after taking into account all of these known risk factors. This is after accounting for smoking  social class  diet  all those other known risk factors. We are left with this missing space of increased deaths the further north you go. Now  sunlight  of course  comes into this. And vitamin D has had a great deal of press  and a lot of people get concerned about it. And we need vitamin D. It's now a requirement that children have a certain amount. My grandmother grew up in Glasgow  back in the     s and '  s when rickets was a real problem and cod liver oil was brought in. And that really prevented the rickets that used to be common in this city. And I as a child was fed cod liver oil by my grandmother. I distinctly    nobody forgets cod liver oil. But an association  The higher people's blood levels of vitamin D are  the less heart disease they have  the less cancer. There seems to be a lot of data suggesting that vitamin D is very good for you. And it is  to prevent rickets and so on. But if you give people vitamin D supplements  you don't change that high rate of heart disease. And the evidence for it preventing cancers is not yet great. So what I'm going to suggest is that vitamin D is not the only story in town. It's not the only reason preventing heart disease. High vitamin D levels  I think  are a marker for sunlight exposure  and sunlight exposure  in methods I'm going to show  is good for heart disease. Anyway  I came back from Australia  and despite the obvious risks to my health  I moved to Aberdeen. Now  in Aberdeen  I started my dermatology training. But I also became interested in research  and in particular I became interested in this substance  nitric oxide. Now these three guys up here  Furchgott  Ignarro and Murad  won the Nobel Prize for medicine back in     . And they were the first people to describe this new chemical transmitter  nitric oxide. What nitric oxide does is it dilates blood vessels  so it lowers your blood pressure. It also dilates the coronary arteries  so it stops angina. And what was remarkable about it was in the past when we think of chemical messengers within the body  we thought of complicated things like estrogen and insulin  or nerve transmission. Very complex processes with very complex chemicals that fit into very complex receptors. And here's this incredibly simple molecule  a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together  and yet these are hugely important for  unclear  our low blood pressure  for neurotransmission  for many  many things  but particularly cardiovascular health. And I started doing research  and we found  very excitingly  that the skin produces nitric oxide. So it's not just in the cardiovascular system it arises. It arises in the skin. Well  having found that and published that  I thought  well  what's it doing  How do you have low blood pressure in your skin  It's not the heart. What do you do  So I went off to the States  as many people do if they're going to do research  and I spent a few years in Pittsburgh. This is Pittsburgh. And I was interested in these really complex systems. We thought that maybe nitric oxide affected cell death  and how cells survive  and their resistance to other things. And I first off started work in cell culture  growing cells  and then I was using knockout mouse models    mice that couldn't make the gene. We worked out a mechanism  which    NO was helping cells survive. And I then moved back to Edinburgh. And in Edinburgh  the experimental animal we use is the medical student. It's a species close to human  with several advantages over mice  They're free  you don't shave them  they feed themselves  and nobody pickets your office saying   Save the lab medical student.  So they're really an ideal model. But what we found was that we couldn't reproduce in man the data we had shown in mice. It seemed we couldn't turn off the production of nitric oxide in the skin of humans. We put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it  we injected things. We couldn't turn off the nitric oxide. And the reason for this  it turned out  after two or three years' work  was that in the skin we have huge stores not of nitric oxide  because nitric oxide is a gas  and it's released     Poof      and in a few seconds it's away  but it can be turned into these forms of nitric oxide    nitrate  NO   nitrite  NO   nitrosothiols. And these are more stable  and your skin has got really large stores of NO. And we then thought to ourselves  with those big stores  I wonder if sunlight might activate those stores and release them from the skin  where the stores are about    times as big as what's in the circulation. Could the sun activate those stores into the circulation  and there in the circulation do its good things for your cardiovascular system  Well  I'm an experimental dermatologist  so what we did was we thought we'd have to expose our experimental animals to sunlight. And so what we did was we took a bunch of volunteers and we exposed them to ultraviolet light. So these are kind of sunlamps. Now  what we were careful to do was  vitamin D is made by ultraviolet B rays and we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin D story. So we used ultraviolet A  which doesn't make vitamin D. When we put people under a lamp for the equivalent of about    minutes of sunshine in summer in Edinburgh  what we produced was  we produced a rise in circulating nitric oxide. So we put patients with these subjects under the UV  and their NO levels do go up  and their blood pressure goes down. Not by much  as an individual level  but enough at a population level to shift the rates of heart disease in a whole population. And when we shone UV at them  or when we warmed them up to the same level as the lamps  but didn't actually let the rays hit the skin  this didn't happen. So this seems to be a feature of ultraviolet rays hitting the skin. Now  we're still collecting data. A few good things here  This appeared to be more marked in older people. I'm not sure exactly how much. One of the subjects here was my mother in law  and clearly I do not know her age. But certainly in people older than my wife  this appears to be a more marked effect. And the other thing I should mention was there was no change in vitamin D. This is separate from vitamin D. So vitamin D is good for you    it stops rickets  it prevents calcium metabolism  important stuff. But this is a separate mechanism from vitamin D. Now  one of the problems with looking at blood pressure is your body does everything it can to keep your blood pressure at the same place. If your leg is chopped off and you lose blood  your body will clamp down  increase the heart rate  do everything it can to keep your blood pressure up. That is an absolutely fundamental physiological principle. So what we've next done is we've moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation. So we've measured    this is again  notice no tail and hairless  this is a medical student. In the arm  you can measure blood flow in the arm by how much it swells up as some blood flows into it. And what we've shown is that doing a sham irradiation    this is the thick line here    this is shining UV on the arm so it warms up but keeping it covered so the rays don't hit the skin. There is no change in blood flow  in dilatation of the blood vessels. But the active irradiation  during the UV and for an hour after it  there is dilation of the blood vessels. This is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure  by which you dilate the coronary arteries also  to let the blood be supplied with the heart. So here  further data that ultraviolet    that's sunlight    has benefits on the blood flow and the cardiovascular system. So we thought we'd just kind of model    Different amounts of UV hit different parts of the Earth at different times of year  so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide    the nitrates  nitrites  nitrosothiols in the skin    cleave to release NO. Different wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that. So you can look at the wavelengths of light that do that. And you can look    So  if you live on the equator  the sun comes straight overhead  it comes through a very thin bit of atmosphere. In winter or summer  it's the same amount of light. If you live up here  in summer the sun is coming fairly directly down  but in winter it's coming through a huge amount of atmosphere  and much of the ultraviolet is weeded out  and the range of wavelengths that hit the Earth are different from summer to winter. So what you can do is you can multiply those data by the NO that's released and you can calculate how much nitric oxide would be released from the skin into the circulation. Now  if you're on the equator here    that's these two lines here  the red line and the purple line    the amount of nitric oxide that's released is the area under the curve  it's the area in this space here. So if you're on the equator  December or June  you've got masses of NO being released from the skin. So Ventura is in southern California. In summer  you might as well be at the equator. It's great. Lots of NO is released. Ventura mid winter  well  there's still a decent amount. Edinburgh in summer  the area beneath the curve is pretty good  but Edinburgh in winter  the amount of NO that can be released is next to nothing  tiny amounts. So what do we think  We're still working at this story  we're still developing it  we're still expanding it. We think it's very important. We think it probably accounts for a lot of the north south health divide within Britain  It's of relevance to us. We think that the skin    well  we know that the skin has got very large stores of nitric oxide as these various other forms. We suspect a lot of these come from diet  green leafy vegetables  beetroot  lettuce has a lot of these nitric oxides that we think go to the skin. We think they're then stored in the skin  and we think the sunlight releases this where it has generally beneficial effects. And this is ongoing work  but dermatologists    I mean  I'm a dermatologist. My day job is saying to people   You've got skin cancer  it's caused by sunlight  don't go in the sun.  I actually think a far more important message is that there are benefits as well as risks to sunlight. Yes  sunlight is the major alterable risk factor for skin cancer  but deaths from heart disease are a hundred times higher than deaths from skin cancer. And I think that we need to be more aware of  and we need to find the risk benefit ratio. How much sunlight is safe  and how can we finesse this best for our general health  So  thank you very much indeed. You know  my favorite part of being a dad is the movies I get to watch. I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids  and when my daughter was four  we got to watch  The Wizard of Oz  together. It totally dominated her imagination for months. Her favorite character was Glinda  of course. It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand. But you watch that movie enough times  and you start to realize how unusual it is. Now we live today  and are raising our children  in a kind of children's fantasy spectacular industrial complex. But  The Wizard of Oz  stood alone. It did not start that trend. Forty years later was when the trend really caught on  with  interestingly  another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards. Do you know what I'm talking about   Laughter  Yeah. Now  there's a big difference between these two movies  a couple of really big differences between  The Wizard of Oz  and all the movies we watch today. One is there's very little violence in  The Wizard of Oz.  The monkeys are rather aggressive  as are the apple trees. But I think if  The Wizard of Oz  were made today  the wizard would say   Dorothy  you are the savior of Oz that the prophecy foretold. Use your magic slippers to defeat the computer generated armies of the Wicked Witch.  But that's not how it happens. Another thing that's really unique about  The Wizard of Oz  to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female. Now I started to notice this when I actually showed  Star Wars  to my daughter  which was years later  and the situation was different. At that point I also had a son. He was only three at the time. He was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that. But he was the second child  and the level of supervision had plummeted.  Laughter  So he wandered in  and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling  and I don't think he understands what's going on  but he is sure soaking in it. And I wonder what he's soaking in. Is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty  Is he picking up on the fact that Luke joins an army to overthrow the government  Is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for Aunt Beru  and of course this princess  who's really cool  but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe  which he does by the magic that he was born with  Compare this to      with  The Wizard of Oz.  How does Dorothy win her movie  By making friends with everybody and being a leader. That's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in    Oz  right     and not the world of dudes fighting  which is where we kind of have to be. Why is there so much Force    capital F  Force    in the movies we have for our kids  and so little yellow brick road  There is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy violent movie has on girls  and you should do that reading. It's very good. I haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe. I know from my own experience that Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context that I could have used in navigating the adult world that is co ed.  Laughter  I think there was a first kiss moment when I really expected the credits to start rolling because that's the end of the movie  right  I finished my quest  I got the girl. Why are you still standing there  I don't know what I'm supposed to do. The movies are very  very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward  and there's not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys. It's almost as though if you're a boy  you are a dopey animal  and if you are a girl  you should bring your warrior costume. There are plenty of exceptions  and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you. But they do send a message to boys  that they are not  the boys are not really the target audience. They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy  but they are not necessarily showing boys how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy. There's no models for them. And we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids  and as three dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are  these are still war movies. And  of course  the most successful studio of all time continues to crank out classic after classic  every single one of them about the journey of a boy  or a man  or two men who are friends  or a man and his son  or two men who are raising a little girl. Until  as many of you are thinking  this year  when they finally came out with  Brave.  I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now. Do you remember what the critics said when  Brave  came out   Aw  I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie.  It's very good. Don't let that stop you. Now  almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test. I don't know if you've heard of this. It has not yet caught on and caught fire  but maybe today we will start a movement. Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist  and back in the mid '  s  she recorded this conversation she'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw. And it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask  Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines  So try to meet that bar. And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie  And is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like   Laughter  Right  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much. Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff. It does happen. I've seen it  and yet I very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love. In fact  this week I went to see a very high quality movie   Argo.  Right  Oscar buzz  doing great at the box office  a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is. It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test. And I don't think it should  because a lot of the movie  I don't know if you've seen it  but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis. We've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep  angst ridden conversations in this hideout  and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say   Are you coming to bed  honey   That's Hollywood for you. So let's look at the numbers.       of the     most popular movies  how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists  Eleven. It's not bad. It's not as many percent as the number of women we've just elected to Congress  so that's good. But there is a number that is greater than this that's going to bring this room down. Last year  The New York Times published a study that the government had done. Here's what it said. One out of five women in America say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life. Now  I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment. I don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that. I don't even think that music videos or pornography are really directly related to that  but something is going wrong  and when I hear that statistic  one of the things I think of is that's a lot of sexual assailants. Who are these guys  What are they learning  What are they failing to learn  Are they absorbing the story that a male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward  which is a woman who has no friends and doesn't speak  Are we soaking up that story  You know  as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing  we find this world and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them. We have tools at our disposal like  girl power   and we hope that that will help  but I gotta wonder  is girl power going to protect them if  at the same time  actively or passively  we are training our sons to maintain their boy power  I mean  I think the Netflix queue is one way that we can do something very important  and I'm talking mainly to the dads here. I think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood. The definition of manhood is already turning upside down. You've read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner. They're throwing it up in the air. So our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this  some new relationship with each other  and I think we really have to show them  and model for them  how a real man is someone who trusts his sisters and respects them  and wants to be on their team  and stands up against the real bad guys  who are the men who want to abuse the women. And I think our job in the Netflix queue is to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test  if we can find them  and to seek out the heroines who are there  who show real courage  who bring people together  and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines and to say   I want to be on their team   because they're going to be on their team. When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in  Star Wars   do you know what she said  Obi Wan. Obi Wan Kenobi and Glinda. What do these two have in common  Maybe it's not just the sparkly dress. I think these people are experts. I think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody else  and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential. Now  they are leaders. I like that kind of quest for my daughter  and I like that kind of quest for my son. I want more quests like that. I want fewer quests where my son is told   Go out and fight it alone   and more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team  maybe a team led by women  to help other people become better and be better people  like the Wizard of Oz. Thank you. This is how war starts. One day you're living your ordinary life  you're planning to go to a party  you're taking your children to school  you're making a dentist appointment. The next thing  the telephones go out  the TVs go out  there's armed men on the street  there's roadblocks. Your life as you know it goes into suspended animation. It stops. I'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine  a Bosnian friend  about what happened to her  because I think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like. She was walking to work one day in April        in a miniskirt and high heels. She worked in a bank. She was a young mother. She was someone who liked to party. Great person. And suddenly she sees a tank ambling down the main road of Sarajevo knocking everything out of its path. She thinks she's dreaming  but she's not. And she runs as any of us would have done and takes cover  and she hides behind a trash bin  in her high heels and her miniskirt. And as she's hiding there  she's feeling ridiculous  but she's seeing this tank go by with soldiers and people all over the place and chaos and she thinks   I feel like Alice in Wonderland going down the rabbit hole  down  down  down into chaos  and my life will never be the same again.  A few weeks later  my friend was in a crowd of people pushing with her infant son in her arms to give him to a stranger on a bus  which was one of the last buses leaving Sarajevo to take children out so they could be safe. And she remembers struggling with her mother to the front  crowds and crowds of people   Take my child  Take my child   and passing her son to someone through a window. And she didn't see him for years. The siege went on for three and a half years  and it was a siege without water  without power  without electricity  without heat  without food  in the middle of Europe  in the middle of the   th century. I had the honor of being one of those reporters that lived through that siege  and I say I have the honor and the privilege of being there because it's taught me everything  not just about being a reporter  but about being a human being. I learned about compassion. I learned about ordinary people who could be heroes. I learned about sharing. I learned about camaraderie. Most of all  I learned about love. Even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos  I learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors  share food  raise their children  drag someone who's being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life  helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take them to hospitals. I learned so much about myself. Martha Gellhorn  who's one of my heroes  once said   You can only love one war. The rest is responsibility.  I went on to cover many  many  many wars after that  so many that I lost count  but there was nothing like Sarajevo. Last April  I went back to a very strange    what I called a deranged high school reunion. What it was  was the   th anniversary of the siege  the beginning of the siege of Sarajevo  and I don't like the word  anniversary   because it sounds like a party  and this was not a party. It was a very somber gathering of the reporters that worked there during the war  humanitarian aid workers  and of course the brave and courageous people of Sarajevo themselves. And the thing that struck me the most  that broke my heart  was walking down the main street of Sarajevo  where my friend Aida saw the tank coming    years ago  and in that road were more than        red chairs  empty  and every single one of them symbolized a person who had died during the siege  just in Sarajevo  not in all of Bosnia  and it stretched from one end of the city to a large part of it  and the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs for the children. I now cover Syria  and I started reporting it because I believed that it needs to be done. I believe a story there has to be told. I see  again  a template of the war in Bosnia. And when I first arrived in Damascus  I saw this strange moment where people didn't seem to believe that war was going to descend  and it was exactly the same in Bosnia and nearly every other country I've seen where war comes. People don't want to believe it's coming  so they don't leave  they don't leave before they can. They don't get their money out. They stay because you want to stay in your home. And then war and chaos descend. Rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot. In       I briefly left Sarajevo to go report the genocide in Rwanda. Between April and August        one million people were slaughtered. Now if those        chairs freaked me out with the sheer number  I want you just for a second to think of a million people. And to give you some example  I remember standing and looking down a road as far as I could see  at least a mile  and there were bodies piled twice my height of the dead. And that was just a small percentage of the dead. And there were mothers holding their children who had been caught in their last death throes. So we learn a lot from war  and I mention Rwanda because it is one place  like South Africa  where nearly    years on  there is healing. Fifty six percent of the parliamentarians are women  which is fantastic  and there's also within the national constitution now  you're actually not allowed to say Hutu or Tutsi. You're not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity  which is  of course  what started the slaughter in the first place. And an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story  or I find it beautiful. There was a group of children  mixed Hutus and Tutsis  and a group of women who were adopting them  and they lined up and one was just given to the next. There was no kind of compensation for  you're a Tutsi  you're a Hutu  you might have killed my mother  you might have killed my father. They were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation  and I find this remarkable. So when people ask me how I continue to cover war  and why I continue to do it  this is why. When I go back to Syria  next week in fact  what I see is incredibly heroic people  some of them fighting for democracy  for things we take for granted every single day. And that's pretty much why I do it. In       I had a little baby boy  and I call him my miracle child  because after seeing so much death and destruction and chaos and darkness in my life  this ray of hope was born. And I called him Luca  which means  The bringer of light   because he does bring light to my life. But I'm talking about him because when he was four months old  my foreign editor forced me to go back to Baghdad where I had been reporting all throughout the Saddam regime and during the fall of Baghdad and afterwards  and I remember getting on the plane in tears  crying to be separated from my son  and while I was there  a quite famous Iraqi politician who was a friend of mine said to me   What are you doing here  Why aren't you home with Luca   And I said   Well  I have to see.  It was      which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq   I have to see  I have to see what is happening here. I have to report it.  And he said   Go home  because if you miss his first tooth  if you miss his first step  you'll never forgive yourself. But there will always be another war.  And there  sadly  will always be wars. And I am deluding myself if I think  as a journalist  as a reporter  as a writer  what I do can stop them. I can't. I'm not Kofi Annan. He can't stop a war. He tried to negotiate Syria and couldn't do it. I'm not a U.N. conflict resolution person. I'm not even a humanitarian aid doctor  and I can't tell you the times of how helpless I've felt to have people dying in front of me  and I couldn't save them. All I am is a witness. My role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless. A colleague of mine described it as to shine a light in the darkest corners of the world. And that's what I try to do. I'm not always successful  and sometimes it's incredibly frustrating  because you feel like you're writing into a void  or you feel like no one cares. Who cares about Syria  Who cares about Bosnia  Who cares about the Congo  the Ivory Coast  Liberia  Sierra Leone  all of these strings of places that I will remember for the rest of my life  But my m tier is to bear witness and that is the crux  the heart of the matter  for us reporters who do this. And all I can really do is hope  not to policymakers or politicians  because as much as I'd like to have faith that they read my words and do something  I don't delude myself. But what I do hope is that if you remember anything I said or any of my stories tomorrow morning over breakfast  if you can remember the story of Sarajevo  or the story of Rwanda  then I've done my job. Thank you very much. What I want to do this afternoon is something a little different than what's scheduled. Foreign policy  you can figure that out by watching  I don't know  Rachel Maddow or somebody  but    Laughter    I want to talk about young people and structure  young people and structure. This was last Wednesday afternoon at a school in Brooklyn  New York  at Cristo Rey High School  run by the Jesuits. And I was talking to this group of students  and take a look at them. They were around me in three directions. You'll noticed that almost all of them are minority. You'll notice that the building is rather austere. It's an old New York school building  nothing fancy. They still have old blackboards and whatnot. And there are about     kids in this school  and the school's been going now for four years  and they're about to graduate their first class. Twenty two people are graduating  and all    are going to college. They all come from homes where there is  for the most part  just one person in the home  usually the mother or the grandmother  and that's it  and they come here for their education and for their structure. Now I had this picture taken  and it was put up on my Facebook page last week  and somebody wrote in   Huh  why does he have him standing at attention like that   And then they said   But he looks good.   Laughter  He does look good  because kids need structure  and the trick I play in all of my school appearances is that when I get through with my little homily to the kids  I then invite them to ask questions  and when they raise their hands  I say   Come up   and I make them come up and stand in front of me. I make them stand at attention like a soldier. Put your arms straight down at your side  look up  open your eyes  stare straight ahead  and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear. No slouching  no pants hanging down  none of that stuff. And this young man  his name is    his last name Cruz    he loved it. That's all over his Facebook page and it's gone viral. So people think I'm being unkind to this kid. No  we're having a little fun. And the thing about it  I've done this for years  the younger they are  the more fun it is. When I get six  and seven year olds in a group  I have to figure out how to keep them quiet. You know that they'll always start yakking. And so I play a little game with them before I make them stand at attention. I say   Now listen. In the army  when we want you to pay attention  we have a command. It's called 'at ease.' It means everybody be quiet and pay attention. Listen up. Do you understand    Uh huh  uh huh  uh huh.  Let's practice. Everybody start chatting.  And I let them go for about    seconds  then I go   At ease    Huh    Laughter   Yes  General. Yes  General.  Try it with your kids. See if it works.  Laughter  I don't think so. But anyway  it's a game I play  and it comes obviously from my military experience. Because for the majority of my adult life  I worked with young kids  teenagers with guns  I call them. And we would bring them into the army  and the first thing we would do is to put them in an environment of structure  put them in ranks  make them all wear the same clothes  cut all their hair off so they look alike  make sure that they are standing in ranks. We teach them how to go right face  left face  so they can obey instructions and know the consequences of not obeying instructions. It gives them structure. And then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately  the drill sergeant. And they hate him. And the drill sergeant starts screaming at them  and telling them to do all kinds of awful things. But then the most amazing thing happens over time. Once that structure is developed  once they understand the reason for something  once they understand   Mama ain't here  son. I'm your worst nightmare. I'm your daddy and your mommy. And that's just the way it is. You got that  son  Yeah  and then when I ask you a question  there are only three possible answers  yes  sir  no  sir  and no excuse  sir. Don't start telling me why you didn't do something. It's yes  sir  no  sir  no excuse  sir.   You didn't shave.  But sir     No  don't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning. I'm telling you you didn't shave.   No excuse  sir.  Attaboy  you're learning fast.  But you'd be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure. In    weeks  they have a skill. They are mature. And you know what  they come to admire the drill sergeant and they never forget the drill sergeant. They come to respect him. And so we need more of this kind of structure and respect in the lives of our children. I spend a lot of time with youth groups  and I say to people   When does the education process begin   We're always talking about   Let's fix the schools. Let's do more for our teachers. Let's put more computers in our schools. Let's get it all online.  That isn't the whole answer. It's part of the answer. But the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school with structure in that child's heart and soul to begin with. When does the learning process begin  Does it begin in first grade  No  no  it begins the first time a child in a mother's arms looks up at the mother and says   Oh  this must be my mother. She's the one who feeds me. Oh yeah  when I don't feel so good down there  she takes care of me. It's her language I will learn.  And at that moment they shut out all the other languages that they could be learning at that age  but by three months  that's her. And if the person doing it  whether it's the mother or grandmother  whoever's doing it  that is when the education process begins. That's when language begins. That's when love begins. That's when structure begins. That's when you start to imprint on the child that  you are special  you are different from every other child in the world. And we're going to read to you.  A child who has not been read to is in danger when that child gets to school. A child who doesn't know his or her colors or doesn't know how to tell time  doesn't know how to tie shoes  doesn't know how to do those things  and doesn't know how to do something that goes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid  mind. Mind your manners  Mind your adults  Mind what you're saying  This is the way children are raised properly. And I watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they're  much to the distress of my children  they are acting just like we did. You know  You imprint them. And that's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school. And I'm working at all the energy I have to sort of communicate this message that we need preschool  we need Head Start  we need prenatal care. The education process begins even before the child is born  and if you don't do that  you're going to have difficulty. And we are having difficulties in so many of our communities and so many of our schools where kids are coming to first grade and their eyes are blazing  they've got their little knapsack on and they're ready to go  and then they realize they're not like the other first graders who know books  have been read to  can do their alphabet. And by the third grade  the kids who didn't have that structure and minding in the beginning start to realize they're behind  and what do they do  They act it out. They act it out  and they're on their way to jail or they're on their way to being dropouts. It's predictable. If you're not at the right reading level at third grade  you are a candidate for jail at age     and we have the highest incarceration rate because we're not getting our kids the proper start in life. The last chapter in my book is called  The Gift of a Good Start.  The gift of a good start. Every child ought to have a good start in life. I was privileged to have that kind of good start. I was not a great student. I was a public school kid in New York City  and I didn't do well at all. I have my entire New York City Board of Education transcript from kindergarten through college. I wanted it when I was writing my first book. I wanted to see if my memory was correct  and  my God  it was.  Laughter  Straight C everywhere. And I finally bounced through high school  got into the City College of New York with a   .  average  which I shouldn't have been allowed in with  and then I started out in engineering  and that only lasted six months.  Laughter  And then I went into geology   rocks for jocks.  This is easy. And then I found ROTC. I found something that I did well and something that I loved doing  and I found a group of youngsters like me who felt the same way. And so my whole life then was dedicated to ROTC and the military. And I say to young kids everywhere  as you're growing up and as this structure is being developed inside of you  always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing  and when you find those two things together  man  you got it. That's what's going on. And that's what I found. Now the authorities at CCNY were getting tired of me being there. I'd been there four and a half going on five years  and my grades were not doing particularly well  and I was in occasional difficulties with the administration. And so they said   But he does so well in ROTC. Look  he gets straight A's in that but not in anything else.  And so they said   Look  let's take his ROTC grades and roll them into his overall GPA and see what happens.  And they did  and it brought me up to  . .  Laughter  Yep.  Laughter   Applause  They said   It's good enough for government work. Give him to the army. We'll never see him again. We'll never see him again.  So they shipped me off to the army  and lo and behold  many years later  I'm considered one of the greatest sons the City College of New York has ever had.  Laughter  So  I tell young people everywhere  it ain't where you start in life  it's what you do with life that determines where you end up in life  and you are blessed to be living in a country that  no matter where you start  you have opportunities so long as you believe in yourself  you believe in the society and the country  and you believe that you can self improve and educate yourself as you go along. And that's the key to success. But it begins with the gift of a good start. If we don't give that gift to each and every one of our kids  if we don't invest at the earliest age  we're going to be running into difficulties. It's why we have a dropout rate of roughly    percent overall and almost    percent of our minority population living in low income areas  because they're not getting the gift of a good start. My gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family  a good family  but having a family that said to me   Now listen  we came to this country in banana boats in      and     . We worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day. We're not doing it so that you can stick something up your nose or get in trouble. And don't even think about dropping out.  If I had ever gone home and told those immigrant people that   You know  I'm tired of school and I'm dropping out   they'd said   We're dropping you out. We'll get another kid.  They had expectations for all of the cousins and the extended family of immigrants that lived in the South Bronx  but they had more than just expectations for us. They stuck into our hearts like a dagger a sense of shame   Don't you shame this family.  Sometimes I would get in trouble  and my parents were coming home  and I was in my room waiting for what's going to happen  and I would sit there saying to myself   Okay  look  take the belt and hit me  but  God  don't give me that 'shame the family' bit again.  It devastated me when my mother did that to me. And I also had this extended network. Children need a network. Children need to be part of a tribe  a family  a community. In my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings. I don't know how many of you are New Yorkers  but there were these tenement buildings  and these women were always hanging out one of the windows  leaning on a pillow. They never left.  Laughter  I  so help me God  I grew up walking those streets  and they were always there. They never went to the bathroom. They never cooked.  Laughter  They never did anything. But what they did was keep us in play. They kept us in play. And they didn't care whether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general  and they never expected any generals in the family  as long as you got an education and then you got a job.  Don't give us any of that self actualization stuff. You get a job and get out of the house. We don't have time to waste for that. And then you can support us. That's the role of you guys.  And so  it's so essential that we kind of put this culture back into our families  all families. And it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people  and I'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren  it's not enough. You've got to reach out and back and find kids like Mr. Cruz who can make it if you give them the structure  if you reach back and help  if you mentor  if you invest in boys and girls clubs  if you work with your school system  make sure it's the best school system  and not just your kid's school  but the school uptown in Harlem  not just downtown Montessori on the West Side. All of us have to have a commitment to do that. And we're not just investing in the kids. We're investing in our future. We're going to be a minority majority country in one more generation. Those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority. And we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority. We have to make sure they're ready to be the leaders of this great country of ours  a country that is like no other  a country that amazes me every single day  a country that's fractious. We're always arguing with each other. That's how the system's supposed to work. It's a country of such contrasts  but it's a nation of nations. We touch every nation. Every nation touches us. We are a nation of immigrants. That's why we need sound immigration policy. It's ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy to welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation  or we can send back home with an education to help their people rise up out of poverty. One of the great stories I love to tell is about my love of going to my hometown of New York and walking up Park Avenue on a beautiful day and admiring everything and seeing all the people go by from all over the world. But what I always have to do is stop at one of the corners and get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler. Gotta have a dirty water dog.  Laughter  And no matter where I am or what I'm doing  I've got to do that. I even did it when I was Secretary of State. I'd come out of my suite at the Waldorf Astoria    Laughter    be walking up the street  and I would hit around   th Street looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler. In those days  I had five bodyguards around me and three New York City police cars would roll alongside to make sure nobody whacked me while I was going up Park Avenue.  Laughter  And I would order the hot dog from the guy  and he'd start to fix it  and then he'd look around at the bodyguards and the police cars     I've got a green card  I've got a green card    Laughter   It's okay  it's okay.  But now I'm alone. I'm alone. I've got no bodyguards  I've got no police cars. I've got nothing. But I gotta have my hot dog. I did it just last week. It was on a Tuesday evening down by Columbus Circle. And the scene repeats itself so often. I'll go up and ask for my hot dog  and the guy will fix it  and as he's finishing  he'll say   I know you. I see you on television. You're  well  you're General Powell.   Yes  yes.  Oh ...   I hand him the money.  No  General. You can't pay me. I've been paid. America has paid me. I never forget where I came from. But now I'm an American. Sir  thank you.  I accept the generosity  continue up the street  and it washes over me  my God  it's the same country that greeted my parents this way    years ago. So we are still that magnificent country  but we are fueled by young people coming up from every land in the world  and it is our obligation as contributing citizens to this wonderful country of ours to make sure that no child gets left behind. Thank you very much. So I want to talk to you about two things tonight. Number one  Teaching surgery and doing surgery is really hard. And second  that language is one of the most profound things that separate us all over the world. And in my little corner of the world  these two things are actually related  and I want to tell you how tonight. Now  nobody wants an operation. Who here has had surgery  Did you want it  Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation. Nobody wants an operation. In particular  nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions that cause a lot of pain  that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school  that leave a big scar. But if you have to have an operation  what you really want is a minimally invasive operation. That's what I want to talk to you about tonight    how doing and teaching this type of surgery led us on a search for a better universal translator. Now  this type of surgery is hard  and it starts by putting people to sleep  putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen  blowing them up like a balloon  sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen    it's dangerous stuff    and taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen. So let's see what it looks like. So this is gallbladder surgery. We perform a million of these a year in the United States alone. This is the real thing. There's no blood. And you can see how focused the surgeons are  how much concentration it takes. You can see it in their faces. It's hard to teach  and it's not all that easy to learn. We do about five million of these in the United States and maybe    million of these worldwide. All right  you've all heard the term   He's a born surgeon.  Let me tell you  surgeons are not born. Surgeons are not made either. There are no little tanks where we're making surgeons. Surgeons are trained one step at a time. It starts with a foundation  basic skills. We build on that and we take people  hopefully  to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant. Then we teach them to be a surgeon in training. And when they do all of that for about five years  they get the coveted board certification. If you need surgery  you want to be operated on by a board certified surgeon. You get your board certificate  and you can go out into practice. And eventually  if you're lucky  you achieve mastery. Now that foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery society in the United States  SAGES  started in the late     s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to go on and do procedures. Now the science behind this is so potent that it became required by the American Board of Surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified. It's not a lecture  it's not a course  it's all of that plus a high stakes assessment. It's hard. Now just this past year  one of our partners  the American College of Surgeons  teamed up with us to make an announcement that all surgeons should be FLS  Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery  certified before they do minimally invasive surgery. And are we talking about just people here in the U.S. and Canada  No  we just said all surgeons. So to lift this education and training worldwide is a very large task  something I'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world. SAGES does surgery all over the world  teaching and educating surgeons. So we have a problem  and one of the problems is distance. We can't travel everywhere. We need to make the world a smaller place. And I think that we can develop some tools to do so. And one of the tools I like personally is using video. So I was inspired by a friend. This is Allan Okrainec from Toronto. And he proved that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video conferencing. So here's Allan teaching an English speaking surgeon in Africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery. Very inspiring. But for this examination  which is really hard  we have a problem. Even people who say they speak English  only    percent pass. Because for them it's not a surgery test  it's an English test. Let me bring it to you locally. I work at the Cambridge Hospital. It's the primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility. We have more than     translators covering    languages  and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital. It's a big labor intensive effort. If you think about the worldwide burden of trying to talk to your patients    not just teaching surgeons  just trying to talk to your patients    there aren't enough translators in the world. We need to employ technology to assist us in this quest. At our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors to people who just got here last week. And you have no idea how hard it is to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to. And there isn't always a translator available. So we need tools. We need a universal translator. One of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world. It's really about setting up a dialogue. We have a lot to learn. Here in the United States we spend more money per person for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world. Maybe we have something to learn as well. So I'm passionate about teaching these FLS skills all over the world. This past year I've been in Latin America  I've been in China  talking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery. And everywhere I go the barrier is   We want this  but we need it in our language.  So here's what we think we want to do  Imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously. I want to talk to the people in Asia  Latin America  Africa  Europe seamlessly  accurately and in a cost effective fashion using technology. And it has to be bi directional. They have to be able to teach us something as well. It's a big task. So we looked for a universal translator  I thought there would be one out there. Your webpage has translation  your cellphone has translation  but nothing that's good enough to teach surgery. Because we need a lexicon. What is a lexicon  A lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain. I need to have a health care lexicon. And in that I need a surgery lexicon. That's a tall order. We have to work at it. So let me show you what we're doing. This is research    can't buy it. We're working with the folks at IBM Research from the Accessibility Center to string together technologies to work towards the universal translator. It starts with a framework system where when the surgeon delivers the lecture using a framework of captioning technology  we then add another technology to do video conferencing. But we don't have the words yet  so we add a third technology. And now we've got the words  and we can apply the special sauce  the translation. We get the words up in a window and then apply the magic. We work with a fourth technology. And we currently have access to eleven language pairs. More to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place. And I'd like to show you our prototype of stringing all of these technologies that don't necessarily always talk to each other to become something useful. Narrator  Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery. Module five  manual skills practice. Students may display captions in their native language. Steven Schwaitzberg  If you're in Latin America  you click the  I want it in Spanish  button and out it comes in real time in Spanish. But if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time  by using technology in a constructive fashion  you could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian    on and on and on  simultaneously without the use of human translators. But that's the lectures. If you remember what I told you about FLS at the beginning  it's knowledge and skills. The difference in an operation between doing something successfully and not may be moving your hand this much. So we're going to take it one step further  we've brought my friend Allan back. Allan Okrainec  Today we're going to practice suturing. This is how you hold the needle. Grab the needle at the tip. It's important to be accurate. Aim for the black dots. Orient your loop this way. Now go ahead and cut. Very good Oscar. I'll see you next week. SS  So that's what we're working on in our quest for the universal translator. We want it to be bi directional. We have a need to learn as well as to teach. I can think of a million uses for a tool like this. As we think about intersecting technologies    everybody has a cell phone with a camera    we could use this everywhere  whether it be health care  patient care  engineering  law  conferencing  translating videos. This is a ubiquitous tool. In order to break down our barriers  we have to learn to talk to people  to demand that people work on translation. We need it for our everyday life  in order to make the world a smaller place. Thank you very much. I'm here today to talk about a disturbing question  which has an equally disturbing answer. My topic is the secrets of domestic violence  and the question I'm going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks  Why does she stay  Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her  I'm not a psychiatrist  a social worker or an expert in domestic violence. I'm just one woman with a story to tell. I was   . I had just graduated from Harvard College. I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine. I had my first apartment  my first little green American Express card  and I had a very big secret. My secret was that I had this gun loaded with hollow point bullets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my soulmate  many  many times. The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can even remember. I'm here to tell you the story of crazy love  a psychological trap disguised as love  one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year. It may even be your story. I don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor. I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College  an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School. I've spent most of my career working for Fortune     companies including Johnson   Johnson  Leo Burnett and The Washington Post. I've been married for almost    years to my second husband and we have three kids together. My dog is a black lab  and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan. So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone    all races  all religions  all income and education levels. It's everywhere. And my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women  that it's a women's issue. Not exactly. Over    percent of abusers are men  and domestic abuse happens only in intimate  interdependent  long term relationships  in other words  in families  the last place we would want or expect to find violence  which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing. I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who beats me  but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age. I was     and in the United States  women ages    to    are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages  and over     women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners  boyfriends  and husbands in the United States. I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence  its warning signs or its patterns. I met Conor on a cold  rainy January night. He sat next to me on the New York City subway  and he started chatting me up. He told me two things. One was that he  too  had just graduated from an Ivy League school  and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank. But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy. He had these big cheeks  these big apple cheeks and this wheat blond hair  and he seemed so sweet. One of the smartest things Conor did  from the very beginning  was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship. He did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me. We started dating  and he loved everything about me  that I was smart  that I'd gone to Harvard  that I was passionate about helping teenage girls  and my job. He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams. Conor believed in me  as a writer and a woman  in a way that no one else ever had. And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret  which was that  as a very young boy starting at age four  he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather  and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade  even though he was very smart  and he'd spent almost    years rebuilding his life. Which is why that Ivy League degree and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him. If you had told me that this smart  funny  sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup  how short my skirts were  where I lived  what jobs I took  who my friends were and where I spent Christmas  I would have laughed at you  because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning. I didn't know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim. I also didn't know that the second step is to isolate the victim. Now  Conor did not come home one day and announce   You know  hey  all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great  but I need to move into the next phase where I isolate you and I abuse you     Laughter     so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises.  Instead  Conor came home one Friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day  his dream job  and he said that he had quit his job because of me  because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore  and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive  dysfunctional family  and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side. Now  the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York  and my dream job  but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate  so I agreed  and I quit my job  and Conor and I left Manhattan together. I had no idea I was falling into crazy love  that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical  financial and psychological trap. The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts. And here's where those guns come in. As soon as we moved to New England    you know  that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe    he bought three guns. He kept one in the glove compartment of our car. He kept one under the pillows on our bed  and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times. And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy. He needed them to feel protected. But those guns were really a message for me  and even though he hadn't raised a hand to me  my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day. Conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding. It was   a.m. I still had on my nightgown. I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment  and I got frustrated  and Conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream  and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall. Five days later  the ten bruises on my neck had just faded  and I put on my mother's wedding dress  and I married him. Despite what had happened  I was sure we were going to live happily ever after  because I loved him  and he loved me so much. And he was very  very sorry. He had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me. It was an isolated incident  and he was never going to hurt me again. It happened twice more on the honeymoon. The first time  I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost  and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver's side window. And then a few days later  driving home from our honeymoon  he got frustrated by traffic  and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face. Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage. I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation. One in three American women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life  and the CDC reports that    million children are abused every year     million. So actually  I was in very good company. Back to my question  Why did I stay  The answer is easy. I didn't know he was abusing me. Even though he held those loaded guns to my head  pushed me down stairs  threatened to kill our dog  pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway  poured coffee grinds on my head as I dressed for a job interview  I never once thought of myself as a battered wife. Instead  I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man  and I was the only person on Earth who could help Conor face his demons. The other question everybody asks is  why doesn't she just leave  Why didn't I walk out  I could have left any time. To me  this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask  because we victims know something you usually don't  It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser. Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her. Over    percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship  after she's gotten out  because then the abuser has nothing left to lose. Other outcomes include long term stalking  even after the abuser remarries  denial of financial resources  and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children  who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother. And still we ask  why doesn't she just leave  I was able to leave  because of one final  sadistic beating that broke through my denial. I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him. So I broke the silence. I told everyone  the police  my neighbors  my friends and family  total strangers  and I'm here today because you all helped me. We tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines  self destructive women  damaged goods. The question   Why does she stay   is code for some people for   It's her fault for staying   as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us. But since publishing  Crazy Love   I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out  who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened  and who rebuilt lives    joyous  happy lives    as employees  wives and mothers  lives completely free of violence  like me. Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor. I remarried a kind and gentle man  and we have those three kids. I have that black lab  and I have that minivan. What I will never have again  ever  is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me. Right now  maybe you're thinking   Wow  this is fascinating   or   Wow  how stupid was she   but this whole time  I've actually been talking about you. I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are abusers themselves. Abuse could be affecting your daughter  your sister  your best friend right now. I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence. I'm still breaking the silence today. It's my way of helping other victims  and it's my final request of you. Talk about what you heard here. Abuse thrives only in silence. You have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it. We victims need everyone. We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence. Show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children  your coworkers  your friends and family. Recast survivors as wonderful  lovable people with full futures. Recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene  deescalate it  show victims a safe way out. Together we can make our beds  our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be. Thank you. This is about a hidden corner of the labor market. It's the world of people who need to work ultra flexibly  if they're to work at all. So think  for instance  of someone who has a recurring but unpredictable medical condition  or somebody who's caring for a dependent adult  or a parent with complex child care needs. Their availability for work can be such that it's   A few hours today. Maybe I can work tomorrow  but I don't know if and when yet.  And it's extraordinarily difficult for these people to find the work that they so often need very badly. Which is a tragedy because there are employers who can use pools of very flexible local people booked completely ad hoc around when that person wants to work. Imagine that you run a cafe. It's mid morning  the place is filling up. You're going to have a busy lunchtime rush. If you could get two extra workers for    minutes to start in an hour's time  you'd do it  but they'd have to be reliable  inducted in how your cafe works. They'd have to be available at very competitive rates. They'd have to be bookable in about the next minute. In reality  no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business  so you are going to muddle by  understaffed. And it's not just caterers  it's hoteliers  it's retailers  it's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses. There's all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people  possibly already once they've been inducted. At this level of the labor market  what you need is a marketplace for spare hours. They do exist. Here's how they work. So in this example  a distribution company has said  we've got a rush order that we've got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning. Show us everyone who's available. It's found    workers. Everybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow. They're all contactable in time for this booking. They've all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings. And this booking is within all the parameters for each individual. And they would all be legally compliant by doing this booking. Of course  they're all trained to work in warehouses. You can select as many of them as you want. They're from multiple agencies. It's calculated the charge rate for each person for this specific booking. And it's monitoring their reliability. The people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones. They're likely to be more expensive. In an alternative view of this pool of local  very flexible people  here's a market research company  and it's inducted maybe    local people in how to do street interviewing. And they've got a new campaign. They want to run it next week. And they're looking at how many of the people they've inducted are available each hour next week. And they'll then decide when to do their street interviews. But is there more that could be done for this corner of the labor market  Because right now there are so many people who need whatever economic opportunity they can get. Let's make it personal. Imagine that a young woman    base of the economic pyramid  very little prospect of getting a job    what economic activity could she theoretically engage in  Well  she might be willing to work odd hours in a call center  in a reception area  in a mail room. She may be interested in providing local services to her community  babysitting  local deliveries  pet care. She may have possessions that she would like to trade at times she doesn't need them. So she might have a sofa bed in her front room that she would like to let out. She might have a bike  a video games console she only uses occasionally. And you're probably thinking    because you're all very web aware    yes  and we're in the era of collaborative consumption  so she can go online and do all this. She can go to Airbnb to list her sofa bed  she can go to TaskRabbit.com and say   I want to do local deliveries   and so on. These are good sites  but I believe we can go a step further. And the key to that is a philosophy that we call modern markets for all. Markets have changed beyond recognition in the last    years  but only for organizations at the top of the economy. If you're a Wall Street trader  you now take it for granted that you sell your financial assets in a system of markets that identifies the most profitable opportunities for you in real time  executes on that in microseconds within the boundaries you've set. It analyzes supply and demand and pricing and tells you where your next wave of opportunities are coming from. It manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways. It's all extremely low overhead. What have we gained at the bottom of the economy in terms of markets in the last    years  Basically classified adverts with a search facility. So why do we have this disparity between these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy that are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource out of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading  and what the rest of us have  A modern market is more than a website  it's a web of interoperable marketplaces  back office mechanisms  regulatory regimes  settlement mechanisms  liquidity sources and so on. And when a Wall Street trader comes into work in the morning  she does not write a listing for every financial derivative she wants to sell today and then post that listing on multiple websites and wait for potential buyers to get in touch and start negotiating the terms on which she might trade. In the early days of this modern markets technology  the financial institutions worked out how they could leverage their buying power  their back office processes  their relationships  their networks to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity. They asked governments for supporting regulatory regimes  and in a lot of cases they got it. But throughout the economy  there are facilities that could likewise leverage a new generation of markets for the benefit of all of us. And those facilities    I'm talking about things like the mechanisms that prove our identity  the licensing authorities that know what each of us is allowed to do legally at any given time  the processes by which we resolve disputes through official channels. These mechanisms  these facilities are not in the gift of Craigslist or Gumtree or Yahoo  they're controlled by the state. And the policymakers who sit on top of them are  I suggest  simply not thinking about how those facilities could be used to underpin a whole new era of markets. Like everyone else  those policymakers are taking it for granted that modern markets are the preserve of organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves. Suppose we stopped taking that for granted. Suppose tomorrow morning the prime minister of Britain or the president of the U.S.  or the leader of any other developed nation  woke up and said   I'm never going to be able to create all the jobs I need in the current climate. I have got to focus on whatever economic opportunity I can get to my citizens. And for that they have to be able to access state of the art markets. How do I make that happen   And I think I can see a few eyes rolling. Politicians in a big  complex  sophisticated I.T. project  Oh  that's going to be a disaster waiting to happen. Not necessarily. There is a precedent for technology enabled service that has been initiated by politicians in multiple countries and has been hugely successful  national lotteries. Let's take Britain as an example. Our government didn't design the national lottery  it didn't fund the national lottery  it doesn't operate the national lottery. It simply passed the National Lottery Act and this is what followed. This act defines what a national lottery will look like. It specifies certain benefits that the state can uniquely bestow on the operators. And it puts some obligations on those operators. In terms of spreading gambling activity to the masses  this was an unqualified success. But let's suppose that our aim is to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid. Could we use the same model  I believe we could. So imagine that policymakers outlined a facility. Let's call it national e markets  NEMs for short. Think of it as a regulated public utility. So it's on a par with the water supply or the road network. And it's a series of markets for low level trade that can be fulfilled by a person or a small company. And government has certain benefits it can uniquely bestow on these markets. It's about public spending going through these markets to buy public services at the local level. It's about interfacing these markets direct into the highest official channels in the land. It's about enshrining government's role as a publicist for these markets. It's about deregulating some sectors so that local people can enter them. So  taxi journeys might be one example. And there are certain obligations that should go with those benefits to be placed on the operators  and the key one is  of course  that the operators pay for everything  including all the interfacing into the public sector. So imagine that the operators make their return by building a percentage markup into each transaction. Imagine that there's a concession period defined of maybe    years in which they can take all these benefits and run with them. And imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told  whoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transaction to fund the whole thing will get the deal. So government then exits the frame. This is now in the hands of the consortium. Either they are going to unlock an awful lot of economic opportunity and make a percentage on all of it or it's all going to crash and burn  which is tough on their shareholders. It doesn't bother the taxpayer necessarily. And there would be no constraints on alternative markets. So this would just be one more choice among millions of Internet forums. But it could be very different  because having access to those state backed facilities could incentivize this consortium to seriously invest in the service. Because they would have to get a lot of these small transactions going to start making their return. So we're talking about sectors like home hair care  the hire of toys  farm work  hire of clothes even  meals delivered to your door  services for tourists  home care. This would be a world of very small trades  but very well informed  because national e markets will deliver data. So this is a local person potentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market. And they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training if they wanted to go into that market. They'd have to do assessment interviews with local parents who wanted a pool of babysitters. Is it worth their while  Should they be looking at other sectors  Should they be moving to another part of the country where there's a shortage of babysitters  This kind of data can become routine. And this data can be used by investors. So if there's a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country and the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training  an investor can pay for it and the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individuals for maybe the next two years. This is a world of atomized capitalism. So it's small trades by small people  but it's very informed  safe  convenient  low overhead and immediate. Some rough research suggests this could unlock around     million pounds' worth a day of new economic activity in a country the size of the U.K. Does that sound improbable to you  That's what a lot of people said about turbo trading in financial exchanges    years ago. Do not underestimate the transformative power of truly modern markets. Thank you. It was a Saturday afternoon in May  and I suddenly realized that the next day was Mother's Day  and I hadn't gotten anything for my mom  so I started thinking about what should I get my mom for Mother's Day  I thought  why don't I make her an interactive Mother's Day card using the Scratch software that I'd been developing with my research group at the MIT Media Lab  We developed it so that people could easily create their own interactive stories and games and animations  and then share their creations with one another. So I thought  this would be an opportunity to use Scratch to make an interactive card for my mom. Before making my own Mother's Day card  I thought I would take a look at the Scratch website. So over the last several years  kids around the world ages   and up  have shared their projects  and I thought  I wonder if  of those three million projects  whether anyone else has thought to put up Mother's Day cards. So in the search box I typed in  Mother's Day   and I was surprised and delighted to see a list of dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards that showed up on the Scratch website  many of them just in the past    hours by procrastinators just like myself. So I started taking a look at them.  Music  I saw one of them that featured a kitten and her mom and wishing her mom a happy Mother's Day. And the creator very considerately offered a replay for her mom. Another one was an interactive project where  when you moved the mouse over the letters of  Happy Mom Day   it reveals a special happy Mother's Day slogan. about how she had Googled to find out when Mother's Day was happening. she delivered a special Mother's Day greeting of how much she loved her mom. So I really enjoyed looking at these projects and interacting with these projects. In fact  I liked it so much that  instead of making my own project  I sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects.  Laughter  And actually  she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would. She wrote back to me and she said   I'm so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make Mother's Day cards for their mothers.  So my mom was happy  and that made me happy  but actually I was even happier for another reason. I was happy because these kids were using Scratch just in the way that we had hoped that they would. As they created their interactive Mother's Day cards  you could see that they were really becoming fluent with new technologies. What do I mean by fluent  I mean that they were able to start expressing themselves and to start expressing their ideas. When you become fluent with language  it means you can write an entry in your journal or tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend. And it's similar with new technologies. By writing  be creating these interactive Mother's Day cards  these kids were showing that they were really fluent with new technologies. Now maybe you won't be so surprised by this  because a lot of times people feel that young people today can do all sorts of things with technology. I mean  all of us have heard young people referred to as  digital natives.  But actually I'm sort of skeptical about this term. I'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives. When you really look at it  how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies  You often see them in situations like this  or like this  and there's no doubt that young people are very comfortable and familiar browsing and chatting and texting and gaming. But that doesn't really make you fluent. So young people today have lots of experience and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies  but a lot less so of creating with new technologies and expressing themselves with new technologies. It's almost as if they can read but not write with new technologies. And I'm really interested in seeing  how can we help young people become fluent so they can write with new technologies  And that really means that they need to be able to write their own computer programs  or code. So  increasingly  people are starting to recognize the importance of learning to code. You know  in recent years  there have been hundreds of new organizations and websites that are helping young people learn to code. You look online  you'll see places like Codecademy and events like CoderDojo and sites like Girls Who Code  or Black Girls Code. It seems that everybody is getting into the act. You know  just at the beginning of this year  at the turn of the new year  New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg made a New Year's resolution that he was going to learn to code in     . A few months later  the country of Estonia decided that all of its first graders should learn to code. And that triggered a debate in the U.K. about whether all the children there should learn to code. Now  for some of you  when you hear about this  it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code. When many people think of coding  they think of it as something that only a very narrow sub community of people are going to be doing  and they think of coding looking like this. And in fact  if this is what coding is like  it will only be a narrow sub community of people with special mathematical skills and technological background that can code. But coding doesn't have to be like this. Let me show you about what it's like to code in Scratch. So in Scratch  to code  you just snap blocks together. In this case  you take a move block  snap it into a stack  and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors of the different characters in your game or your story  in this case controlling the big fish. After you've created your program  you can click on  share   and then share your project with other people  so that they can use the project and start working on the project as well. So  of course  making a fish game isn't the only thing you can do with Scratch. Of the millions of projects on the Scratch website  there's everything from animated stories to school science projects to anime soap operas to virtual construction kits to recreations of classic video games to political opinion polls to trigonometry tutorials to interactive artwork  and  yes  interactive Mother's Day cards. So I think there's so many different ways that people can express themselves using this  to be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world. And it doesn't just stay on the screen. You can also code to interact with the physical world around you. Here's an example from Hong Kong  where some kids made a game and then built their own physical interface device and had a light sensor  so the light sensor detects the hole in the board  so as they move the physical saw  the light sensor detects the hole and controls the virtual saw on the screen and saws down the tree. We're going to continue to look at new ways of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world and connecting to the world around us. This is an example from a new version of Scratch that we'll be releasing in the next few months  and we're looking again to be able to push you in new directions. Here's an example. It uses the webcam. And as I move my hand  I can pop the balloons or I can move the bug. So it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect  where you interact with gestures in the world. But instead of just playing someone else's game  you get to create the games  and if you see someone else's game  you can just say  see inside   and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it. So there's a new block that says how much video motion there is  and then  if there's so much video motion  it will then tell the balloon to pop. The same way that this uses the camera to get information into Scratch  you can also use the microphone. Here's an example of a project using the microphone. So I'm going to let all of you control this game using your voices. As kids are creating projects like this  they're learning to code  but even more importantly  they're coding to learn. Because as they learn to code  it enables them to learn many other things  opens up many new opportunities for learning. Again  it's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing. When you learn to read and write  it opens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things. When you learn to read  you can then read to learn. And it's the same thing with coding. If you learn to code  you can code to learn. Now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious. You learn more about how computers work. But that's just where it starts. When you learn to code  it opens up for you to learn many other things. Let me show you an example. Here's another project  and I saw this when I was visiting one of the computer clubhouses. These are after school learning centers that we helped start that help young people from low income communities learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies. And when I went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago  I saw a    year old boy who was using our Scratch software to create a game somewhat like this one  and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game  but also he wanted to do more. He wanted to keep score. So this was a game where the big fish eats the little fish  but he wanted to keep score  so that each time the big fish eats the little fish  the score would go up and it would keep track  and he didn't know how to do that. So I showed him. In Scratch  you can create something called a variable. I'll call it score. And that creates some new blocks for you  and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score  so each time I click on  change score   it increments the score. So I showed this to the clubhouse member    let's call him Victor    and Victor  when he saw that this block would let him increment the score  he knew exactly what to do. He took the block and he put it into the program exactly where the big fish eats the little fish. So then  each time the big fish eats the little fish  he will increment the score  and the score will go up by one. And it's in fact working. And he saw this  and he was so excited  he reached his hand out to me  and he said   Thank you  thank you  thank you.  And what went through my mind was  how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students for teaching them variables   Laughter  It doesn't happen in most classrooms  but that's because in most classrooms  when kids learn about variables  they don't know why they're learning it. It's nothing that  really  they can make use of. When you learn ideas like this in Scratch  you can learn it in a way that's really meaningful and motivating for you  that you can understand the reason for learning variables  and we see that kids learn it more deeply and learn it better. Victor had  I'm sure  been taught about variables in schools  but he really didn't    he wasn't paying attention. Now he had a reason for learning variables. So when you learn through coding  and coding to learn  you're learning it in a meaningful context  and that's the best way of learning things. So as kids like Victor are creating projects like this  they're learning important concepts like variables  but that's just the start. As Victor worked on this project and created the scripts  he was also learning about the process of design  how to start with the glimmer of an idea and turn it into a fully fledged  functioning project like you see here. So he was learning many different core principles of design  about how to experiment with new ideas  how to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts  how to collaborate with other people on your projects  about how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong  how to keep persistent and to persevere in the face of frustrations when things aren't working well. Now those are important skills that aren't just relevant for coding. They're relevant for all sorts of different activities. Now  who knows if Victor is going to grow up and become a programmer or a professional computer scientist  It's probably not so likely  but regardless of what he does  he'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned. Regardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager or a mechanic or a community organizer  that these ideas are useful for everybody. Again  it's useful to think about this analogy with language. When you become fluent with reading and writing  it's not something that you're doing just to become a professional writer. Very few people become professional writers. But it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write. Again  the same thing with coding. Most people won't grow up to become professional computer scientists or programmers  but those skills of thinking creatively  reasoning systematically  working collaboratively    skills you develop when you code in Scratch    are things that people can use no matter what they're doing in their work lives. And it's not just about your work life. Coding can also enable you to express your ideas and feelings in your personal life. Let me end with just one more example. So this is an example that came from after I had sent the Mother's Day cards to my mom  she decided that she wanted to learn Scratch. So she made this project for my birthday and sent me a happy birthday Scratch card. Now this project is not going to win any prizes for design  and you can rest assured that my    year old mom is not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist. But working on this project enabled her to make a connection to someone that she cares about and enabled her to keep on learning new things and continuing to practice her creativity and developing new ways of expressing herself. So as we take a look and we see that Michael Bloomberg is learning to code  all of the children of Estonia learn to code  even my mom has learned to code  don't you think it's about time that you might be thinking about learning to code  If you're interested in giving it a try  I'd encourage you to go to the Scratch website. It's scratch.mit.edu  and give a try at coding. Thanks very much.  Applause  Human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other    Is that person dangerous  Are they attractive  Are they a potential mate  Are they a potential networking opportunity  We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them. What's your name  Where are you from  How old are you  What do you do  Then we get more personal with it. Have you ever had any diseases  Have you ever been divorced  Does your breath smell bad while you're answering my interrogation right now  What are you into  Who are you into  What gender do you like to sleep with  I get it. We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves. We start forming cliques as soon as we're old enough to know what acceptance feels like. We bond together based on anything that we can    music preference  race  gender  the block that we grew up on. We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices. Sometimes  though  just the question  what do you do   can feel like somebody's opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it. Because the categories  I've found  are too limiting. The boxes are too narrow. And this can get really dangerous. So here's a disclaimer about me  though  before we get too deep into this. I grew up in a very sheltered environment. I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early     s  two blocks from the epicenter of punk music. I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously based upbringing. Where I come from  if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind  you were the weirdo. It was an unorthodox upbringing  but as a kid on the streets of New York  you learn how to trust your own instincts  you learn how to go with your own ideas. So when I was six  I decided that I wanted to be a boy. I went to school one day and the kids wouldn't let me play basketball with them. They said they wouldn't let girls play. So I went home  and I shaved my head  and I came back the next day and I said   I'm a boy.  I mean  who knows  right  When you're six  maybe you can do that. I didn't want anyone to know that I was a girl  and they didn't. I kept up the charade for eight years. So this is me when I was   . I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called  Julian Po.  I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him. See  I was also a child actor  which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity  because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy. In fact  no one in my life knew that I was a girl    not my teachers at school  not my friends  not the directors that I worked with. Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam's apple or grab my crotch to check what I was working with. When I would go to the bathroom  I would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like I was peeing standing up. At sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn't want to kiss me without outing myself. It's worth mentioning though that I didn't hate my body or my genitalia. I didn't feel like I was in the wrong body. I felt like I was performing this elaborate act. I wouldn't have qualified as transgender. If my family  though  had been the kind of people to believe in therapy  they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty. But in my particular case  I just woke up one day when I was     and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again. Puberty had hit  and I had no idea what being a girl meant  and I was ready to figure out who I actually was. When a kid behaves like I did  they don't exactly have to come out  right  No one is exactly shocked. But I wasn't asked to define myself by my parents. When I was     and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love  it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl. Three years later  when I fell in love with a man  neither of my parents batted an eyelash either. See  it's one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that I wasn't ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point. I was just allowed to be me  growing and changing in every moment. So four  almost five years ago  Proposition    the great marriage equality debate  was raising a lot of dust around this country. And at the time  getting married wasn't really something I spent a lot of time thinking about. But I was struck by the fact that America  a country with such a tarnished civil rights record  could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly. And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country  between places where people believed in it and places where people didn't. And then  that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me. If this was a war with two disparate sides  I  by default  fell on team gay  because I certainly wasn't     percent straight. At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl's clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy  over compensating  boy chasing girly girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was  a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person. I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls  much like myself  who fell kind of between the lines    girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear  girls who had boys' haircuts but wore girly nail polish  girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees  girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything. I loved these people  and I admired their freedom  but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television. And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority  and in my own home country  based on one facet of my character. I was legally and indisputably a second class citizen. I was not an activist. I wave no flags in my own life. But I was plagued by this question  How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character  How could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else  Were we even a group  What group  And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination  Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was  And then it occurred to me  perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do. It might give them pause. Obviously I couldn't get    million people to the same dinner party  so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice  without any lighting  or without any manipulation of any kind on my part. Because in a photograph you can examine a lion's whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off. For me  photography is not just about exposing film  it's about exposing the viewer to something new  a place they haven't gone before  but most importantly  to people that they might be afraid of. Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant  far off cultures they never knew existed through pictures. So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits  mugshots if you will. And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not     percent straight  which  if you don't know  is a limitless number of people. So this was a very large undertaking  and to do it we needed some help. So I ran out in the freezing cold  and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago. And I took those photographs  and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help. And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York. And then we made this. Video  I'm iO Tillett Wright  and I'm an artist born and raised in New York City. Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today. My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who's anything other than     percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way. My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face.  We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal.  It's written in the Declaration of Independence. We are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded. There is no equality in the United States.   What does equality mean to you      Marriage     Freedom     Civil rights     Treat every person as you'd treat yourself   It's when you don't have to think about it  simple as that. The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage. Today in    states  more than half of this country  you can legally be fired just for your sexuality.   Who is responsible for equality    I've heard hundreds of people give the same answer   We are all responsible for equality.  So far we've shot     faces in New York City. And we wouldn't have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign. I want to take the project across the country. I want to visit    American cities  and I want to shoot       or       people. This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation. I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being.   Self evident truths           faces across America   iO Tillett Wright  Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that. Almost        people watched that video  and then they started emailing us from all over the country  asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces. And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated. So I changed my immediate goal to        faces. That video was made in the spring of       and as of today I have traveled to almost    cities and photographed almost       people. I know that this is a talk  but I'd like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them. Because if a picture is worth a thousand words  then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary. So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small town Texas  we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on. Visibility really is key. Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy. Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family  you're far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it. Of course  in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight  but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian. Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths. But here's what I was starting to learn that was really interesting  Self Evident Truths doesn't erase the differences between us. In fact  on the contrary  it highlights them. It presents  not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings  but the complexities found within each individual person. It wasn't that we had too many boxes  it was that we had too few. At some point I realized that my mission to photograph  gays  was inherently flawed  because there were a million different shades of gay. Here I was trying to help  and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid    yet another box. At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to     percent gay. And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me. People didn't know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before. Can you quantify your openness  Once they got over the shock  though  by and large people opted for somewhere between    to    percent or the   to    percent marks. Of course  there were lots of people who opted for a     percent one or the other  but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced. I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as  Grey.  Let me be clear though    and this is very important    in no way am I saying that preference doesn't exist. And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative  because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice  I invite you to go out and try to be grey. I'll take your picture just for trying. What I am saying though is that human beings are not one dimensional. The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this  If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here  and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another  there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between. And the reality that this presents is a complicated one. Because  for example  if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior  where exactly do you draw the line  Is it over here  by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far  Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far  Where exactly does one become a second class citizen  Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is. After traveling so much and meeting so many people  let me tell you  there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race. Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs  and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle  just being other than straight doesn't necessarily mean that we have anything in common. So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming  as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms  bus shelters  billboards  Facebook pages  screen savers  perhaps in watching this procession of humanity  something interesting and useful will begin to happen. Hopefully these categories  these binaries  these over simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they'll begin to fall away. Because really  they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are. What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity. And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity. At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights. So is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing  the right to adopt children  the right to marriage  the freedom to shop here  live here  buy here  Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father  your neighbor  your cousin  your uncle  the president  your police woman or the fireman  It's too late. Because I already am all of those things. We already are all of those things  and we always have been. So please don't greet us as strangers  greet us as your fellow human beings  period. Thank you. Salaam alaikum. Welcome to Doha. I am in charge of making this country's food secure. That is my job for the next two years  to design an entire master plan  and then for the next    years to implement it    of course  with so many other people. But first  I need to talk to you about a story  which is my story  about the story of this country that you're all here in today. And of course  most of you have had three meals today  and probably will continue to have after this event. So going in  what was Qatar in the     s  We were about        people living here. There was no water. There was no energy  no oil  no cars  none of that. Most of the people who lived here either lived in coastal villages  fishing  or were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water. None of the glamour that you see today existed. No cities like you see today in Doha or Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Kuwait or Riyadh. It wasn't that they couldn't develop cities. Resources weren't there to develop them. And you can see that life expectancy was also short. Most people died around the age of   . So let's move to chapter two  the oil era.       that's when they discovered oil. But unfortunately  it wasn't really fully exploited commercially until after the Second World War. What did it do  It changed the face of this country  as you can see today and witness. It also made all those people who roamed around the desert    looking for water  looking for food  trying to take care of their livestock    urbanize. You might find this strange  but in my family we have different accents. My mother has an accent that is so different to my father  and we're all a population of about         people in the same country. There are about five or six accents in this country as I speak. Someone says   How so  How could this happen   Because we lived scattered. We couldn't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources. And when the resources came  be it oil  we started building these fancy technologies and bringing people together because we needed the concentration. People started to get to know each other. And we realized that there are some differences in accents. So that is the chapter two  the oil era. Let's look at today. This is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha. So what's the population today  It's  .  million people. That is in less than    years. The average growth of our economy is about    percent for the past five years. Lifespan has increased to   . Water consumption has increased to     liters. And this is amongst the highest worldwide. From having no water whatsoever to consuming water to the highest degree  higher than any other nation. I don't know if this was a reaction to lack of water. But what is interesting about the story that I've just said  The interesting part is that we continue to grow    percent every year for the past five years without water. Now that is historic. It's never happened before in history. Cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water. This is history being made in this region. Not only cities that we're building  but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists  doctors. Build a nice home  bring the architect  design my house. These people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn't. But of course  with the use of technology. So Brazil has       millimeters per year of precipitation of rain. Qatar has     and we have that growth rate. The question is how. How could we survive that  We have no water whatsoever. Simply because of this gigantic  mammoth machine called desalination. Energy is the key factor here. It changed everything. It is that thing that we pump out of the ground  we burn tons of  probably most of you used it coming to Doha. So that is our lake  if you can see it. That is our river. That is how you all happen to use and enjoy water. This is the best technology that this region could ever have  desalination. So what are the risks  Do you worry much  I would say  perhaps if you look at the global facts  you will realize  of course I have to worry. There is growing demand  growing population. We've turned seven billion only a few months ago. And so that number also demands food. And there's predictions that we'll be nine billion by     . So a country that has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders. There's also changing diets. By elevating to a higher socio economic level  they also change their diet. They start eating more meat and so on and so forth. On the other hand  there is declining yields because of climate change and because of other factors. And so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen. This is the situation in Qatar  for those who don't know. We only have two days of water reserve. We import    percent of our food  and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land. The limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions  etc.  etc. So we also face risks. These risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity. The question is  is there a solution  Is there a sustainable solution  Indeed there is. This slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents that we've been working on over the past two years. Let's start with the water. So we know very well    I showed you earlier    that we need this energy. So if we're going to need energy  what sort of energy  A depletable energy  Fossil fuel  Or should we use something else  Do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy  I guess most of you by now realize that we do      days of sun. And so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need. And we will probably put       megawatts of solar systems to produce  .  million cubic meters of water. And that is a lot of water. That water will go then to the farmers  and the farmers will be able to water their plants  and they will be able then to supply society with food. But in order to sustain the horizontal line    because these are the projects  these are the systems that we will deliver    we need to also develop the vertical line  system sustenance  high level education  research and development  industries  technologies  to produce these technologies for application  and finally markets. But what gels all of it  what enables it  is legislation  policies  regulations. Without it we can't do anything. So that's what we are planning to do. Within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan and taking it to implementation. Our objective is to be a millennium city  just like many millennium cities around  Istanbul  Rome  London  Paris  Damascus  Cairo. We are only    years old  but we want to live forever as a city  to live in peace. Thank you very much. I have never  ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exile   Son  resist Gaddafi. Fight him. But don't you ever turn into a Gaddafi like revolutionary.  Almost two years have passed since the Libyan Revolution broke out  inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions. I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya to call for a day of rage and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi. And there it was  a great revolution. Young Libyan women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime  raising slogans of freedom  dignity  social justice. They have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi. They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south. Eventually  after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost        dead  we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant. However  Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden  a legacy of tyranny  corruption and seeds of diversions. For four decades Gaddafi's tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society. Aware of the devastation and the challenges  I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society  calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation. Almost     organizations were established in Benghazi during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi    almost     in Tripoli. After a period of    years in exile  I went back to Libya  and with unique enthusiasm  I started organizing workshops on capacity building  on human development of leadership skills. With an amazing group of women  I co founded the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace  a movement of women  leaders  from different walks of life  to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace. I met a very difficult environment in the pre elections  an environment which was increasingly polarized  an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion. I led an initiative by the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law  a law that would give every citizen  no matter what your background  the right to vote and run  and most importantly to stipulate on political parties the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists  creating the zipper list. Eventually  our initiative was adopted and successful. Women won   .  percent of the National Congress in the first elections ever in    years. However  bit by bit  the euphoria of the elections  and of the revolution as a whole  was fading out    for every day we were waking up to the news of violence. One day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs. On another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate. On another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers. And every day  every day we wake up with the rule of the militias and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners and their disrespect of the rule of law. Our society  shaped by a revolutionary mindset  became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles    freedom  dignity  social justice    that we first held. Intolerance  exclusion and revenge became the icons of the  aftermath  of the revolution. I am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zipper list and the elections. I'm rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice  made the wrong decision. We did not prioritize right. For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya. Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation  No  it didn't. What is it  then  Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion  by both men and women  Maybe what was missing was not the women only  but the feminine values of compassion  mercy and inclusion. Our society needs national dialogue and consensus building more than it needed the elections  which only reinforced polarization and division. Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical  quantitative representation of the feminine. We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage. We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy. We need to develop a feminine discourse that not only honors but also implements mercy instead of revenge  collaboration instead of competition  inclusion instead of exclusion. These are the ideals that a war torn Libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace. For peace has an alchemy  and this alchemy is about the intertwining  the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives. That's the real zipper. And we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically. According to a Quranic verse  Salam     peace     is the word of the all merciful God  raheem.  In turn  the word  raheem   which is known in all Abrahamic traditions  has the same root in Arabic as the word  rahem     womb    symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female  from which all tribes  all peoples  have emanated from. And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo  which grows within it  the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence. Thus we are told that  My mercy encompasses all things.  Thus we are told that  My mercy takes precedence over my anger.  May we all be granted a grace of mercy. Thank you. Let me tell you a story. It's my first year as a new high school science teacher  and I'm so eager. I'm so excited  I'm pouring myself into my lesson plans. But I'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything. This happens one day  I'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology  viruses and how they attack. And so I'm so excited to discuss this with them  and I come in and I say   Can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool   There's silence. Finally  my favorite student  she looks me straight in the eye  and she says   The reading sucked.  And then she clarified. She said   You know what  I don't mean that it sucks. It means that I didn't understand a word of it. It's boring. Um  who cares  and it sucks.  These sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now  and I realize that all of my other students are in the same boat  that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook  but not one of them really understood the main ideas. Not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool  why it's so important. I'm totally clueless. I have no idea what to do next. So the only thing I can think of is say   Listen. Let me tell you a story. The main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses. These guys are blown up a couple million times. The real bacteria and viruses are so small we can't see them without a microscope  and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick. But what a lot of people don't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick.  Now  the story that I start telling my kids  it starts out like a horror story. Once upon a time there's this happy little bacterium. Don't get too attached to him. Maybe he's floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere  and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good. Maybe he ate something bad for lunch  and then things get really horrible  as his skin rips apart  and he sees a virus coming out from his insides. And then it gets horrible when he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides. If    Ouch is right     If you see this  and you're a bacterium  this is like your worst nightmare. But if you're a virus and you see this  you cross those little legs of yours and you think   We rock.  Because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium. Here's what had to happen. A virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its DNA into it. The next thing is  that virus DNA made stuff that chopped up the bacteria DNA. And now that we've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA  the virus DNA takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses. Because  you see  DNA is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make. So this is kind of like going into a car factory and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots. The workers still come the next day  they do their job  but they're following different instructions. So replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses    that is  until it's so filled with viruses that it bursts. But that's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria. Some are much more crafty. When a secret agent virus infects a bacterium  they do a little espionage. Here  this cloaked  secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell  but here's the kicker  It doesn't do anything harmful    not at first. Instead  it silently slips into the bacteria's own DNA  and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell  waiting for instructions. And what's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies  the babies also have the virus DNA in them. So now we have a whole extended bacteria family  filled with virus sleeper cells. They're just happily living together until a signal happens and    BAM     all of the DNA pops out. It takes control of these cells  turns them into virus making factories  and they all burst  a huge  extended bacteria family  all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts  the viruses taking over the bacterium. So now you understand how viruses can attack cells. There are two ways  On the left is what we call the lytic way  where the viruses go right in and take over the cells. On the  right  is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses. So this stuff is not that hard  right  And now all of you understand it. But if you've graduated from high school  I can almost guarantee you've seen this information before. But I bet it was presented in a way that it didn't exactly stick in your mind. So when my students were first learning this  why did they hate it so much  Well  there were a couple of reasons. First of all  I can guarantee you that their textbooks didn't have secret agent viruses  and they didn't have horror stories. You know  in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness. It kills me. I'm not kidding. I used to work for an educational publisher  and as a writer  I was always told never to use stories or fun  engaging language  because then my work might not be viewed as  serious  and  scientific.  Right  I mean  because God forbid somebody have fun when they're learning science. So we have this field of science that's all about slime  and color changes. Check this out. And then we have  of course  as any good scientist has to have  explosions  But if a textbook seems too much fun  it's somehow unscientific. Now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible. If we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier  we could start by saying something like   These viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their DNA into a bacterium.  The way this showed up in the textbook  it looked like this   Bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium.  That's great  perfect for    year olds. But here's the thing. There are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there's no way that we could ever give that to students  because it contains some language that isn't completely accurate. For example  I told you that viruses have DNA. Well  a very tiny fraction of them don't. They have something called RNA instead. So a professional science writer would circle that and say   That has to go. We have to change it to something much more technical.  And after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation  they'd find fault with almost every word I've used  and they'd have to change anything that wasn't serious enough  and they'd have to change everything that wasn't     percent perfect. Then it would be accurate  but it would be completely impossible to understand. This is horrifying. You know  I keep talking about this idea of telling a story  and it's like science communication has taken on this idea of what I call the tyranny of precision  where you can't just tell a story. It's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know  who gives us all the details nobody cares about  where you're like   Oh  I met my friend for lunch the other day  and she was wearing these ugly jeans. I mean  they weren't really jeans  they were more kind of  like  leggings  but  like  I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings  like  but I think     and you're just like   Oh my God. What is the point   Or even worse  science education is becoming like that guy who always says   Actually.  Right  You want to be like   Oh  dude  we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive a hundred miles in total darkness.  And that guy's like   Actually  it was   .  miles.  And you're like   Actually  shut up  I'm just trying to tell a story.  Because good storytelling is all about emotional connection. We have to convince our audience that what we're talking about matters. But just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across. I'm reminded of what the architect Mies van der Rohe said  and I paraphrase  when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth. I think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education. Now  finally  I am often so disappointed when people think that I'm advocating a dumbing down of science. That's not true at all. I'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT  and I absolutely understand the importance of detailed  specific scientific communication between experts  but not when we're trying to teach    year olds. If a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA  that's not going to ruin their chances of success in science. But if a young learner can't understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this  that will ruin their chances of success. This needs to stop  and I wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems  and I beg them  I beseech them to just stop it. But I think that's unlikely. So we are so lucky that we have resources like the Internet  where we can circumvent these institutions from the bottom up. There's a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple  understandable ways. I dream of a Wikipedia like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand. And I myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that I put on YouTube. I explain chemical equilibrium using analogies to awkward middle school dances  and I talk about fuel cells with stories about boys and girls at a summer camp. The feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled and it's often written in LOLcats  but nonetheless it's so appreciative  so thankful that I know this is the right way we should be communicating science. There's still so much work left to be done  though  and if you're involved with science in any way I urge you to join me. Pick up a camera  start to write a blog  whatever  but leave out the seriousness  leave out the jargon. Make me laugh. Make me care. Leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point. How should you start  Why don't you say   Listen  let me tell you a story   Thank you. So  I'm an artist. I live in New York  and I've been working in advertising for    ever since I left school  so about seven  eight years now  and it was draining. I worked a lot of late nights. I worked a lot of weekends  and I found myself never having time for all the projects that I wanted to work on on my own. And one day I was at work and I saw a talk by Stefan Sagmeister on TED  and it was called  The power of time off   and he spoke about how every seven years  he takes a year off from work so he could do his own creative projects  and I was instantly inspired  and I just said   I have to do that. I have to take a year off. I need to take time to travel and spend time with my family and start my own creative ideas.  So the first of those projects ended up being something I called  One Second Every Day.  Basically I'm recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life  chronologically compiling these one second tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video until  you know  I can't record them anymore. The purpose of this project is  one  I hate not remembering things that I've done in the past. There's all these things that I've done with my life that I have no recollection of unless someone brings it up  and sometimes I think   Oh yeah  that's something that I did.  And something that I realized early on in the project was that if I wasn't doing anything interesting  I would probably forget to record the video. So the day    the first time that I forgot  it really hurt me  because it's something that I really wanted to    from the moment that I turned     I wanted to keep this project going until forever  and having missed that one second  I realized  it just kind of created this thing in my head where I never forgot ever again. So if I live to see    years of age  I'm going to have a five hour video that encapsulates    years of my life. When I turn     I'll have a one hour video that includes just my   s. This has really invigorated me day to day  when I wake up  to try and do something interesting with my day. Now  one of the things that I have issues with is that  as the days and weeks and months go by  time just seems to start blurring and blending into each other and  you know  I hated that  and visualization is the way to trigger memory. You know  this project for me is a way for me to bridge that gap and remember everything that I've done. Even just this one second allows me to remember everything else I did that one day. It's difficult  sometimes  to pick that one second. On a good day  I'll have maybe three or four seconds that I really want to choose  but I'll just have to narrow it down to one  but even narrowing it down to that one allows me to remember the other three anyway. It's also kind of a protest  a personal protest  against the culture we have now where people just are at concerts with their cell phones out recording the whole concert  and they're disturbing you. They're not even enjoying the show. They're watching the concert through their cell phone. I hate that. I admittedly used to be that guy a little bit  back in the day  and I've decided that the best way for me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my life and not be that person  is to just record that one second that will allow me to trigger that memory of   Yeah  that concert was amazing. I really loved that concert.  And it just takes a quick  quick second. I was on a three month road trip this summer. It was something that I've been dreaming about doing my whole life  just driving around the U.S. and Canada and just figuring out where to go the next day  and it was kind of outstanding. I actually ran out  I spent too much money on my road trip for the savings that I had to take my year off  so I had to  I went to Seattle and I spent some time with friends working on a really neat project. One of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family  and this really tragic thing happened where my sister in law  her intestine suddenly strangled one day  and we took her to the emergency room  and she was  she was in really bad shape. We almost lost her a couple of times  and I was there with my brother every day. It helped me realize something else during this project  is that recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult. It's not    we tend to take our cameras out when we're doing awesome things. Or we're   Oh  yeah  this party  let me take a picture.  But we rarely do that when we're having a bad day  and something horrible is happening. And I found that it's actually been very  very important to record even just that one second of a really bad moment. It really helps you appreciate the good times. It's not always a good day  so when you have a bad one  I think it's important to remember it  just as much as it is important to remember the  good  days. Now one of the things that I do is I don't use any filters  I don't use anything to    I try to capture the moment as much as possible as the way that I saw it with my own eyes. I started a rule of first person perspective. Early on  I think I had a couple of videos where you would see me in it  but I realized that wasn't the way to go. The way to really remember what I saw was to record it as I actually saw it. Now a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are  wouldn't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this  I turned    last week  which is there. I think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this. I think everyone would have a different interpretation of it. I think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day. Personally  I'm tired of forgetting  and this is a really easy thing to do. I mean  we all have HD capable cameras in our pockets right now    most people in this room  I bet    and it's something that's    I never want to forget another day that I've ever lived  and this is my way of doing that  and it'd be really interesting also to see  if you could just type in on a website   June            and you would just see a stream of people's lives on that particular day from all over the world. And I don't know  I think this project has a lot of possibilities  and I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day  so you can never forget that that day  you lived. Thank you. Organic chemists make molecules  very complicated molecules  by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules and reverse engineering. And as a chemist  one of the things I wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is  could we make a really cool universal chemistry set  In essence  could we  app  chemistry  Now what would this mean  and how would we do it  Well to start to do this  we took a  D printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware. And so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time  we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry. Now what could this mean  Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine  so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill  if you have this embedded in your device at the same time  and you do the chemistry  you may be able to make drugs in a new way. So how are we doing this in the lab  Well it requires software  it requires hardware and it requires chemical inks. And so the really cool bit is  the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer  and you download the blueprint  the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it in the device. And so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software. So what could this mean  Well  ultimately  it could mean that you could print your own medicine. And this is what we're doing in the lab at the moment. But to take baby steps to get there  first of all we want to look at drug design and production  or drug discovery and manufacturing. Because if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it  we could deploy it anywhere. You don't need to go to the chemist anymore. We can print drugs at point of need. We can download new diagnostics. Say a new super bug has emerged. You put it in your search engine  and you create the drug to treat the threat. So this allows you on the fly molecular assembly. But perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells  with your genes and your environment  and you print your own personal medicine. And if that doesn't seem fanciful enough  where do you think we're going to go  Well  you're going to have your own personal matter fabricator. Beam me up  Scotty. In my previous life  I was an artist. I still paint. I love art. I love the joy that color can give to our lives and to our communities  and I try to bring something of the artist in me in my politics  and I see part of my job today  the reason for being here  not just to campaign for my party  but for politics  and the role it can play for the better in our lives. For    years  I was mayor of Tirana  our capital. We faced many challenges. Art was part of the answer  and my name  in the very beginning  was linked with two things  demolition of illegal constructions in order to get public space back  and use of colors in order to revive the hope that had been lost in my city. But this use of colors was not just an artistic act. Rather  it was a form of political action in a context when the city budget I had available after being elected amounted to zero comma something. When we painted the first building  by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray of a facade  something unimaginable happened. There was a traffic jam and a crowd of people gathered as if it were the location of some spectacular accident  or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star. The French E.U. official in charge of the funding rushed to block the painting. He screeched that he would block the financing.  But why   I asked him.  Because the colors you have ordered do not meet European standards   he replied.  Well   I told him   the surroundings do not meet European standards  even though this is not what we want  but we will choose the colors ourselves  because this is exactly what we want. And if you do not let us continue with our work  I will hold a press conference here  right now  right in this road  and we will tell people that you look to me just like the censors of the socialist realism era.  Then he was kind of troubled  and asked me for a compromise. But I told him no  I'm sorry  compromise in colors is gray  and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime. So it's time for change. The rehabilitation of public spaces revived the feeling of belonging to a city that people lost. The pride of people about their own place of living  and there were feelings that had been buried deep for years under the fury of the illegal  barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space. And when colors came out everywhere  a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people. Big noise raised up   What is this  What is happening  What are colors doing to us   And we made a poll  the most fascinating poll I've seen in my life. We asked people   Do you want this action  and to have buildings painted like that   And then the second question was   Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue   To the first question     percent of people said yes  we like it. Thirty seven said no  we don't like it. But to the second question  half of them that didn't like it  they wanted it to continue.  Laughter  So we noticed change. People started to drop less litter in the streets  for example  started to pay taxes  started to feel something they had forgotten  and beauty was acting as a guardsman where municipal police  or the state itself  were missing. One day I remember walking along a street that had just been colored  and where we were in the process of planting trees  when I saw a shopkeeper and his wife putting a glass facade to their shop. They had thrown the old shutter in the garbage collection place.  Why did you throw away the shutters   I asked him.  Well  because the street is safer now   they answered.  Safer  Why  They have posted more policemen here    Come on  man  What policemen  You can see it for yourself. There are colors  streetlights  new pavement with no potholes  trees. So it's beautiful  it's safe.  And indeed  it was beauty that was giving people this feeling of being protected. And this was not a misplaced feeling. Crime did fall. The freedom that was won in      brought about a state of anarchy in the city  while the barbarism of the '  s brought about a loss of hope for the city. The paint on the walls did not feed children  nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant  but it gave hope and light  and helped to make people see there could be a different way of doing things  a different spirit  a different feel to our lives  and that if we brought the same energy and hope to our politics  we could build a better life for each other and for our country. We removed         tons of concrete only from the riverbanks. We demolished more than       illegal buildings all over the city  up to eight stories high  the tallest of them. We planted        trees and bushes in the streets. We established a green tax  and then everybody accepted it and all businessmen paid it regularly. By means of open competitions  we managed to recruit in our administration many young people  and we thus managed to build a de politicized public institution where men and women were equally represented. International organizations have invested a lot in Albania during these    years  not all of it well spent. When I told the World Bank directors that I wanted them to finance a project to build a model reception hall for citizens precisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption  they did not understand me. But people were waiting in long queues under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks. They were paying in order to skip the queue  the long queue. The reply to their requests was met by a voice coming from this dark hole  and  on the other hand  a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents while searching through old documents for the bribe. We could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks  every week  but we could not change this corrupt practice.  I'm convinced   I told a German official with the World Bank   that it would be impossible for them to be bribed if they worked in Germany  in a German administration  just as I am convinced that if you put German officials from the German administration in those holes  they would be bribed just the same.  It's not about genes. It's not about some being with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience. It's about system  it's about organization. It's also about environment and respect. We removed the kiosks. We built the bright new reception hall that made people  Tirana citizens  think they had traveled abroad when they entered to make their requests. We created an online system of control and so speeded up all the processes. We put the citizen first  and not the clerks. The corruption in the state administration of countries like Albania    it's not up to me to say also like Greece    can be fought only by modernization. Reinventing the government by reinventing politics itself is the answer  and not reinventing people based on a ready made formula that the developed world often tries in vain to impose to people like us. Things have come to this point because politicians in general  but especially in our countries  let's face it  think people are stupid. They take it for granted that  come what may  people have to follow them  while politics  more and more  fails to offer answers for their public concerns or the exigencies of the common people. Politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians  while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation. Seen from those stairs  all politicians today seem the same  and politics has come to resemble a sport that inspires more aggressiveness and pessimism than social cohesion and the desire for civic protaganism. Barack Obama won    Applause    because he mobilized people as never before through the use of social networks. He did not know each and every one of them  but with an admirable ingenuity  he managed to transform them into activists by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands the arguments and the instruments that each would need to campaign in his name by making his own campaign. I tweet. I love it. I love it because it lets me get the message out  but it also lets people get their messages to me. This is politics  not from top down  but from the bottom up  and sideways  and allowing everybody's voice to be heard is exactly what we need. Politics is not just about leaders. It's not just about politicians and laws. It is about how people think  how they view the world around them  how they use their time and their energy. When people say all politicians are the same  ask yourself if Obama was the same as Bush  if Fran ois Hollande is the same as Sarkozy. They are not. They are human beings with different views and different visions for the world. When people say nothing can change  just stop and think what the world was like                 years ago. Our world is defined by the pace of change. We can all change the world. I gave you a very small example of how one thing  the use of color  can make change happen. I want to make more change as Prime Minister of my country  but every single one of you can make change happen if you want to. President Roosevelt  he said   Believe you can  and you are halfway there.  Efharisto and kalinihta. When I was     I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house. My father was listening to BBC News on his small  gray radio. There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then  because the news mostly depressed him.  The Taliban are gone   my father shouted. I didn't know what it meant  but I could see that my father was very  very happy.  You can go to a real school now   he said. A morning that I will never forget. A real school. You see  I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school. So for the next five years  I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister  who was no longer allowed to be outside alone  to a secret school. It was the only way we both could be educated. Each day  we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going. We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping. The school was in a house  more than     of us packed in one small living room. It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer. We all knew we were risking our lives    the teacher  the students and our parents. From time to time  the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious. We always wondered what they knew about us. Were we being followed  Do they know where we live  We were scared  but still  school was where we wanted to be. I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured. My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time. A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan  he insisted that his daughter  my mom  go to school  and for that he was disowned by his father. But my educated mother became a teacher. There she is. She retired two years ago  only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood. And my father    that's him    he was the first ever in his family to receive an education. There was no question that his children would receive an education  including his daughters  despite the Taliban  despite the risks. To him  there was greater risk in not educating his children. During Taliban years  I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future. I would want to quit  but my father  he would say   Listen  my daughter  you can lose everything you own in your life. Your money can be stolen. You can be forced to leave your home during a war. But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here  and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees  we will. So do you still not want to continue   Today I am   . I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war. Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school  and had my family not been so committed to my education  I would be one of them. Instead  I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College. When I returned to Afghanistan  my grandfather  the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters  was among the first to congratulate me. He not only brags about my college degree  but also that I was the first woman  and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul. My family believes in me. I dream big  but my family dreams even bigger for me. That's why I am a global ambassador for   x    a global campaign to educate women. That's why I cofounded SOLA  the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan  a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school. The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity. And I see their parents and their fathers who  like my own  advocate for them  despite and even in the face of daunting opposition. Like Ahmed. That's not his real name  and I cannot show you his face  but Ahmed is the father of one of my students. Less than a month ago  he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village  and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes. As he arrived home  the phone rang  a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school  they would try again.  Kill me now  if you wish   he said   but I will not ruin my daughter's future because of your old and backward ideas.  What I've come to realize about Afghanistan  and this is something that is often dismissed in the West  that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success. It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success. In fact  they're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters  but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan  we must have the support of men. Under the Taliban  girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds    remember  it was illegal. But today  more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan. Afghanistan looks so different from here in America. I find that Americans see the fragility in changes. I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal. But when I am back in Afghanistan  when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them  who encourage them  I see a promising future and lasting change. To me  Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities  and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that. Like me  they are dreaming big. Thank you. You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road. It's made of asphalt  and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on  but not always  especially not on these days as today  when it's raining a lot. Then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt. And especially if you then ride with your bicycle  and pass these cars  then that's not very nice. Also  asphalt can create a lot of noise. It's a noisy material  and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands  very close to cities  then we would like a silent road. The solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt. Porous asphalt  a material that we use now in most of the highways in the Netherlands  it has pores and water can just rain through it  so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides  and you have a road that's easy to drive on  so no splash water anymore. Also the noise will disappear in these pores. Because it's very hollow  all the noise will disappear  so it's a very silent road. It also has disadvantages  of course  and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur. What is raveling  You see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off. First you get one stone  then several more  and more and more and more and more  and then they    well  I will not do that.  Laughter  But they can damage your windshield  so you're not happy with that. And finally  this raveling can also lead to more and more damage. Sometimes you can create potholes with that. Ha. He's ready. Potholes  of course  that can become a problem  but we have a solution. Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material. It's a porous asphalt  like I said  so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones. Due to weathering  due to U.V. light  due to oxidation  this binder  this bitumen  the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink  and if it shrinks  it gets micro cracks  and it delaminates from the aggregates. Then if you drive over the road  you take out the aggregates    what we just saw here. To solve this problem  we thought of self healing materials. If we can make this material self healing  then probably we have a solution. So what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans  and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces  and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen. So then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it. Then you need a machine  like you see here  that you can use for cooking    an induction machine. Induction can heat  especially steel  it's very good at that. Then what you do is you heat up the steel  you melt the bitumen  and the bitumen will flow into these micro cracks  and the stones are again fixed to the surface. Today I use a microwave because I cannot take the big induction machine here onstage. So a microwave is a similar system. So I put the specimen in  which I'm now going to take out to see what happened. So this is the specimen coming out now. So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens. We tested a lot of specimens there  and then the government  they actually saw our results  and they thought   Well  that's very interesting. We have to try that.  So they donated to us a piece of highway      meters of the A    where we had to make a test track to test this material. So that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test road  and then of course this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know from practice. So we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab. So we did aging on the samples  did a lot of loading on it  healed them with our induction machine  and healed them and tested them again. Several times we can repeat that. So actually  the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine    this is the big version we have made to go on the real road    if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road  which of course saves a lot of money. Well  to conclude  I can say that we made a material using steel fibers  the addition of steel fibers  using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road  double the surface life you can even do  so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks. And now you're of course curious if it also worked. So we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm. Actually  it still has to cool down first before I can show you that the healing works. But I will do a trial. Let's see. Yeah  it worked. Thank you.  When the crisis came  the serious limitations of existing economic and financial models immediately became apparent.   There is also a strong belief  which I share  that bad or oversimplistic and overconfident economics helped create the crisis.  Now  you've probably all heard of similar criticism coming from people who are skeptical of capitalism. But this is different. This is coming from the heart of finance. The first quote is from Jean Claude Trichet when he was governor of the European Central Bank. The second quote is from the head of the U.K. Financial Services Authority. Are these people implying that we don't understand the economic systems that drive our modern societies  It gets worse.  We spend billions of dollars trying to understand the origins of the universe while we still don't understand the conditions for a stable society  a functioning economy  or peace.  What's happening here  How can this be possible  Do we really understand more about the fabric of reality than we do about the fabric which emerges from our human interactions  Unfortunately  the answer is yes. But there's an intriguing solution which is coming from what is known as the science of complexity. To explain what this means and what this thing is  please let me quickly take a couple of steps back. I ended up in physics by accident. It was a random encounter when I was young  and since then  I've often wondered about the amazing success of physics in describing the reality we wake up in every day. In a nutshell  you can think of physics as follows. So you take a chunk of reality you want to understand and you translate it into mathematics. You encode it into equations. Then predictions can be made and tested. We're actually really lucky that this works  because no one really knows why the thoughts in our heads should actually relate to the fundamental workings of the universe. Despite the success  physics has its limits. As Dirk Helbing pointed out in the last quote  we don't really understand the complexity that relates to us  that surrounds us. This paradox is what got me interested in complex systems. So these are systems which are made up of many interconnected or interacting parts  swarms of birds or fish  ant colonies  ecosystems  brains  financial markets. These are just a few examples. Interestingly  complex systems are very hard to map into mathematical equations  so the usual physics approach doesn't really work here. So what do we know about complex systems  Well  it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction. This means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system by looking at the interactions  so you can actually forget about the equations and you just start to look at the interactions. And it gets even better  because most complex systems have this amazing property called emergence. So this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which cannot be understood or predicted by looking at the components of the system. So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts. And all of this also means that you can forget about the individual parts of the system  how complex they are. So if it's a cell or a termite or a bird  you just focus on the rules of interaction. As a result  networks are ideal representations of complex systems. The nodes in the network are the system's components and the links are given by the interactions. So what equations are for physics  complex networks are for the study of complex systems. This approach has been very successfully applied to many complex systems in physics  biology  computer science  the social sciences  but what about economics  Where are economic networks  This is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature. The study we published last year called  The Network of Global Corporate Control  was the first extensive analysis of economic networks. The study went viral on the Internet and it attracted a lot of attention from the international media. This is quite remarkable  because  again  why did no one look at this before  Similar data has been around for quite some time. What we looked at in detail was ownership networks. So here the nodes are companies  people  governments  foundations  etc. And the links represent the shareholding relations  so Shareholder A has x percent of the shares in Company B. And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue. So ownership networks reveal the patterns of shareholding relations. In this little example  you can see a few financial institutions with some of the many links highlighted. Now you may think that no one's looked at this before because ownership networks are really  really boring to study. Well  as ownership is related to control  as I shall explain later  looking at ownership networks actually can give you answers to questions like  who are the key players  How are they organized  Are they isolated  Are they interconnected  And what is the overall distribution of control  In other words  who controls the world  I think this is an interesting question. And it has implications for systemic risk. This is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall. A high degree of interconnectivity can be bad for stability  because then the stress can spread through the system like an epidemic. Scientists have sometimes criticized economists who believe ideas and concepts are more important than empirical data  because a foundational guideline in science is  Let the data speak. Okay. Let's do that. So we started with a database containing    million ownership relations from     . This is a lot of data  and because we wanted to find out who rules the world  we decided to focus on transnational corporations  or TNCs for short. These are companies that operate in more than one country  and we found       . In the next step  we built the network around these companies  so we took all the TNCs' shareholders  and the shareholders' shareholders  etc.  all the way upstream  and we did the same downstream  and ended up with a network containing         nodes and one million links. This is the TNC network which we analyzed. And it turns out to be structured as follows. So you have a periphery and a center which contains about    percent of all the players  and in the center there's this tiny but dominant core which is made up of highly interconnected companies. To give you a better picture  think about a metropolitan area. So you have the suburbs and the periphery  you have a center like a financial district  then the core will be something like the tallest high rise building in the center. And we already see signs of organization going on here. Thirty six percent of the TNCs are in the core only  but they make up    percent of the total operating revenue of all TNCs. Okay  so now we analyzed the structure  so how does this relate to the control  Well  ownership gives voting rights to shareholders. This is the normal notion of control. And there are different models which allow you to compute the control you get from ownership. If you have more than    percent of the shares in a company  you get control  but usually it depends on the relative distribution of shares. And the network really matters. About    years ago  Mr. Tronchetti Provera had ownership and control in a small company  which had ownership and control in a bigger company. You get the idea. This ended up giving him control in Telecom Italia with a leverage of   . So this means that  with each euro he invested  he was able to move    euros of market value through the chain of ownership relations. Now what we actually computed in our study was the control over the TNCs' value. This allowed us to assign a degree of influence to each shareholder. This is very much in the sense of Max Weber's idea of potential power  which is the probability of imposing one's own will despite the opposition of others. If you want to compute the flow in an ownership network  this is what you have to do. It's actually not that hard to understand. Let me explain by giving you this analogy. So think about water flowing in pipes where the pipes have different thickness. So similarly  the control is flowing in the ownership networks and is accumulating at the nodes. So what did we find after computing all this network control  Well  it turns out that the     top shareholders have the potential to collectively control    percent of the TNCs' value. Now remember  we started out with         nodes  so these     top players make up a bit more than  .  percent. They're mostly financial institutions in the U.S. and the U.K. And it gets even more extreme. There are     top players in the core  and they together have the potential to collectively control    percent of the TNCs' value. What should you take home from all of this  Well  the high degree of control you saw is very extreme by any standard. The high degree of interconnectivity of the top players in the core could pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy and we could easily reproduce the TNC network with a few simple rules. This means that its structure is probably the result of self organization. It's an emergent property which depends on the rules of interaction in the system  so it's probably not the result of a top down approach like a global conspiracy. Our study  is an impression of the moon's surface. It's not a street map.  So you should take the exact numbers in our study with a grain of salt  yet it  gave us a tantalizing glimpse of a brave new world of finance.  We hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction  so the remaining unknown terrain will be charted in the future. And this is slowly starting. We're seeing the emergence of long term and highly funded programs which aim at understanding our networked world from a complexity point of view. But this journey has only just begun  so we will have to wait before we see the first results. Now there is still a big problem  in my opinion. Ideas relating to finance  economics  politics  society  are very often tainted by people's personal ideologies. I really hope that this complexity perspective allows for some common ground to be found. It would be really great if it has the power to help end the gridlock created by conflicting ideas  which appears to be paralyzing our globalized world. Reality is so complex  we need to move away from dogma. But this is just my own personal ideology. Thank you. So  why does good sex so often fade  even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever  And why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex  contrary to popular belief  Or  the next question would be  can we want what we already have  That's the million dollar question  right  And why is the forbidden so erotic  What is it about transgression that makes desire so potent  And why does sex make babies  and babies spell erotic disaster in couples  It's kind of the fatal erotic blow  isn't it  And when you love  how does it feel  And when you desire  how is it different  These are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love. So I travel the globe  and what I'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered  there seems to be a crisis of desire. A crisis of desire  as in owning the wanting    desire as an expression of our individuality  of our free choice  of our preferences  of our identity    desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies. You know  this is the first time in the history of humankind where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term not because we want    children  for which we need to have even more because many of them won't make it  and not because it is exclusively a woman's marital duty. This is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire. So what sustains desire  and why is it so difficult  And at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship  I think  is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs. On the one hand  our need for security  for predictability  for safety  for dependability  for reliability  for permanence. All these anchoring  grounding experiences of our lives that we call home. But we also have an equally strong need    men and women    for adventure  for novelty  for mystery  for risk  for danger  for the unknown  for the unexpected  surprise    you get the gist. For journey  for travel. So reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship  or what we today like to call a passionate marriage  used to be a contradiction in terms. Marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship. But now we want our partner to still give us all these things  but in addition I want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot  and we live twice as long. So we come to one person  and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide. Give me belonging  give me identity  give me continuity  but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one. Give me comfort  give me edge. Give me novelty  give me familiarity. Give me predictability  give me surprise. And we think it's a given  and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that. So now we get to the existential reality of the story  right  Because I think  in some way    and I'll come back to that    but the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination. So why does good sex so often fade  What is the relationship between love and desire  How do they relate  and how do they conflict  Because therein lies the mystery of eroticism. So if there is a verb  for me  that comes with love  it's  to have.  And if there is a verb that comes with desire  it is  to want.  In love  we want to have  we want to know the beloved. We want to minimize the distance. We want to contract that gap. We want to neutralize the tensions. We want closeness. But in desire  we tend to not really want to go back to the places we've already gone. Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest. In desire  we want an Other  somebody on the other side that we can go visit  that we can go spend some time with  that we can go see what goes on in their red light district. You know  In desire  we want a bridge to cross. Or in other words  I sometimes say  fire needs air. Desire needs space. And when it's said like that  it's often quite abstract. But then I took a question with me. And I've gone to more than    countries in the last few years with  Mating in Captivity   and I asked people  when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner  Not attracted sexually  per Se  but most drawn. And across culture  across religion  and across gender    except for one    there are a few answers that just keep coming back. So the first group is  I am most drawn to my partner when she is away  when we are apart  when we reunite. Basically  when I get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner  when my imagination comes back in the picture  and when I can root it in absence and in longing  which is a major component of desire. But then the second group is even more interesting. I am most drawn to my partner when I see him in the studio  when she is onstage  when he is in his element  when she's doing something she's passionate about  when I see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him  when I see her hold court. Basically  when I look at my partner radiant and confident. Probably the biggest turn on across the board. Radiant  as in self sustaining. I look at this person    by the way  in desire people rarely talk about it  when we are blended into one  five centimeters from each other. I don't know in inches how much that is. But it's also not when the other person is that far apart that you no longer see them. It's when I'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance  where this person that is already so familiar  so known  is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious  somewhat elusive. And in this space between me and the other lies the erotic  lan  lies that movement toward the other. Because sometimes  as Proust says  mystery is not about traveling to new places  but it's about looking with new eyes. And so  when I see my partner on his own or her own  doing something in which they are enveloped  I look at this person and I momentarily get a shift in perception  and I stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me. And then  more importantly  in this description about the other or myself    it's the same    what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire. Nobody needs anybody. There is no caretaking in desire. Caretaking is mightily loving. It's a powerful anti aphrodisiac. I have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them. Wanting them is one thing. Needing them is a shot down and women have known that forever  because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge. For good reasons  right  And then the third group of answers usually would be  when I'm surprised  when we laugh together  as somebody said to me in the office today  when he's in his tux  so I said  you know  it's either the tux or the cowboy boots. But basically it's when there is novelty. But novelty isn't about new positions. It isn't a repertoire of techniques. Novelty is  what parts of you do you bring out  What parts of you are just being seen  Because in some way one could say sex isn't something you do  eh  Sex is a place you go. It's a space you enter inside yourself and with another  or others. So where do you go in sex  What parts of you do you connect to  What do you seek to express there  Is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union  Is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive  Is it a place where you can finally surrender and not have to take responsibility for everything  Is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes  What comes out there  It's a language. It isn't just a behavior. And it's the poetic of that language that I'm interested in  which is why I began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence. You know  animals have sex. It's the pivot  it's biology  it's the natural instinct. We are the only ones who have an erotic life  which means that it's sexuality transformed by the human imagination. We are the only ones who can make love for hours  have a blissful time  multiple orgasms  and touch nobody  just because we can imagine it. We can hint at it. We don't even have to do it. We can experience that powerful thing called anticipation  which is a mortar to desire. The ability to imagine it  as if it's happening  to experience it as if it's happening  while nothing is happening and everything is happening  at the same time. So when I began to think about eroticism  I began to think about the poetics of sex. And if I look at it as an intelligence  then it's something that you cultivate. What are the ingredients  Imagination  playfulness  novelty  curiosity  mystery. But the central agent is really that piece called the imagination. But more importantly  for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark  what sustains desire  I had to go back to the original definition of eroticism  the mystical definition  and I went through it through a bifurcation by looking  actually  at trauma  which is the other side. And I looked at it  looking at the community that I had grown up in  which was a community in Belgium  all Holocaust survivors  and in my community  there were two groups  those who didn't die  and those who came back to life. And those who didn't die lived often very tethered to the ground  could not experience pleasure  could not trust  because when you're vigilant  worried  anxious  and insecure  you can't lift your head to go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative. Those who came back to life were those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death. They knew how to keep themselves alive. And when I began to listen to the sexlessness of the couples that I work with  I sometimes would hear people say   I want more sex   but generally  people want better sex  and better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness  of vibrancy  of renewal  of vitality  of Eros  of energy that sex used to afford them  or that they've hoped it would afford them. And so I began to ask a different question.  I shut myself off when ...  began to be the question.  I turn off my desires when ...  Which is not the same question as   What turns me off is ...  and  You turn me off when ...  And people began to say   I turn myself off when I feel dead inside  when I don't like my body  when I feel old  when I haven't had time for myself  when I haven't had a chance to even check in with you  when I don't perform well at work  when I feel low self esteem  when I don't have a sense of self worth  when I don't feel like I have a right to want  to take  to receive pleasure.  And then I began to ask the reverse question.  I turn myself on when ...  Because most of the time  people like to ask the question   You turn me on  what turns me on   and I'm out of the question  you know  Now  if you are dead inside  the other person can do a lot of things for Valentine's. It won't make a dent. There is nobody at the reception desk. So I turn myself on when  I turn on my desires  I wake up when ... Now  in this paradox between love and desire  what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love    mutuality  reciprocity  protection  worry  responsibility for the other    are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire. Because desire comes with a host of feelings that are not always such favorites of love  jealousy  possessiveness  aggression  power  dominance  naughtiness  mischief. Basically most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things that we will demonstrate against during the day. You know  the erotic mind is not very politically correct. If everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses  we wouldn't be having such interesting talks about this. But no  in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don't always know how to bring to the person that we love  because we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word  the ability to stay connected to one's self in the presence of another. So I want to draw that little image for you  because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs  we are born with that. Our need for connection  our need for separateness  or our need for security and adventure  or our need for togetherness and for autonomy  and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable  and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore. That's the beginning of desire  that exploratory need  curiosity  discovery. And then at some point they turn around and they look at you. And if you tell them   Hey kiddo  the world's a great place. Go for it. There's so much fun out there   then they can turn away and they can experience connection and separateness at the same time. They can go off in their imagination  off in their body  off in their playfulness  all the while knowing that there's somebody when they come back. But if on this side there is somebody who says   I'm worried. I'm anxious. I'm depressed. My partner hasn't taken care of me in so long. What's so good out there  Don't we have everything you need together  you and I   then there are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize. Some of us will come back  came back a long time ago  and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgo a part of himself in order not to lose the other. I will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection. And I will learn to love in a certain way that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibility and extra protection  and I won't know how to leave you in order to go play  in order to go experience pleasure  in order to discover  to enter inside myself. Translate this into adult language. It starts very young. It continues into our sex lives up to the end. Child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time.  Are you going to be there  Are you going to curse me  scold me  Are you going to be angry with me   And they may be gone  but they're never really away. And those are often the people that will tell you   In the beginning  it was super hot.  Because in the beginning  the growing intimacy wasn't yet so strong that it actually led to the decrease of desire. The more connected I became  the more responsible I felt  the less I was able to let go in your presence. The third child doesn't really come back. So what happens  if you want to sustain desire  it's that real dialectic piece. On the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go. On the other hand if you can't go  you can't have pleasure  you can't culminate  you don't have an orgasm  you don't get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own. So in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs  there are a few things that I've come to understand erotic couples do. One  they have a lot of sexual privacy. They understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them. They also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing. Foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm. They also understand that an erotic space isn't about  you begin to stroke the other. It's about you create a space where you leave Management Inc.  maybe where you leave the Agile program    And you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things and being responsible. Responsibility and desire just butt heads. They don't really do well together. Erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes. It's pretty much like the moon. It has intermittent eclipses. But what they know is they know how to resurrect it. They know how to bring it back. And they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth  which is the myth of spontaneity  which is that it's just going to fall from heaven while you're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina  and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long term relationship  already has. Committed sex is premeditated sex. It's willful. It's intentional. It's focus and presence. Merry Valentine's. The theme of my talk today is   Be an artist  right now.  Most people  when this subject is brought up  get tense and resist it   Art doesn't feed me  and right now I'm busy. I have to go to school  get a job  send my kids to lessons ...   You think   I'm too busy. I don't have time for art.  There are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now. Don't they just pop into your head  There are so many reasons why we can't be  indeed  we're not sure why we should be. We don't know why we should be artists  but we have many reasons why we can't be. Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art  Perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted or for the thoroughly and professionally trained. And some of you may think you've strayed too far from art. Well you might have  but I don't think so. This is the theme of my talk today. We are all born artists. If you have kids  you know what I mean. Almost everything kids do is art. They draw with crayons on the wall. They dance to Son Dam Bi's dance on TV  but you can't even call it Son Dam Bi's dance    it becomes the kids' own dance. So they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone. Perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear  and because they practice such art all day long  people honestly get a little tired around kids. Kids will sometimes perform monodramas    playing house is indeed a monodrama or a play. And some kids  when they get a bit older  start to lie. Usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies. They're shocked.  Now you're showing your true colors   Mom says. She thinks   Why does he take after his dad   She questions him   What kind of a person are you going to be   But you shouldn't worry. The moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins. They are talking about things they didn't see. It's amazing. It's a wonderful moment. Parents should celebrate.  Hurray  My boy finally started to lie   All right  It calls for celebration. For example  a kid says   Mom  guess what  I met an alien on my way home.  Then a typical mom responds   Stop that nonsense.  Now  an ideal parent is someone who responds like this   Really  An alien  huh  What did it look like  Did it say anything  Where did you meet it    Um  in front of the supermarket.  When you have a conversation like this  the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started. Soon  a story develops. Of course this is an infantile story  but thinking up one sentence after the next is the same thing a professional writer like me does. In essence  they are not different. Roland Barthes once said of Flaubert's novels   Flaubert did not write a novel. He merely connected one sentence after another. The eros between sentences  that is the essence of Flaubert's novel.  That's right    a novel  basically  is writing one sentence  then  without violating the scope of the first one  writing the next sentence. And you continue to make connections. Take a look at this sentence   One morning  as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams  he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug.  Yes  it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's  The Metamorphosis.  Writing such an unjustifiable sentence and continuing in order to justify it  Kafka's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature. Kafka did not show his work to his father. He was not on good terms with his father. On his own  he wrote these sentences. Had he shown his father   My boy has finally lost it   he would've thought. And that's right. Art is about going a little nuts and justifying the next sentence  which is not much different from what a kid does. A kid who has just started to lie is taking the first step as a storyteller. Kids do art. They don't get tired and they have fun doing it. I was in Jeju Island a few days ago. When kids are on the beach  most of them love playing in the water. But some of them spend a lot of time in the sand  making mountains and seas    well  not seas  but different things    people and dogs  etc. But parents tell them   It will all be washed away by the waves.  In other words  it's useless. There's no need. But kids don't mind. They have fun in the moment and they keep playing in the sand. Kids don't do it because someone told them to. They aren't told by their boss or anyone  they just do it. When you were little  I bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art. When I ask my students to write about their happiest moment  many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid. Learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend  or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots    things like that. Or the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera. They talk about these kinds of experiences. You must have had such a moment. In that moment  art makes you happy because it's not work. Work doesn't make you happy  does it  Mostly it's tough. The French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying. It's a bit mischievous  actually.  Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired.  Right  Why would work tire us if it's in our nature  Playing doesn't tire us. We can play all night long. If we work overnight  we should be paid for overtime. Why  Because it's tiring and we feel fatigue. But kids  usually they do art for fun. It's playing. They don't draw to sell the work to a client or play the piano to earn money for the family. Of course  there were kids who had to. You know this gentleman  right  He had to tour around Europe to support his family    Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart    but that was centuries ago  so we can make him an exception. Unfortunately  at some point our art    such a joyful pastime    ends. Kids have to go to lessons  to school  do homework and of course they take piano or ballet lessons  but they aren't fun anymore. You're told to do it and there's competition. How can it be fun  If you're in elementary school and you still draw on the wall  you'll surely get in trouble with your mom. Besides  if you continue to act like an artist as you get older  you'll increasingly feel pressure    people will question your actions and ask you to act properly. Here's my story  I was an eighth grader and I entered a drawing contest at school in Gyeongbokgung. I was trying my best  and my teacher came around and asked me   What are you doing    I'm drawing diligently   I said.  Why are you using only black   Indeed  I was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black. And I explained   It's a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch.  Then my teacher said   Really  Well  Young ha  you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling.  Or so I wished.  Now you'll get it  you rascal   was the response.  Laughter   You'll get it   he said. You were supposed to draw the palace  the Gyeonghoeru  etc.  but I was coloring everything in black  so he dragged me out of the group. There were a lot of girls there as well  so I was utterly mortified. None of my explanations or excuses were heard  and I really got it big time. If he was an ideal teacher  he would have responded like I said before   Young ha may not have a talent for drawing  but he has a gift for making up stories   and he would have encouraged me. But such a teacher is seldom found. Later  I grew up and went to Europe's galleries    I was a university student    and I thought this was really unfair. Look what I found.  Laughter  Works like this were hung in Basel while I was punished and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth. Look at this. Doesn't it look just like wallpaper  Contemporary art  I later discovered  isn't explained by a lame story like mine. No crows are brought up. Most of the works have no title  Untitled. Anyways  contemporary art in the   th century is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation    essentially the same as I did. Of course  my work was very amateur  but let's turn to more famous examples. This is Picasso's. He stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it  Bull's Head.  Sounds convincing  right  Next  a urinal was placed on its side and called  Fountain . That was Duchamp. So filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories    that's indeed what contemporary art is all about. Picasso even made the statement   I draw not what I see but what I think.  Yes  it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru. I wish I knew what Picasso said back then. I could have argued better with my teacher. Unfortunately  the little artists within us are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art. They get locked in. That's our tragedy. So what happens when little artists get locked in  banished or even killed  Our artistic desire doesn't go away. We want to express  to reveal ourselves  but with the artist dead  the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form. In karaoke bars  there are always people who sing  She's Gone  or  Hotel California   miming the guitar riffs. Usually they sound awful. Awful indeed. Some people turn into rockers like this. Or some people dance in clubs. People who would have enjoyed telling stories end up trolling on the Internet all night long. That's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side. Sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids playing with Legos or putting together plastic robots. They go   Don't touch it. Daddy will do it for you.  The kid has already lost interest and is doing something else  but the dad alone builds castles. This shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed  not gone. But they can often reveal themselves negatively  in the form of jealousy. You know the song  I would love to be on TV   Why would we love it  TV is full of people who do what we wished to do  but never got to. They dance  they act    and the more they do  they are praised. So we start to envy them. We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.  He just can't act.   You call that singing  She can't hit the notes.  We easily say these sorts of things. We get jealous  not because we're evil  but because we have little artists pent up inside us. That's what I think. What should we do then  Yes  that's right. Right now  we need to start our own art. Right this minute  we can turn off TV  log off the Internet  get up and start to do something. Where I teach students in drama school  there's a course called Dramatics. In this course  all students must put on a play. However  acting majors are not supposed to act. They can write the play  for example  and the writers may work on stage art. Likewise  stage art majors may become actors  and in this way you put on a show. Students at first wonder whether they can actually do it  but later they have so much fun. I rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play. In school  the military or even in a mental institution  once you make people do it  they enjoy it. I saw this happen in the army    many people had fun doing plays. I have another experience  In my writing class  I give students a special assignment. I have students like you in the class    many who don't major in writing. Some major in art or music and think they can't write. So I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme. It can be a simple theme  Write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood. There's one condition  You must write like crazy. Like crazy  I walk around and encourage them   Come on  come on   They have to write like crazy for an hour or two. They only get to think for the first five minutes. The reason I make them write like crazy is because when you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind  the artistic devil creeps in. This devil will tell you hundreds of reasons why you can't write   People will laugh at you. This is not good writing  What kind of sentence is this  Look at your handwriting   It will say a lot of things. You have to run fast so the devil can't catch up. The really good writing I've seen in my class was not from the assignments with a long deadline  but from the     to    minute crazy writing students did in front of me with a pencil. The students go into a kind of trance. After    or    minutes  they write without knowing what they're writing. And in this moment  the nagging devil disappears. So I can say this  It's not the hundreds of reasons why one can't be an artist  but rather  the one reason one must be that makes us artists. Why we cannot be something is not important. Most artists became artists because of the one reason. When we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art  enemies appear on the outside. Mostly  they have the faces of our parents.  Laughter  Sometimes they look like our spouses  but they are not your parents or spouses. They are devils. Devils. They came to Earth briefly transformed to stop you from being artistic  from becoming artists. And they have a magic question. When we say   I think I'll try acting. There's a drama school in the community center   or  I'd like to learn Italian songs   they ask   Oh  yeah  A play  What for   The magic question is   What for   But art is not for anything. Art is the ultimate goal. It saves our souls and makes us live happily. It helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs. So in response to such a pragmatic question  we need to be bold.  Well  just for the fun of it. Sorry for having fun without you   is what you should say.  I'll just go ahead and do it anyway.  The ideal future I imagine is where we all have multiple identities  at least one of which is an artist. Once I was in New York and got in a cab. I took the backseat  and in front of me I saw something related to a play. So I asked the driver   What is this   He said it was his profile.  Then what are you   I asked.  An actor   he said. He was a cabby and an actor. I asked   What roles do you usually play   He proudly said he played King Lear. King Lear.  Who is it that can tell me who I am      a great line from King Lear. That's the world I dream of. Someone is a golfer by day and writer by night. Or a cabby and an actor  a banker and a painter  secretly or publicly performing their own arts. In       Martha Graham  the legend of modern dance  came to Korea. The great artist  then in her   s  arrived at Gimpo Airport and a reporter asked her a typical question   What do you have to do to become a great dancer  Any advice for aspiring Korean dancers   Now  she was the master. This photo was taken in      and she was already a celebrated artist. In       she was asked this question. And here's what she answered   Just do it.  Wow. I was touched. Only those three words and she left the airport. That's it. So what should we do now  Let's be artists  right now. Right away. How  Just do it  Thank you. The kind of neuroscience that I do and my colleagues do is almost like the weatherman. We are always chasing storms. We want to see and measure storms    brainstorms  that is. And we all talk about brainstorms in our daily lives  but we rarely see or listen to one. So I always like to start these talks by actually introducing you to one of them. Actually  the first time we recorded more than one neuron    a hundred brain cells simultaneously    we could measure the electrical sparks of a hundred cells in the same animal  this is the first image we got  the first    seconds of this recording. So we got a little snippet of a thought  and we could see it in front of us. I always tell the students that we could also call neuroscientists some sort of astronomer  because we are dealing with a system that is only comparable in terms of number of cells to the number of galaxies that we have in the universe. And here we are  out of billions of neurons  just recording     years ago  a hundred. We are doing a thousand now. And we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature. Because  if you don't know yet  everything that we use to define what human nature is comes from these storms  comes from these storms that roll over the hills and valleys of our brains and define our memories  our beliefs  our feelings  our plans for the future. Everything that we ever do  everything that every human has ever done  do or will do  requires the toil of populations of neurons producing these kinds of storms. And the sound of a brainstorm  if you've never heard one  is somewhat like this. You can put it louder if you can. My son calls this  making popcorn while listening to a badly tuned A.M. station.  This is a brain. This is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker and you listen to a hundred brain cells firing  your brain will sound like this    my brain  any brain. And what we want to do as neuroscientists in this time is to actually listen to these symphonies  these brain symphonies  and try to extract from them the messages they carry. In particular  about    years ago we created a preparation that we named brain machine interfaces. And you have a scheme here that describes how it works. The idea is  let's have some sensors that listen to these storms  this electrical firing  and see if you can  in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal    about half a second    let's see if we can read these signals  extract the motor messages that are embedded in it  translate it into digital commands and send it to an artificial device that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time. And see if we can measure how well we can translate that message when we compare to the way the body does that. And if we can actually provide feedback  sensory signals that go back from this robotic  mechanical  computational actuator that is now under the control of the brain  back to the brain  how the brain deals with that  of receiving messages from an artificial piece of machinery. And that's exactly what we did    years ago. We started with a superstar monkey called Aurora that became one of the superstars of this field. And Aurora liked to play video games. As you can see here  she likes to use a joystick  like any one of us  any of our kids  to play this game. And as a good primate  she even tries to cheat before she gets the right answer. So even before a target appears that she's supposed to cross with the cursor that she's controlling with this joystick  Aurora is trying to find the target  no matter where it is. And if she's doing that  because every time she crosses that target with the little cursor  she gets a drop of Brazilian orange juice. And I can tell you  any monkey will do anything for you if you get a little drop of Brazilian orange juice. Actually any primate will do that. Think about that. Well  while Aurora was playing this game  as you saw  and doing a thousand trials a day and getting    percent correct and     milliliters of orange juice  we are recording the brainstorms that are produced in her head and sending them to a robotic arm that was learning to reproduce the movements that Aurora was making. Because the idea was to actually turn on this brain machine interface and have Aurora play the game just by thinking  without interference of her body. Her brainstorms would control an arm that would move the cursor and cross the target. And to our shock  that's exactly what Aurora did. She played the game without moving her body. So every trajectory that you see of the cursor now  this is the exact first moment she got that. That's the exact first moment a brain intention was liberated from the physical domains of a body of a primate and could act outside  in that outside world  just by controlling an artificial device. And Aurora kept playing the game  kept finding the little target and getting the orange juice that she wanted to get  that she craved for. Well  she did that because she  at that time  had acquired a new arm. The robotic arm that you see moving here    days later  after the first video that I showed to you  is under the control of Aurora's brain and is moving the cursor to get to the target. And Aurora now knows that she can play the game with this robotic arm  but she has not lost the ability to use her biological arms to do what she pleases. She can scratch her back  she can scratch one of us  she can play another game. By all purposes and means  Aurora's brain has incorporated that artificial device as an extension of her body. The model of the self that Aurora had in her mind has been expanded to get one more arm. Well  we did that    years ago. Just fast forward    years. Just last year we realized that you don't even need to have a robotic device. You can just build a computational body  an avatar  a monkey avatar. And you can actually use it for our monkeys to either interact with them  or you can train them to assume in a virtual world the first person perspective of that avatar and use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar's arms or legs. And what we did basically was to train the animals to learn how to control these avatars and explore objects that appear in the virtual world. And these objects are visually identical  but when the avatar crosses the surface of these objects  they send an electrical message that is proportional to the microtactile texture of the object that goes back directly to the monkey's brain  informing the brain what it is the avatar is touching. And in just four weeks  the brain learns to process this new sensation and acquires a new sensory pathway    like a new sense. And you truly liberate the brain now because you are allowing the brain to send motor commands to move this avatar. And the feedback that comes from the avatar is being processed directly by the brain without the interference of the skin. So what you see here is this is the design of the task. You're going to see an animal basically touching these three targets. And he has to select one because only one carries the reward  the orange juice that they want to get. And he has to select it by touch using a virtual arm  an arm that doesn't exist. And that's exactly what they do. This is a complete liberation of the brain from the physical constraints of the body and the motor in a perceptual task. The animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets. And he's sensing the texture by receiving an electrical message directly in the brain. And the brain is deciding what is the texture associated with the reward. The legends that you see in the movie don't appear for the monkey. And by the way  they don't read English anyway  so they are here just for you to know that the correct target is shifting position. And yet  they can find them by tactile discrimination  and they can press it and select it. So when we look at the brains of these animals  on the top panel you see the alignment of     cells showing what happens with the brain activity  the electrical storms  of this sample of neurons in the brain when the animal is using a joystick. And that's a picture that every neurophysiologist knows. The basic alignment shows that these cells are coding for all possible directions. The bottom picture is what happens when the body stops moving and the animal starts controlling either a robotic device or a computational avatar. As fast as we can reset our computers  the brain activity shifts to start representing this new tool  as if this too was a part of that primate's body. The brain is assimilating that too  as fast as we can measure. So that suggests to us that our sense of self does not end at the last layer of the epithelium of our bodies  but it ends at the last layer of electrons of the tools that we're commanding with our brains. Our violins  our cars  our bicycles  our soccer balls  our clothing    they all become assimilated by this voracious  amazing  dynamic system called the brain. How far can we take it  Well  in an experiment that we ran a few years ago  we took this to the limit. We had an animal running on a treadmill at Duke University on the East Coast of the United States  producing the brainstorms necessary to move. And we had a robotic device  a humanoid robot  in Kyoto  Japan at ATR Laboratories that was dreaming its entire life to be controlled by a brain  a human brain  or a primate brain. What happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey was transmitted to Japan and made this robot walk while footage of this walking was sent back to Duke  so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her. So she could be rewarded  not by what her body was doing but for every correct step of the robot on the other side of the planet controlled by her brain activity. Funny thing  that round trip around the globe took    milliseconds less than it takes for that brainstorm to leave its head  the head of the monkey  and reach its own muscle. The monkey was moving a robot that was six times bigger  across the planet. This is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously. This is CB  fulfilling its dream in Japan under the control of the brain activity of a primate. So where are we taking all this  What are we going to do with all this research  besides studying the properties of this dynamic universe that we have between our ears  Well the idea is to take all this knowledge and technology and try to restore one of the most severe neurological problems that we have in the world. Millions of people have lost the ability to translate these brainstorms into action  into movement. Although their brains continue to produce those storms and code for movements  they cannot cross a barrier that was created by a lesion on the spinal cord. So our idea is to create a bypass  is to use these brain machine interfaces to read these signals  larger scale brainstorms that contain the desire to move again  bypass the lesion using computational microengineering and send it to a new body  a whole body called an exoskeleton  a whole robotic suit that will become the new body of these patients. And you can see an image produced by this consortium. This is a nonprofit consortium called the Walk Again Project that is putting together scientists from Europe  from here in the United States  and in Brazil together to work to actually get this new body built    a body that we believe  through the same plastic mechanisms that allow Aurora and other monkeys to use these tools through a brain machine interface and that allows us to incorporate the tools that we produce and use in our daily life. This same mechanism  we hope  will allow these patients  not only to imagine again the movements that they want to make and translate them into movements of this new body  but for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls. So I was told about    years ago that this would never happen  that this was close to impossible. And I can only tell you that as a scientist  I grew up in southern Brazil in the mid '  s watching a few crazy guys telling  us  that they would go to the Moon. And I was five years old  and I never understood why NASA didn't hire Captain Kirk and Spock to do the job  after all  they were very proficient    but just seeing that as a kid made me believe  as my grandmother used to tell me  that  impossible is just the possible that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true.  So they told me that it's impossible to make someone walk. I think I'm going to follow my grandmother's advice. Thank you. The global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that's actually one of the oldest questions in economics  dating back to at least before Adam Smith. And that is  why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions can display radically different savings behavior  Now  many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question  and as a field we've made a tremendous amount of headway and we understand a lot about this. What I'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new findings that I've been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak and how you find yourself with the propensity to save. Let me tell you a little bit about savings rates  a little bit about language  and then I'll draw that connection. Let's start by thinking about the member countries of the OECD  or the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. OECD countries  by and large  you should think about these as the richest  most industrialized countries in the world. And by joining the OECD  they were affirming a common commitment to democracy  open markets and free trade. Despite all of these similarities  we see huge differences in savings behavior. So all the way over on the left of this graph  what you see is many OECD countries saving over a quarter of their GDP every year  and some OECD countries saving over a third of their GDP per year. Holding down the right flank of the OECD  all the way on the other side  is Greece. And what you can see is that over the last    years  Greece has barely managed to save more than    percent of their GDP. It should be noted  of course  that the United States and the U.K. are the next in line. Now that we see these huge differences in savings rates  how is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences  Let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ. Linguists and cognitive scientists have been exploring this question for many years now. And then I'll draw the connection between these two behaviors. Many of you have probably already noticed that I'm Chinese. I grew up in the Midwest of the United States. And something I realized quite early on was that the Chinese language forced me to speak about and    in fact  more fundamentally than that    ever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways. Now  how might that be  Let me give you an example. Suppose I were talking with you and I was introducing you to my uncle. You understood exactly what I just said in English. If we were speaking Mandarin Chinese with each other  though  I wouldn't have that luxury. I wouldn't have been able to convey so little information. What my language would have forced me to do  instead of just telling you   This is my uncle   is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information. My language would force me to tell you whether or not this was an uncle on my mother's side or my father's side  whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth  and if this man was my father's brother  whether he was older than or younger than my father. All of this information is obligatory. Chinese doesn't let me ignore it. And in fact  if I want to speak correctly  Chinese forces me to constantly think about it. Now  that fascinated me endlessly as a child  but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time. So for example  if I'm speaking in English  I have to speak grammatically differently if I'm talking about past rain   It rained yesterday   current rain   It is raining now   or future rain   It will rain tomorrow.  Notice that English requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events. Why  Because I have to consider that and I have to modify what I'm saying to say   It will rain   or  It's going to rain.  It's simply not permissible in English to say   It rain tomorrow.  In contrast to that  that's almost exactly what you would say in Chinese. A Chinese speaker can basically say something that sounds very strange to an English speaker's ears. They can say   Yesterday it rain    Now it rain    Tomorrow it rain.  In some deep sense  Chinese doesn't divide up the time spectrum in the same way that English forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly. Is this difference in languages only between very  very distantly related languages  like English and Chinese  Actually  no. So many of you know  in this room  that English is a Germanic language. What you may not have realized is that English is actually an outlier. It is the only Germanic language that requires this. For example  most other Germanic language speakers feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow by saying   Morgen regnet es   quite literally to an English ear   It rain tomorrow.  This led me  as a behavioral economist  to an intriguing hypothesis. Could how you speak about time  could how your language forces you to think about time  affect your propensity to behave across time  You speak English  a futured language. And what that means is that every time you discuss the future  or any kind of a future event  grammatically you're forced to cleave that from the present and treat it as if it's something viscerally different. Now suppose that that visceral difference makes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak. If that's true and it makes the future feel like something more distant and more different from the present  that's going to make it harder to save. If  on the other hand  you speak a futureless language  the present and the future  you speak about them identically. If that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically  that's going to make it easier to save. Now this is a fanciful theory. I'm a professor  I get paid to have fanciful theories. But how would you actually go about testing such a theory  Well  what I did with that was to access the linguistics literature. And interestingly enough  there are pockets of futureless language speakers situated all over the world. This is a pocket of futureless language speakers in Northern Europe. Interestingly enough  when you start to crank the data  these pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world turn out to be  by and large  some of the world's best savers. Just to give you a hint of that  let's look back at that OECD graph that we were talking about. What you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the OECD that speak futured languages. What is the average difference here  Five percentage points of your GDP saved per year. Over    years that has huge long run effects on the wealth of your nation. Now while these findings are suggestive  countries can be different in so many different ways that it's very  very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences. What I'm going to show you  though  is something that I've been engaging in for a year  which is trying to gather all of the largest datasets that we have access to as economists  and I'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences  hoping to get this relationship to break. And just in summary  no matter how far I push this  I can't get it to break. Let me show you how far you can do that. One way to imagine that is I gather large datasets from around the world. So for example  there is the Survey of Health   Aging  and Retirement in Europe. From this dataset you actually learn that retired European families are extremely patient with survey takers. So imagine that you're a retired household in Belgium and someone comes to your front door.  Excuse me  would you mind if I peruse your stock portfolio  Do you happen to know how much your house is worth  Do you mind telling me  Would you happen to have a hallway that's more than    meters long  If you do  would you mind if I timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway  Would you mind squeezing as hard as you can  in your dominant hand  this device so I can measure your grip strength  How about blowing into this tube so I can measure your lung capacity   The survey takes over a day. Combine that with a Demographic and Health Survey collected by USAID in developing countries in Africa  for example  which that survey actually can go so far as to directly measure the HIV status of families living in  for example  rural Nigeria. Combine that with a world value survey  which measures the political opinions and  fortunately for me  the savings behaviors of millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world. Take all of that data  combine it  and this map is what you get. What you find is nine countries around the world that have significant native populations which speak both futureless and futured languages. And what I'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that I can measure  and then I'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels. What are the characteristics we can control for  Well I'm going to match families on country of birth and residence  the demographics    what sex  their age    their income level within their own country  their educational achievement  a lot about their family structure. It turns out there are six different ways to be married in Europe. And most granularly  I break them down by religion where there are    categories of religions in the world    so an extreme level of granularity. There are  .  billion different ways that a family can find itself. Now effectively everything I'm going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families. It's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment of finding two families both of whom live in Brussels who are identical on every single one of these dimensions  but one of whom speaks Flemish and one of whom speaks French  or two families that live in a rural district in Nigeria  one of whom speaks Hausa and one of whom speaks Igbo. Now even after all of this granular level of control  do futureless language speakers seem to save more  Yes  futureless language speakers  even after this level of control  are    percent more likely to report having saved in any given year. Does this have cumulative effects  Yes  by the time they retire  futureless language speakers  holding constant their income  are going to retire with    percent more in savings. Can we push this data even further  Yes  because I just told you  we actually collect a lot of health data as economists. Now how can we think about health behaviors to think about savings  Well  think about smoking  for example. Smoking is in some deep sense negative savings. If savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure  smoking is just the opposite. It's current pleasure in exchange for future pain. What we should expect then is the opposite effect. And that's exactly what we find. Futureless language speakers are    to    percent less likely to be smoking at any given point in time compared to identical families  and they're going to be    to    percent less likely to be obese by the time they retire  and they're going to report being    percent more likely to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter. I could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find. It's almost impossible not to find a savings behavior for which this strong effect isn't present. My linguistics and economics colleagues at Yale and I are just starting to do this work and really explore and understand the ways that these subtle nudges cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak. Ultimately  the goal  once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making  we want to be able to provide people tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers and more conscious investors in their own future. Thank you very much. Okay  this morning I'm speaking on the question of corruption. And corruption is defined as the abuse of a position of trust for the benefit of yourself    or  in the case of our context  your friends  your family or your financiers. Okay  Friends  family and financiers. But we need to understand what we understand about corruption  and we need to understand that we have been miseducated about it  and we have to admit that. We have to have the courage to admit that to start changing how we deal with it. The first thing is that the big myth  number one  is that in fact it's not really a crime. When we get together with friends and family and we discuss crime in our country  crime in Belmont or crime in Diego or crime in Marabella  nobody's speaking about corruption. That's the honest truth. When the Commissioner of Police comes on TV to talk about crime  he isn't speaking about corruption. And we know for sure when the Minister of National Security is speaking about crime  he's not talking about corruption either. The point I'm making is that it is a crime. It is an economic crime  because we're involving the looting of taxpayers' money. Public and private corruption is a reality. As somebody who comes from the private sector  I can tell you there's a massive amount of corruption in the private sector that has nothing to do with government. The same bribes and backhanders and things that take place under the table  it all takes place in the private sector. Today  I'm focusing on public sector corruption  which the private sector also participates in. The second important myth to understand    because we have to destroy these myths  dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them    the second important myth to understand is the one that says that in fact corruption is only a small problem    if it is a problem  it's only a small problem  that in fact it's only a little    or    percent  it's been going on forever  it probably will continue forever  and there's no point passing any laws  because there's little we can do about it. And I want to demonstrate that that  too  is a dangerous myth  very dangerous. It's a piece of public mischief. And I want to speak a little bit  take us back about    years. We're coming out today from Trinidad and Tobago  a resource rich  small Caribbean country  and in the early     s we had a massive increase in the country's wealth  and that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices. We call them petrodollars. The treasury was bursting with money. And it's ironic  because we're standing today in the Central Bank. You see  history's rich in irony. We're standing today in the Central Bank  and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I'm going to be speaking about. Okay  We're talking about irresponsibility in public office. We're speaking about the fact that across the terrace  the next tower is the Ministry of Finance  and there's a lot of connection with us today  so we're speaking within your temple today. Okay  The first thing I want to talk about is that when all of this money flowed into our country about    years ago  we embarked  the government of the day embarked on a series of government to government arrangements to have rapidly develop the country. And some of the largest projects in the country were being constructed through government to government arrangements with some of the leading countries in the world  the United States and Britain and France and so on and so on. As I said  even this building we're standing in    that's one of the ironies    this building was part of that series of complexes  what they called the Twin Towers. It became so outrageous  the whole situation  that in fact a commission of inquiry was appointed  and it reported in          years ago it reported    the Ballah Report       years ago  and immediately the government to government arrangements were stopped. The then Prime Minister went to Parliament to give a budget speech  and he said some things that I'll never forget. They went right in here. I was a young man at the time. It went right into my heart. And he said that  in fact   Let me see if this thing works. Are we getting a  yeah   That's what he told us. He told us that  in fact  two out of every three dollars of our petrodollars that we spent  the taxpayers' money  was wasted or stolen. So the    or    percent is pure mischief. As we say  it's a nancy story. Forget it. That's for little children. We are big people  and we're trying to deal with what's happening in our society. Okay  This is the size of the problem. Okay  Two thirds of the money stolen or wasted. That was    years ago.      was Ballah. So what has changed  I don't like to bring up embarrassing secrets to an international audience  but I have to. Four months ago  we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country. We call it the Section    fiasco  the Section    fiasco  a suspicious piece of law  and I'm going to say it like it is  a suspicious piece of law was passed at a suspicious time to free some suspects.  Laughter  And it was called  those people are called the Piarco Airport accused. I'm going to have my own lexicon speaking here today. They are the Piarco Airport accused. It was a constitutional outrage of the first order  and I have labeled it the Plot to Pervert Parliament. Our highest institution in our country was perverted. We are dealing with perverts here of an economic and financial nature. Do you get how serious this problem is  There was massive protest. A lot of us in this room took part in the protest in different forms. Most importantly  the American embassy complained  so Parliament was swiftly reconvened  and the law was reversed  it was repealed. That's the word lawyers use. It was repealed. But the point is that Parliament was outwitted in the whole course of events  because what really happened is that  because of the suspicious passage of that law  the law was actually passed into effect on the weekend we celebrated our   th anniversary of independence  our jubilee of independence. So that is the kind of outrage of the thing. It was kind of a nasty way to get maturation  but we got it  because we all understood it  and for the first time that I could remember  there were mass protests against this corruption. And that gave me a lot of hope. Okay  Those of us who are  sometimes you feel like you're a little bit on your own doing some of this work. That passage of the law and the repeal of the law fortified the case of the Piarco Airport accused. So it was one of those really superior double bluff kind of things that took place. But what were they accused of  What was it that they were accused of  I'm being a bit mysterious for those of you out there. What were they accused of  We were trying to build  or reconstruct largely  an airport that had grown outdated. The entire project cost about  .  billion dollars  Trinidad and Tobago dollars  and in fact  we had a lot of bid rigging and suspicious activity  corrupt activity took place. And to get an idea of what it consisted of  and to put it in context in relationship to this whole second myth about it being no big thing  we can look at this second slide here. And what we have here    I am not saying so  this is the Director of Public Prosecutions in a written statement. He said so. And he's telling us that for the   .  billion cost of the project  one billion dollars has been traced to offshore bank accounts. One billion dollars of our taxpayers' money has been located in offshore bank accounts. Being the kind of suspicious person I am  I am outraged at that  and I'm going to pause here  I'm going to pause now and again and bring in different things. I'm going to pause here and bring in something I saw in November last year at Wall Street. I was at Zuccotti Park. It was autumn. It was cool. It was damp. It was getting dark. And I was walking around with the protesters looking at the One Wall Street  Occupy Wall Street movement walking around. And there was a lady with a sign  a very simple sign  a kind of battered looking blonde lady  and the sign was made out of Bristol board  as we say in these parts  and it was made with a marker. And what it said on that sign hit me right in the center. It said   If you're not outraged  you haven't been paying attention.  If you're not outraged by all of this  you haven't been paying attention. So listen up  because we're getting into even deeper waters. My brain started thinking. Well  what if    because I'm suspicious like that. I read a lot of spy novels and stuff. What if     Laughter  But to make it in these wrongs  you have to read a lot of spy novels and follow some of that stuff  right   Laughter  But what if this wasn't the first time  What if this is just the first time that the so and sos had been caught  What if it had happened before  How would I find out  Now  the previous two examples I gave were to do with construction sector corruption  okay  And I have the privilege at this time to lead the Joint Consultative Council  which is a not for profit. We're at jcc.org.tt  and we have the    we are the leaders in the struggle to produce a new public procurement system about how public money is transacted. So those of you interested in finding out more about it  or joining us or signing up on any of our petitions  please get involved. But I'm going to segue to another thing that relates  because one of my private campaigns I've been conducting for over three and a half years is for transparency and accountability around the bailout of CL Financial. CL Financial is the Caribbean's largest ever conglomerate  okay  And without getting into all of the details  it is said to have collapsed   I'm using my words very carefully   it's said to have collapsed in January of '    which is just coming up to nearly four years. In an unprecedented fit of generosity    and you have to be very suspicious about these people    in an unprecedented   and I'm using that word carefully   unprecedented fit of generosity  the government of the day signed  made a written commitment  to repay all of the creditors. And I can tell you without fear of contradiction that hasn't happened anywhere else on the planet. Let's understand  because we lack context. People are telling us it's just like Wall Street. It's not just like Wall Street. Trinidad and Tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something. It's not just like anywhere.  Applause  It's not just like anywhere. It's not just like anywhere. Here is here  and out there is out there. Okay  I'm serious now. Listen. They've had bailouts on Wall Street. They've had bailouts in London. They've had bailouts in Europe. In Africa  they've had bailouts. In Nigeria  six of the major commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours  eh  It's interesting to parallel how the Nigerian experience has    how they've treated it  and they've treated it very well compared to us. Nowhere on the planet have all the creditors been bailed out in excess of what their statutory entitlements were. Only here. So what was the reason for the generosity  Is our government that generous  And maybe they are. Let's look at it. Let's look into it. So I started digging and writing and so and so on  and that work can be found  my personal work can be found at AfraRaymond.com  which is my name. It's a not for profit blog that I run. Not as popular as some of the other people  but there you go. But the point is that the bitter experience of Section     that plot to pervert Parliament  that bitter experience that took place in August  when we were supposed to be celebrating our independence  going into September  forced me to check myself and recalculate my bearings  and to go back into some of the work  some of the stuff I'd written and some of the exchanges I'd had with the officials to see what was really what. As we say in Trinidad and Tobago  who is who and what is what  Okay  We want to try to recalculate. And I made a Freedom of Information application in May this year to the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance is the next tower over. This is the other context. The Ministry of Finance  we are told  is subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. I'm going to take you through a worked example of whether that's really so. The Central Bank in which we stand this morning is immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. So in fact  you can't ask them anything  and they don't have to answer anything. That is the law since     . So I plunged into this struggle  and I asked four questions. And I'll relate the questions to you in the short form with the reply  so you could understand  as I said  where we are. Here is not like anywhere else. Question number one  I asked to see the accounts of CL Financial  and if you can't show me the accounts    the Minister of Finance is making statements  passing new laws and giving speeches and so on. What are the figures he's relying on  It's like that joke  I want whatever he's drinking. And they wrote back and said to me  well what do you really mean  So they hit my question with a question. Second point  I want to see who are the creditors of the group who have been repaid  Let me pause here to point out to you all that    billion dollars of our money has been spent on this. That is about three and a half billion U.S. dollars coming out of a small    we used to be resource rich    Caribbean country. Okay  And I asked the question  who was getting that three and a half billion dollars  And I want to pause again to bring up context  because context helps us to get clarity understanding this thing. There's a particular individual who is in the government now. The name of the person doesn't matter. And that person made a career out of using the Freedom of Information Act to advance his political cause. Okay  His name isn't important. I wouldn't dignify it. I'm on a point. The point is  that person made a career out of using the Freedom of Information Act to advance his cause. And the most famous case was what we came to call the Secret Scholarship Scandal  where in fact there was about    million dollars in government money that had been dispersed in a series of scholarships  and the scholarships hadn't been advertised  and so and so on and so on. And he was able to get the court  using that act of Parliament  Freedom of Information Act  to release the information  and I thought that was excellent. Fantastic. But you see  the question is this  If it's right and proper for us to use the Freedom of Information Act and to use the court to force a disclosure about    million dollars in public money  it must be right and proper for us to force a disclosure about    billion dollars. You see  But the Ministry of Finance  the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance  wrote me and said to me  that information is exempt too. You see  This is what we're dealing with  okay  The third thing I will tell you is that I also asked for the directors of CL Financial  whether in fact they were making filings under our Integrity in Public Life Act. We have an Integrity in Public Life Act as part of our framework supposed to safeguard the nation's interest. And public officials are supposed to file to say what it is they have in terms of assets and liabilities. And of course I've since discovered that they're not filing  and in fact the Minister of Finance has not even asked them to file. So here we have it. We have a situation where the basic safeguards of integrity and accountability and transparency have all been discarded. I've asked the question in the legal and required fashion. It's been ignored. The sort of thing that motivated us around Section     we need to continue to work on that. We can't forget it. I have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country's history. It's also the single largest example of public corruption according to this equation. And this is my reality check. Where you have an expenditure of public money and it is without accountability and it's without transparency  it will always be equal to corruption  whether you're in Russia or Nigeria or Alaska  it will always be equal to corruption  and that is what we are dealing with here. I'm going to continue the work to press on  to get some resolution of those matters at the Ministry of Finance. If it is I have to go to court personally  I will do that. We will continue to press on. We will continue to work within JCC. But I want to step back from the Trinidad and Tobago context and bring something new to the table in terms of an international example. We had the journalist  Heather  Brooke speaking about her battle against government corruption  and she introduced me to this website  Alaveteli.com. And Alaveteli.com is a way for us to have an open database for Freedom of Information applications  and speak with each other. I could see what you're applying for. You could see what I applied for and what replies I got. We can work on it together. We need to build a collective database and a collective understanding of where we are to go to the next point. We need to increase the consciousness. The final thing I want to say is in relation to this one  which is a lovely website from India called IPaidABribe.com. They have international branches  and it's important for us to tune into this one. IPaidABribe.com is really important  a good one to log on to and see. I'm going to pause there. I'm going to ask you for your courage. Discard the first myth  it is a crime. Discard the second myth  it is a big thing. It's a huge problem. It's an economic crime. And let us continue working together to betterment in this situation  stability and sustainability in our society. Thank you. Radical openness is still a distant future in the field of school education. We have such a hard time figuring out that learning is not a place but an activity. But I want to tell you the story of PISA  OECD's test to measure the knowledge and skills of    year olds around the world  and it's really a story of how international comparisons have globalized the field of education that we usually treat as an affair of domestic policy. Look at how the world looked in the     s  in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school. You can see the United States ahead of everyone else  and much of the economic success of the United States draws on its long standing advantage as the first mover in education. But in the     s  some countries caught up. In the     s  the global expansion of the talent pool continued. And the world didn't stop in the     s. So in the '  s  the U.S. was first. In the '  s  it was   th  and not because standards had fallen  but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere. Korea shows you what's possible in education. Two generations ago  Korea had the standard of living of Afghanistan today  and was one of the lowest education performers. Today  every young Korean finishes high school. So this tells us that  in a global economy  it is no longer national improvement that's the benchmark for success  but the best performing education systems internationally. The trouble is that measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have got is not always a good way of seeing what they can actually do. Look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets  while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need. And that tells you that better degrees don't automatically translate into better skills and better jobs and better lives. So with PISA  we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of people directly. And we took a very special angle to this. We were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school  but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations. Now  some people have criticized us for this. They say  you know  such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people  because we test students with problems they haven't seen before. But if you take that logic  you know  you should consider life unfair  because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school  but whether we are prepared for change  whether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created  to use technologies that haven't been invented  to solve problems we just can't anticipate today. And once hotly contested  our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard. In our latest assessment in       we measured    school systems that together cover    percent of the economy. This chart shows you the performance of countries. In red  sort of below OECD average. Yellow is so so  and in green are the countries doing really well. You can see Shanghai  Korea  Singapore in Asia  Finland in Europe  Canada in North America doing really well. You can also see that there is a gap of almost three and a half school years between    year olds in Shanghai and    year olds in Chile  and the gap grows to seven school years when you include the countries with really poor performance. There's a world of difference in the way in which young people are prepared for today's economy. But I want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture. Educators like to talk about equity. With PISA  we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity  in terms of ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances. And we see that in some countries  the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very  very strong. Opportunities are unequally distributed. A lot of potential of young children is wasted. We see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you're born. We all want to be there  in the upper right quadrant  where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed. Nobody  and no country  can afford to be there  where performance is poor and there are large social disparities. And then we can debate  you know  is it better to be there  where performance is strong at the price of large disparities  Or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity  But actually  if you look at how countries come out on this picture  you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity. In fact  one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you don't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence. These countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all  a very important lesson. And that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people. And ever since those results came out  policymakers  educators  researchers from around the world have tried to figure out what's behind the success of those systems. But let's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started PISA  and I'm giving them a colored bubble now. And I'm making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students. If money would tell you everything about the quality of learning outcomes  you would find all the large bubbles at the top  no  But that's not what you see. Spending per student only explains about  well  less than    percent of the performance variation among countries  and Luxembourg  for example  the most expensive system  doesn't do particularly well. What you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results. You also see    and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings    that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well educated countries  and poor and badly educated ones  a very  very important lesson. Let's look at this in greater detail. The red dot shows you spending per student relative to a country's wealth. One way you can spend money is by paying teachers well  and you can see Korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession. And Korea also invests into long school days  which drives up costs further. Last but not least  Koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop. They invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things. All that costs money. How can Korea afford all of this  The answer is  students in Korea learn in large classes. This is the blue bar which is driving costs down. You go to the next country on the list  Luxembourg  and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea  so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does. But  you know  parents and teachers and policymakers in Luxembourg all like small classes. You know  it's very pleasant to walk into a small class. So they have invested all their money into there  and the blue bar  class size  is driving costs up. But even Luxembourg can spend its money only once  and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well. Students don't have long hours of learning. And basically  teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching. So you can see two countries spent their money very differently  and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education. Let's go back to the year     . Remember  that was the year before the iPod was invented. This is how the world looked then in terms of PISA performance. The first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller  no  We spent a lot less on education  about    percent less on education. So you ask yourself  if education has become so much more expensive  has it become so much better  And the bitter truth really is that  you know  not in many countries. But there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements. Germany  my own country  in the year       featured in the lower quadrant  below average performance  large social disparities. And remember  Germany  we used to be one of those countries that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees. Very disappointing results. People were stunned by the results. And for the very first time  the public debate in Germany was dominated for months by education  not tax  not other kinds of issues  but education was the center of the public debate. And then policymakers began to respond to this. The federal government dramatically raised its investment in education. A lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage. And what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about optimizing existing policies  but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying German education. For example  traditionally  the education of the very young children was seen as the business of families  and you would have cases where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children to kindergarten. PISA has transformed that debate  and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in Germany. Or traditionally  the German education divides children at the age of     very young children  between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers  and that mainly along socioeconomic lines  and that paradigm is being challenged now too. A lot of change. And the good news is  nine years later  you can see improvements in quality and equity. People have taken up the challenge  done something about it. Or take Korea  at the other end of the spectrum. In the year       Korea did already very well  but the Koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence. They took up the challenge  and Korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading. Well  if you only focus on your brightest students  you know what happens is disparities grow  and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction  but still  an impressive improvement. A major overhaul of Poland's education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools  turn around many of the lowest performing schools  and raise performance by over half a school year. And you can see other countries as well. Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system  raise quality and improve equity  and so did Hungary. So what you can actually see  there's been a lot of change. And even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like PISA is just an artifact of culture  of economic factors  of social issues  of homogeneity of societies  and so on  these people must now concede that education improvement is possible. You know  Poland hasn't changed its culture. It didn't change its economy. It didn't change the compositions of its population. It didn't fire its teachers. It changed its education policies and practice. Very impressive. And all that raises  of course  the question  What can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity  high levels of performance  and raised outcomes  And  of course  the question is  can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere  Of course  you can't copy and paste education systems wholesale  but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high performing systems share. Everybody agrees that education is important. Everybody says that. But the test of truth is  how do you weigh that priority against other priorities  How do countries pay their teachers relative to other highly skilled workers  Would you want your child to become a teacher rather than a lawyer  How do the media talk about schools and teachers  Those are the critical questions  and what we have learned from PISA is that  in high performing education systems  the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education  their future  more than consumption today. And you know what's interesting  You won't believe it  but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school. Those things really exist. But placing a high value on education is just part of the picture. The other part is the belief that all children are capable of success. You have some countries where students are segregated early in their ages. You know  students are divided up  reflecting the belief that only some children can achieve world class standards. But usually that is linked to very strong social disparities. If you go to Japan in Asia  or Finland in Europe  parents and teachers in those countries expect every student to succeed  and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior. When we asked students what counts for success in mathematics  students in North America would typically tell us  you know  it's all about talent. If I'm not born as a genius in math  I'd better study something else. Nine out of    Japanese students say that it depends on my own investment  on my own effort  and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them. In the past  different students were taught in similar ways. High performers on PISA embrace diversity with differentiated pedagogical practices. They realize that ordinary students have extraordinary talents  and they personalize learning opportunities. High performing systems also share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum. Every student knows what matters. Every student knows what's required to be successful. And nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers. High performing systems are very careful in how they recruit and select their teachers and how they train them. They watch how they improve the performances of teachers in difficulties who are struggling  and how they structure teacher pay. They provide an environment also in which teachers work together to frame good practice. And they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers. In bureaucratic school systems  teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching. High performing systems are very clear what good performance is. They set very ambitious standards  but then they enable their teachers to figure out  what do I need to teach to my students today  The past was about delivered wisdom in education. Now the challenge is to enable user generated wisdom. High performers have moved on from professional or from administrative forms of accountability and control    sort of  how do you check whether people do what they're supposed to do in education    to professional forms of work organization. They enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy. They provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pedagogical practices. The goal of the past was standardization and compliance. High performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive. In the past  the policy focus was on outcomes  on provision. The high performing systems have helped teachers and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher  the next school around their lives. And the most impressive outcomes of world class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system. You've seen Finland doing so well on PISA  but what makes Finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools. Every school succeeds. This is where success is systemic. And how do they do that  They invest resources where they can make the most difference. They attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools  and the most talented teachers into the most challenging classroom. Last but not least  those countries align policies across all areas of public policy. They make them coherent over sustained periods of time  and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented. Now  knowing what successful systems are doing doesn't yet tell us how to improve. That's also clear  and that's where some of the limits of international comparisons of PISA are. That's where other forms of research need to kick in  and that's also why PISA doesn't venture into telling countries what they should be doing. But its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing. And the example of PISA shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy through which we usually run education systems. You know  some people argue that changing educational administration is like moving graveyards. You just can't rely on the people out there to help you with this.  Laughter  But PISA has shown what's possible in education. It has helped countries to see that improvement is possible. It has taken away excuses from those who are complacent. And it has helped countries to set meaningful targets in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world's leaders. If we can help every child  every teacher  every school  every principal  every parent see what improvement is possible  that only the sky is the limit to education improvement  we have laid the foundations for better policies and better lives. Thank you. I grew up watching Star Trek. I love Star Trek. Star Trek made me want to see alien creatures  creatures from a far distant world. But basically  I figured out that I could find those alien creatures right on Earth. And what I do is I study insects. I'm obsessed with insects  particularly insect flight. I think the evolution of insect flight is perhaps one of the most important events in the history of life. Without insects  there'd be no flowering plants. Without flowering plants  there would be no clever  fruit eating primates giving TED Talks. Now  David and Hidehiko and Ketaki gave a very compelling story about the similarities between fruit flies and humans  and there are many similarities  and so you might think that if humans are similar to fruit flies  the favorite behavior of a fruit fly might be this  for example    but in my talk  I don't want to emphasize on the similarities between humans and fruit flies  but rather the differences  and focus on the behaviors that I think fruit flies excel at doing. And so I want to show you a high speed video sequence of a fly shot at       frames per second in infrared lighting  and to the right  off screen  is an electronic looming predator that is going to go at the fly. The fly is going to sense this predator. It is going to extend its legs out. It's going to sashay away to live to fly another day. Now I have carefully cropped this sequence to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink  so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye  the fly has seen this looming predator  estimated its position  initiated a motor pattern to fly it away  beating its wings at     times a second as it does so. I think this is a fascinating behavior that shows how fast the fly's brain can process information. Now  flight    what does it take to fly  Well  in order to fly  just as in a human aircraft  you need wings that can generate sufficient aerodynamic forces  you need an engine sufficient to generate the power required for flight  and you need a controller  and in the first human aircraft  the controller was basically the brain of Orville and Wilbur sitting in the cockpit. Now  how does this compare to a fly  Well  I spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out how insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air. And you might have heard how engineers proved that bumblebees couldn't fly. Well  the problem was in thinking that the insect wings function in the way that aircraft wings work. But they don't. And we tackle this problem by building giant  dynamically scaled model robot insects that would flap in giant pools of mineral oil where we could study the aerodynamic forces. And it turns out that the insects flap their wings in a very clever way  at a very high angle of attack that creates a structure at the leading edge of the wing  a little tornado like structure called a leading edge vortex  and it's that vortex that actually enables the wings to make enough force for the animal to stay in the air. But the thing that's actually most    so  what's fascinating is not so much that the wing has some interesting morphology. What's clever is the way the fly flaps it  which of course ultimately is controlled by the nervous system  and this is what enables flies to perform these remarkable aerial maneuvers. Now  what about the engine  The engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating. They have two types of flight muscle  so called power muscle  which is stretch activated  which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled on a contraction by contraction basis by the nervous system. It's specialized to generate the enormous power required for flight  and it fills the middle portion of the fly  so when a fly hits your windshield  it's basically the power muscle that you're looking at. But attached to the base of the wing is a set of little  tiny control muscles that are not very powerful at all  but they're very fast  and they're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing on a stroke by stroke basis  and this is what enables the fly to change its wing and generate the changes in aerodynamic forces which change its flight trajectory. And of course  the role of the nervous system is to control all this. So let's look at the controller. Now flies excel in the sorts of sensors that they carry to this problem. They have antennae that sense odors and detect wind detection. They have a sophisticated eye which is the fastest visual system on the planet. They have another set of eyes on the top of their head. We have no idea what they do. They have sensors on their wing. Their wing is covered with sensors  including sensors that sense deformation of the wing. They can even taste with their wings. One of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has is a structure called the halteres. The halteres are actually gyroscopes. These devices beat back and forth about     hertz during flight  and the animal can use them to sense its body rotation and initiate very  very fast corrective maneuvers. But all of this sensory information has to be processed by a brain  and yes  indeed  flies have a brain  a brain of about         neurons. Now several people at this conference have already suggested that fruit flies could serve neuroscience because they're a simple model of brain function. And the basic punchline of my talk is  I'd like to turn that over on its head. I don't think they're a simple model of anything. And I think that flies are a great model. They're a great model for flies. And let's explore this notion of simplicity. So I think  unfortunately  a lot of neuroscientists  we're all somewhat narcissistic. When we think of brain  we of course imagine our own brain. But remember that this kind of brain  which is much  much smaller   instead of     billion neurons  it has         neurons   but this is the most common form of brain on the planet and has been for     million years. And is it fair to say that it's simple  Well  it's simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons  but is that a fair metric  And I would propose it's not a fair metric. So let's sort of think about this. I think we have to compare    we have to compare the size of the brain with what the brain can do. So I propose we have a Trump number  and the Trump number is the ratio of this man's behavioral repertoire to the number of neurons in his brain. We'll calculate the Trump number for the fruit fly. Now  how many people here think the Trump number is higher for the fruit fly  It's a very smart  smart audience. Yes  the inequality goes in this direction  or I would posit it. Now I realize that it is a little bit absurd to compare the behavioral repertoire of a human to a fly. But let's take another animal just as an example. Here's a mouse. A mouse has about       times as many neurons as a fly. I used to study mice. When I studied mice  I used to talk really slowly. And then something happened when I started to work on flies. And I think if you compare the natural history of flies and mice  it's really comparable. They have to forage for food. They have to engage in courtship. They have sex. They hide from predators. They do a lot of the similar things. But I would argue that flies do more. So for example  I'm going to show you a sequence  and I have to say  some of my funding comes from the military  so I'm showing this classified sequence and you cannot discuss it outside of this room. Okay  So I want you to look at the payload at the tail of the fruit fly. Watch it very closely  and you'll see why my six year old son now wants to be a neuroscientist. Wait for it. Pshhew. So at least you'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice  they're at least as clever as pigeons.  Laughter  Now  I want to get across that it's not just a matter of numbers but also the challenge for a fly to compute everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons. So this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse that came from Jeff Lichtman's lab  and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk. But up in the corner  in the right corner  you'll see  at the same scale  a visual interneuron from a fly. And I'll expand this up. And it's a beautifully complex neuron. It's just very  very tiny  and there's lots of biophysical challenges with trying to compute information with tiny  tiny neurons. How small can neurons get  Well  look at this interesting insect. It looks sort of like a fly. It has wings  it has eyes  it has antennae  its legs  complicated life history  it's a parasite  it has to fly around and find caterpillars to parasatize  but not only is its brain the size of a salt grain  which is comparable for a fruit fly  it is the size of a salt grain. So here's some other organisms at the similar scale. This animal is the size of a paramecium and an amoeba  and it has a brain of       neurons that's so small    you know these things called cell bodies you've been hearing about  where the nucleus of the neuron is  This animal gets rid of them because they take up too much space. So this is a session on frontiers in neuroscience. I would posit that one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works. But let's think about this. How can you make a small number of neurons do a lot  And I think  from an engineering perspective  you think of multiplexing. You can take a hardware and have that hardware do different things at different times  or have different parts of the hardware doing different things. And these are the two concepts I'd like to explore. And they're not concepts that I've come up with  but concepts that have been proposed by others in the past. And one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs. And I don't mean chewing the crabs. I grew up in Baltimore  and I chew crabs very  very well. But I'm talking about the crabs actually doing the chewing. Crab chewing is actually really fascinating. Crabs have this complicated structure under their carapace called the gastric mill that grinds their food in a variety of different ways. And here's an endoscopic movie of this structure. The amazing thing about this is that it's controlled by a really tiny set of neurons  about two dozen neurons that can produce a vast variety of different motor patterns  and the reason it can do this is that this little tiny ganglion in the crab is actually inundated by many  many neuromodulators. You heard about neuromodulators earlier. There are more neuromodulators that alter  that innervate this structure than actually neurons in the structure  and they're able to generate a complicated set of patterns. And this is the work by Eve Marder and her many colleagues who've been studying this fascinating system that show how a smaller cluster of neurons can do many  many  many things because of neuromodulation that can take place on a moment by moment basis. So this is basically multiplexing in time. Imagine a network of neurons with one neuromodulator. You select one set of cells to perform one sort of behavior  another neuromodulator  another set of cells  a different pattern  and you can imagine you could extrapolate to a very  very complicated system. Is there any evidence that flies do this  Well  for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world  we've been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators. You can tether a fly to a little stick. You can measure the aerodynamic forces it's creating. You can let the fly play a little video game by letting it fly around in a visual display. So let me show you a little tiny sequence of this. Here's a fly and a large infrared view of the fly in the flight simulator  and this is a game the flies love to play. You allow them to steer towards the little stripe  and they'll just steer towards that stripe forever. It's part of their visual guidance system. But very  very recently  it's been possible to modify these sorts of behavioral arenas for physiologies. So this is the preparation that one of my former post docs  Gaby Maimon  who's now at Rockefeller  developed  and it's basically a flight simulator but under conditions where you actually can stick an electrode in the brain of the fly and record from a genetically identified neuron in the fly's brain. And this is what one of these experiments looks like. It was a sequence taken from another post doc in the lab  Bettina Schnell. The green trace at the bottom is the membrane potential of a neuron in the fly's brain  and you'll see the fly start to fly  and the fly is actually controlling the rotation of that visual pattern itself by its own wing motion  and you can see this visual interneuron respond to the pattern of wing motion as the fly flies. So for the first time we've actually been able to record from neurons in the fly's brain while the fly is performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight. And one of the lessons we've been learning is that the physiology of cells that we've been studying for many years in quiescent flies is not the same as the physiology of those cells when the flies actually engage in active behaviors like flying and walking and so forth. And why is the physiology different  Well it turns out it's these neuromodulators  just like the neuromodulators in that little tiny ganglion in the crabs. So here's a picture of the octopamine system. Octopamine is a neuromodulator that seems to play an important role in flight and other behaviors. But this is just one of many neuromodulators that's in the fly's brain. So I really think that  as we learn more  it's going to turn out that the whole fly brain is just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion  and that's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons. Now  another idea  another way of multiplexing is multiplexing in space  having different parts of a neuron do different things at the same time. So here's two sort of canonical neurons from a vertebrate and an invertebrate  a human pyramidal neuron from Ramon y Cajal  and another cell to the right  a non spiking interneuron  and this is the work of Alan Watson and Malcolm Burrows many years ago  and Malcolm Burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea based on the fact that this neuron from a locust does not fire action potentials. It's a non spiking cell. So a typical cell  like the neurons in our brain  has a region called the dendrites that receives input  and that input sums together and will produce action potentials that run down the axon and then activate all the output regions of the neuron. But non spiking neurons are actually quite complicated because they can have input synapses and output synapses all interdigitated  and there's no single action potential that drives all the outputs at the same time. So there's a possibility that you have computational compartments that allow the different parts of the neuron to do different things at the same time. So these basic concepts of multitasking in time and multitasking in space  I think these are things that are true in our brains as well  but I think the insects are the true masters of this. So I hope you think of insects a little bit differently next time  and as I say up here  please think before you swat. So here's the good news about families. The last    years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family. We have blended families  adopted families  we have nuclear families living in separate houses and divorced families living in the same house. But through it all  the family has grown stronger. Eight in    say the family they have today is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in. Now  here's the bad news. Nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed by the chaos of family life. Every parent I know  myself included  feels like we're constantly playing defense. Just when our kids stop teething  they start having tantrums. Just when they stop needing our help taking a bath  they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying. And here's the worst news of all. Our children sense we're out of control. Ellen Galinsky of the Families and Work Institute asked       children   If you were granted one wish about your parents  what would it be   The parents predicted the kids would say  spending more time with them. They were wrong. The kids' number one wish  That their parents be less tired and less stressed. So how can we change this dynamic  Are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress  draw our family closer  and generally prepare our children to enter the world  I spent the last few years trying to answer that question  traveling around  meeting families  talking to scholars  experts ranging from elite peace negotiators to Warren Buffett's bankers to the Green Berets. I was trying to figure out  what do happy families do right and what can I learn from them to make my family happier  I want to tell you about one family that I met  and why I think they offer clues. At   p.m. on a Sunday in Hidden Springs  Idaho  where the six members of the Starr family are sitting down to the highlight of their week  the family meeting. The Starrs are a regular American family with their share of regular American family problems. David is a software engineer. Eleanor takes care of their four children  ages    to   . One of those kids tutors math on the far side of town. One has lacrosse on the near side of town. One has Asperger syndrome. One has ADHD.  We were living in complete chaos   Eleanor said. What the Starrs did next  though  was surprising. Instead of turning to friends or relatives  they looked to David's workplace. They turned to a cutting edge program called agile development that was just spreading from manufacturers in Japan to startups in Silicon Valley. In agile  workers are organized into small groups and do things in very short spans of time. So instead of having executives issue grand proclamations  the team in effect manages itself. You have constant feedback. You have daily update sessions. You have weekly reviews. You're constantly changing. David said when they brought this system into their home  the family meetings in particular increased communication  decreased stress  and made everybody happier to be part of the family team. When my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques into the lives of our then five year old twin daughters  it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born. And these meetings had this effect while taking under    minutes. So what is Agile  and why can it help with something that seems so different  like families  In       Jeff Sutherland was a technologist at a financial firm in New England. He was very frustrated with how software got designed. Companies followed the waterfall method  right  in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down to programmers below  and no one had ever consulted the programmers. Eighty three percent of projects failed. They were too bloated or too out of date by the time they were done. Sutherland wanted to create a system where ideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom and be adjusted in real time. He read    years of Harvard Business Review before stumbling upon an article in      called  The New New Product Development Game.  It said that the pace of business was quickening    and by the way  this was in         and the most successful companies were flexible. It highlighted Toyota and Canon and likened their adaptable  tight knit teams to rugby scrums. As Sutherland told me  we got to that article  and said   That's it.  In Sutherland's system  companies don't use large  massive projects that take two years. They do things in small chunks. Nothing takes longer than two weeks. So instead of saying   You guys go off into that bunker and come back with a cell phone or a social network   you say   You go off and come up with one element  then bring it back. Let's talk about it. Let's adapt.  You succeed or fail quickly. Today  agile is used in a hundred countries  and it's sweeping into management suites. Inevitably  people began taking some of these techniques and applying it to their families. You had blogs pop up  and some manuals were written. Even the Sutherlands told me that they had an Agile Thanksgiving  where you had one group of people working on the food  one setting the table  and one greeting visitors at the door. Sutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever. So let's take one problem that families face  crazy mornings  and talk about how agile can help. A key plank is accountability  so teams use information radiators  these large boards in which everybody is accountable. So the Starrs  in adapting this to their home  created a morning checklist in which each child is expected to tick off chores. So on the morning I visited  Eleanor came downstairs  poured herself a cup of coffee  sat in a reclining chair  and she sat there  kind of amiably talking to each of her children as one after the other they came downstairs  checked the list  made themselves breakfast  checked the list again  put the dishes in the dishwasher  rechecked the list  fed the pets or whatever chores they had  checked the list once more  gathered their belongings  and made their way to the bus. It was one of the most astonishing family dynamics I have ever seen. And when I strenuously objected this would never work in our house  our kids needed way too much monitoring  Eleanor looked at me.  That's what I thought   she said.  I told David  'keep your work out of my kitchen.' But I was wrong.  So I turned to David   So why does it work   He said   You can't underestimate the power of doing this.  And he made a checkmark. He said   In the workplace  adults love it. With kids  it's heaven.  The week we introduced a morning checklist into our house  it cut parental screaming in half.  Laughter  But the real change didn't come until we had these family meetings. So following the agile model  we ask three questions  What worked well in our family this week  what didn't work well  and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead  Everyone throws out suggestions and then we pick two to focus on. And suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters' mouths. What worked well this week  Getting over our fear of riding bikes. Making our beds. What didn't work well  Our math sheets  or greeting visitors at the door. Like a lot of parents  our kids are something like Bermuda Triangles. Like  thoughts and ideas go in  but none ever comes out  I mean at least not that are revealing. This gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts. But the most surprising part was when we turned to  what are we going to work on in the week ahead  You know  the key idea of agile is that teams essentially manage themselves  and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids. Our kids love this process. So they would come up with all these ideas. You know  greet five visitors at the door this week  get an extra    minutes of reading before bed. Kick someone  lose desserts for a month. It turns out  by the way  our girls are little Stalins. We constantly have to kind of dial them back. Now look  naturally there's a gap between their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week  but the truth is it didn't really bother us. It felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that wouldn't light up their world for many years to come. Three years later    our girls are almost eight now    We're still holding these meetings. My wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom. So what did we learn  The word  agile  entered the lexicon in      when Jeff Sutherland and a group of designers met in Utah and wrote a    point Agile Manifesto. I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto. I've taken some ideas from the Starrs and from many other families I met. I'm proposing three planks. Plank number one  Adapt all the time. When I became a parent  I figured  you know what  We'll set a few rules and we'll stick to them. That assumes  as parents  we can anticipate every problem that's going to arise. We can't. What's great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to what's happening to you in real time. It's like they say in the Internet world  if you're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago  you're doing the wrong thing. Parents can learn a lot from that. But to me   adapt all the time  means something deeper  too. We have to break parents out of this straitjacket that the only ideas we can try at home are ones that come from shrinks or self help gurus or other family experts. The truth is  their ideas are stale  whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas to make groups and teams work effectively. Let's just take a few examples. Let's take the biggest issue of all  family dinner. Everybody knows that having family dinner with your children is good for the kids. But for so many of us  it doesn't work in our lives. I met a celebrity chef in New Orleans who said   No problem  I'll just time shift family dinner. I'm not home  can't make family dinner  We'll have family breakfast. We'll meet for a bedtime snack. We'll make Sunday meals more important.  And the truth is  recent research backs him up. It turns out there's only    minutes of productive time in any family meal. The rest of it's taken up with  take your elbows off the table  and  pass the ketchup.  You can take that    minutes and move it to any part of the day and have the same benefit. So time shift family dinner. That's adaptability. An environmental psychologist told me   If you're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface  you'll be more rigid. If you're sitting on a cushioned chair  you'll be more open.  She told me   When you're discipling your children  sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface. The conversation will go better.  My wife and I actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations because I was sitting above in the power position. So move where you sit. That's adaptability. The point is there are all these new ideas out there. We've got to hook them up with parents. So plank number one  Adapt all the time. Be flexible  be open minded  let the best ideas win. Plank number two  Empower your children. Our instinct as parents is to order our kids around. It's easier  and frankly  we're usually right. There's a reason that few systems have been more waterfall over time than the family. But the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible. Enlist the children in their own upbringing. Just yesterday  we were having our family meeting  and we had voted to work on overreacting. So we said   Okay  give us a reward and give us a punishment. Okay   So one of my daughters threw out  you get five minutes of overreacting time all week. So we kind of liked that. But then her sister started working the system. She said   Do I get one five minute overreaction or can I get       second overreactions   I loved that. Spend the time however you want. Now give us a punishment. Okay. If we get    minutes of overreaction time  that's the limit. Every minute above that  we have to do one pushup. So you see  this is working. Now look  this system isn't lax. There's plenty of parental authority going on. But we're giving them practice becoming independent  which of course is our ultimate goal. Just as I was leaving to come here tonight  one of my daughters started screaming. The other one said   Overreaction  Overreaction   and started counting  and within    seconds it had ended. To me that is a certified agile miracle. And by the way  research backs this up too. Children who plan their own goals  set weekly schedules  evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex and take more control over their lives. The point is  we have to let our children succeed on their own terms  and yes  on occasion  fail on their own terms. I was talking to Warren Buffett's banker  and he was chiding me for not letting my children make mistakes with their allowance. And I said   But what if they drive into a ditch   He said   It's much better to drive into a ditch with a    allowance than a         a year salary or a    million inheritance.  So the bottom line is  empower your children. Plank number three  Tell your story. Adaptability is fine  but we also need bedrock. Jim Collins  the author of  Good To Great   told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common  they preserve the core  they stimulate progress. So agile is great for stimulating progress  but I kept hearing time and again  you need to preserve the core. So how do you do that  Collins coached us on doing something that businesses do  which is define your mission and identify your core values. So he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement. We did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat. We had a pajama party. I made popcorn. Actually  I burned one  so I made two. My wife bought a flip chart. And we had this great conversation  like  what's important to us  What values do we most uphold  And we ended up with    statements. We are travelers  not tourists. We don't like dilemmas. We like solutions. Again  research shows that parents should spend less time worrying about what they do wrong and more time focusing on what they do right  worry less about the bad times and build up the good times. This family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right. A few weeks later  we got a call from the school. One of our daughters had gotten into a spat. And suddenly we were worried  like  do we have a mean girl on our hands  And we didn't really know what to do  so we called her into my office. The family mission statement was on the wall  and my wife said   So  anything up there seem to apply   And she kind of looked down the list  and she said   Bring people together   Suddenly we had a way into the conversation. Another great way to tell your story is to tell your children where they came from. Researchers at Emory gave children a simple  what do you know  test. Do you know where your grandparents were born  Do you know where your parents went to high school  Do you know anybody in your family who had a difficult situation  an illness  and they overcame it  The children who scored highest on this  do you know  scale had the highest self esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives. The  do you know  test was the single biggest predictor of emotional health and happiness. As the author of the study told me  children who have a sense of    they're part of a larger narrative have greater self confidence. So my final plank is  tell your story. Spend time retelling the story of your family's positive moments and how you overcame the negative ones. If you give children this happy narrative  you give them the tools to make themselves happier. I was a teenager when I first read  Anna Karenina  and its famous opening sentence   All happy families are alike. Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.  When I first read that  I thought   That sentence is inane. Of course all happy families aren't alike.  But as I began working on this project  I began changing my mind. Recent scholarship has allowed us  for the first time  to identify the building blocks that successful families have. I've mentioned just three here today  Adapt all the time  empower the children  tell your story. Is it possible  all these years later  to say Tolstoy was right  The answer  I believe  is yes. When Leo Tolstoy was five years old  his brother Nikolay came to him and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness on a little green stick  which he had hidden in a ravine on the family's estate in Russia. If the stick were ever found  all humankind would be happy. Tolstoy became consumed with that stick  but he never found it. In fact  he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden. He still lies there today  covered in a layer of green grass. That story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that I learned  Happiness is not something we find  it's something we make. Almost anybody who's looked at well run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion. Greatness is not a matter of circumstance. It's a matter of choice. You don't need some grand plan. You don't need a waterfall. You just need to take small steps  accumulate small wins  keep reaching for that green stick. In the end  this may be the greatest lesson of all. What's the secret to a happy family  Try. What is going to be the future of learning  I do have a plan  but in order for me to tell you what that plan is  I need to tell you a little story  which kind of sets the stage. I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools  where did it come from  And you can look far back into the past  but if you look at present day schooling the way it is  it's quite easy to figure out where it came from. It came from about     years ago  and it came from the last and the biggest of the empires on this planet.   The British Empire   Imagine trying to run the show  trying to run the entire planet  without computers  without telephones  with data handwritten on pieces of paper  and traveling by ships. But the Victorians actually did it. What they did was amazing. They created a global computer made up of people. It's still with us today. It's called the bureaucratic administrative machine. In order to have that machine running  you need lots and lots of people. They made another machine to produce those people  the school. The schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine. They must be identical to each other. They must know three things  They must have good handwriting  because the data is handwritten  they must be able to read  and they must be able to do multiplication  division  addition and subtraction in their head. They must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand and ship them to Canada and he would be instantly functional. The Victorians were great engineers. They engineered a system that was so robust that it's still with us today  continuously producing identical people for a machine that no longer exists. The empire is gone  so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people  and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it    Schools as we know them are obsolete   So that's a pretty strong comment there. I said schools as we know them now  they're obsolete. I'm not saying they're broken. It's quite fashionable to say that the education system's broken. It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed. It's just that we don't need it anymore. It's outdated. What are the kind of jobs that we have today  Well  the clerks are the computers. They're there in thousands in every office. And you have people who guide those computers to do their clerical jobs. Those people don't need to be able to write beautifully by hand. They don't need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads. They do need to be able to read. In fact  they need to be able to read discerningly. Well  that's today  but we don't even know what the jobs of the future are going to look like. We know that people will work from wherever they want  whenever they want  in whatever way they want. How is present day schooling going to prepare them for that world  Well  I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident. I used to teach people how to write computer programs in New Delhi     years ago. And right next to where I used to work  there was a slum. And I used to think  how on Earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs  Or should they not  At the same time  we also had lots of parents  rich people  who had computers  and who used to tell me   You know  my son  I think he's gifted  because he does wonderful things with computers. And my daughter    oh  surely she is extra intelligent.  And so on. So I suddenly figured that  how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children  What did the poor do wrong  I made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office  and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one  didn't know any English  didn't know what the Internet was. The children came running in. It was three feet off the ground  and they said   What is this   And I said   Yeah  it's  I don't know.  They said   Why have you put it there   I said   Just like that.  And they said   Can we touch it  I said   If you wish to.  And I went away. About eight hours later  we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse. So I said   Well that's impossible  because    How is it possible  They don't know anything.  My colleagues said   No  it's a simple solution. One of your students must have been passing by  showed them how to use the mouse.  So I said   Yeah  that's possible.  So I repeated the experiment. I went     miles out of Delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software development engineer was very little.  Laughter  I repeated the experiment there. There was no place to stay  so I stuck my computer in  I went away  came back after a couple of months  found kids playing games on it. When they saw me  they said   We want a faster processor and a better mouse.  So I said   How on Earth do you know all this   And they said something very interesting to me. In an irritated voice  they said   You've given us a machine that works only in English  so we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it.   Laughter  That's the first time  as a teacher  that I had heard the word  teach ourselves  said so casually. Here's a short glimpse from those years. That's the first day at the Hole in the Wall. On your right is an eight year old. To his left is his student. She's six. And he's teaching her how to browse. Then onto other parts of the country  I repeated this over and over again  getting exactly the same results that we were.   Hole in the wall film          An eight year old telling his elder sister what to do. And finally a girl explaining in Marathi what it is  and said   There's a processor inside.  So I started publishing. I published everywhere. I wrote down and measured everything  and I said  in nine months  a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West. I'd seen it happen over and over and over again. But I was curious to know  what else would they do if they could do this much  I started experimenting with other subjects  among them  for example  pronunciation. There's one community of children in southern India whose English pronunciation is really bad  and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs. I gave them a speech to text engine in a computer  and I said   Keep talking into it until it types what you say.  They did that  and watch a little bit of this. Computer  Nice to meet you.Child  Nice to meet you. Sugata Mitra  The reason I ended with the face of this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her. She has now joined a call center in Hyderabad and may have tortured you about your credit card bills in a very clear English accent. So then people said  well  how far will it go  Where does it stop  I decided I would destroy my own argument by creating an absurd proposition. I made a hypothesis  a ridiculous hypothesis. Tamil is a south Indian language  and I said  can Tamil speaking children in a south Indian village learn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English from a streetside computer  And I said  I'll measure them. They'll get a zero. I'll spend a couple of months  I'll leave it for a couple of months  I'll go back  they'll get another zero. I'll go back to the lab and say  we need teachers. I found a village. It was called Kallikuppam in southern India. I put in Hole in the Wall computers there  downloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication  most of which I didn't understand. The children came rushing  said   What's all this   So I said   It's very topical  very important. But it's all in English.  So they said   How can we understand such big English words and diagrams and chemistry   So by now  I had developed a new pedagogical method  so I applied that. I said   I haven't the foggiest idea.   And anyway  I am going away.  So I left them for a couple of months. They'd got a zero. I gave them a test. I came back after two months and the children trooped in and said   We've understood nothing.  So I said   Well  what did I expect   So I said   Okay  but how long did it take you before you decided that you can't understand anything   So they said   We haven't given up. We look at it every single day.  So I said   What  You don't understand these screens and you keep staring at it for two months  What for   So a little girl who you see just now  she raised her hand  and she says to me in broken Tamil and English  she said   Well  apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease  we haven't understood anything else.  So I tested them. I got an educational impossibility  zero to    percent in two months in the tropical heat with a computer under the tree in a language they didn't know doing something that's a decade ahead of their time. Absurd. But I had to follow the Victorian norm. Thirty percent is a fail. How do I get them to pass  I have to get them    more marks. I couldn't find a teacher. What I did find was a friend that they had  a    year old girl who was an accountant and she played with them all the time. So I asked this girl   Can you help them   So she says   Absolutely not. I didn't have science in school. I have no idea what they're doing under that tree all day long. I can't help you.  I said   I'll tell you what. Use the method of the grandmother.  So she says   What's that   I said   Stand behind them. Whenever they do anything  you just say  'Well  wow  I mean  how did you do that  What's the next page  Gosh  when I was your age  I could have never done that.' You know what grannies do.  So she did that for two more months. The scores jumped to    percent. Kallikuppam had caught up with my control school in New Delhi  a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher. When I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field. Here's Kallikuppam. I got the camera angle wrong. That one is just amateur stuff  but what she was saying  as you could make out  was about neurons  with her hands were like that  and she was saying neurons communicate. At   . So what are jobs going to be like  Well  we know what they're like today. What's learning going to be like  We know what it's like today  children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand. What will it be tomorrow  Could it be that we don't need to go to school at all  Could it be that  at the point in time when you need to know something  you can find out in two minutes  Could it be    a devastating question  a question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte    could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in a future where knowing is obsolete  But that's terrible. We are homo sapiens. Knowing  that's what distinguishes us from the apes. But look at it this way. It took nature     million years to make the ape stand up and become Homo sapiens. It took us only        to make knowing obsolete. What an achievement that is. But we have to integrate that into our own future. Encouragement seems to be the key. If you look at Kuppam  if you look at all of the experiments that I did  it was simply saying   Wow   saluting learning. There is evidence from neuroscience. The reptilian part of our brain  which sits in the center of our brain  when it's threatened  it shuts down everything else  it shuts down the prefrontal cortex  the parts which learn  it shuts all of that down. Punishment and examinations are seen as threats. We take our children  we make them shut their brains down  and then we say   Perform.  Why did they create a system like that  Because it was needed. There was an age in the Age of Empires when you needed those people who can survive under threat. When you're standing in a trench all alone  if you could have survived  you're okay  you've passed. If you didn't  you failed. But the Age of Empires is gone. What happens to creativity in our age  We need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure. I came back to England looking for British grandmothers. I put out notices in papers saying  if you are a British grandmother  if you have broadband and a web camera  can you give me one hour of your time per week for free  I got     in the first two weeks. I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe.  Laughter  They're called the Granny Cloud. The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet. If there's a child in trouble  we beam a Gran. She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out. I've seen them do it from a village called Diggles in northwestern England  deep inside a village in Tamil Nadu  India        miles away. She does it with only one age old gesture.  Shhh.  Okay  Watch this. Grandmother  You can't catch me. You say it. You can't catch me. Children  You can't catch me. Grandmother  I'm the Gingerbread Man.Children  I'm the Gingerbread Man. Grandmother  Well done  Very good. SM  So what's happening here  I think what we need to look at is we need to look at learning as the product of educational self organization. If you allow the educational process to self organize  then learning emerges. It's not about making learning happen. It's about letting it happen. The teacher sets the process in motion and then she stands back in awe and watches as learning happens. I think that's what all this is pointing at. But how will we know  How will we come to know  Well  I intend to build these Self Organized Learning Environments. They are basically broadband  collaboration and encouragement put together. I've tried this in many  many schools. It's been tried all over the world  and teachers sort of stand back and say   It just happens by itself   And I said   Yeah  it happens by itself.  How did you know that   I said   You won't believe the children who told me and where they're from.  Here's a SOLE in action. This one is in England. He maintains law and order  because remember  there's no teacher around. Girl  The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons    SM  Australia Girl     giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge. The net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons. SM  A decade ahead of her time. So SOLEs  I think we need a curriculum of big questions. You already heard about that. You know what that means. There was a time when Stone Age men and women used to sit and look up at the sky and say   What are those twinkling lights   They built the first curriculum  but we've lost sight of those wondrous questions. We've brought it down to the tangent of an angle. But that's not sexy enough. The way you would put it to a nine year old is to say   If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth  how would you figure out if it was going to or not   And if he says   Well  what  how   you say   There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle   and leave him alone. He'll figure it out. So here are a couple of images from SOLEs. I've tried incredible  incredible questions     When did the world begin  How will it end     to nine year olds. This one is about what happens to the air we breathe. This is done by children without the help of any teacher. The teacher only raises the question  and then stands back and admires the answer. So what's my wish  My wish is that we design the future of learning. We don't want to be spare parts for a great human computer  do we  So we need to design a future for learning. And I've got to    hang on  I've got to get this wording exactly right  because  you know  it's very important. My wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together. Help me build this school. It will be called the School in the Cloud. It will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures driven by the big questions which their mediators put in. The way I want to do this is to build a facility where I can study this. It's a facility which is practically unmanned. There's only one granny who manages health and safety. The rest of it's from the cloud. The lights are turned on and off by the cloud  etc.  etc.  everything's done from the cloud. But I want you for another purpose. You can do Self Organized Learning Environments at home  in the school  outside of school  in clubs. It's very easy to do. There's a great document produced by TED which tells you how to do it. If you would please  please do it across all five continents and send me the data  then I'll put it all together  move it into the School of Clouds  and create the future of learning. That's my wish. And just one last thing. I'll take you to the top of the Himalayas. At        feet  where the air is thin  I once built two Hole in the Wall computers  and the children flocked there. And there was this little girl who was following me around. And I said to her   You know  I want to give a computer to everybody  every child. I don't know  what should I do   And I was trying to take a picture of her quietly. She suddenly raised her hand like this  and said to me   Get on with it.  I think it was good advice. I'll follow her advice. I'll stop talking. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much. Wow.  Applause  Well  I was introduced as the former Governor of Michigan  but actually I'm a scientist. All right  a political scientist  it doesn't really count  but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy that is Michigan  and  like any good scientist  I was experimenting with policy about what would achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. But there were three problems  three enigmas that I could not solve  and I want to share with you those problems  but most importantly  I think I figured out a proposal for a solution. The first problem that not just Michigan  but every state  faces is  how do you create good jobs in America in a global economy  So let me share with you some empirical data from my lab. I was elected in      and  at the end of my first year in office in       I got a call from one of my staff members  who said   Gov  we have a big problem. We have a little tiny community called Greenville  Michigan  population        and they are about to lose their major employer  which is a refrigerator factory that's operated by Electrolux.  And I said   Well  how many people work at Electrolux   And he said         of the       people in Greenville.  So it is a one company town. And Electrolux was going to go to Mexico. So I said   Forget that. I'm the new Governor. We can fix this. We're going to go to Greenville with my whole cabinet and we will just make Electrolux an offer they can't refuse.  So I brought my whole cabinet  and we met with all of the pooh bahs of little Greenville    the mayor  the city manager  the head of the community college    and we basically emptied our pockets and put all of our chips on the table  incentives  you name it  to convince Electrolux to stay  and as we made our pile of chips  we slid them across the table to the management of Electrolux. And in the pile were things like zero taxes for    years  or that we'd help to build a new factory for the company  we'd help to finance it. The UAW  who represented the workers  said they would offer unprecedented concessions  sacrifices to just keep those jobs in Greenville. So the management of Electrolux took our pile  our list of incentives  and they went outside the room for    minutes  and they came back in and they said   Wow  this is the most generous any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here. But there's nothing you can do to compensate for the fact that we can pay   .   an hour in Juarez  Mexico. So we're leaving.  And they did. And when they did  it was like a nuclear bomb went off in little Greenville. In fact  they did implode the factory. That's a guy that is walking on his last day of work. And on the month that the last refrigerator rolled off the assembly line  the employees of Electrolux in Greenville  Michigan  had a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper. It was in a big pavilion in Greenville  an indoor pavilion  and I went to it because I was so frustrated as Governor that I couldn't stop the outflow of these jobs  and I wanted to grieve with them  and as I went into the room   there's thousands of people there. It was a just big thing. People were eating boxed lunches on roundtop tables  and there was a sad band playing music  or a band playing sad music  probably both.  Laughter  And this guy comes up to me  and he's got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on  and he had his two daughters with him  and he said   Gov  these are my two daughters.  He said   I'm    years old  and I have worked at this factory for    years. I went from high school to factory. My father worked at this factory   he said.  My grandfather worked at this factory. All I know is how to make refrigerators.  And he looked at his daughters  and he puts his hand on his chest  and he says   So  Gov  tell me  who is ever going to hire me  Who is ever going to hire me   And that was asked not just by that guy but by everyone in the pavilion  and frankly  by every worker at one of the        factories that closed in the first decade of this century. Enigma number one  How do you create jobs in America in a global economy  Number two  very quickly  How do you solve global climate change when we don't even have a national energy policy in this country and when gridlock in Congress seems to be the norm  In fact  there was a poll that was done recently and the pollster compared Congress's approval ratings to a number of other unpleasant things  and it was found  in fact  that Congress's approval rating is worse than cockroaches  lice  Nickelback the band  root canals and Donald Trump.  Laughter  But wait  the good news is it's at least better than meth labs and gonorrhea.  Laughter  We got a problem  folks. So it got me thinking  what is it  What in the laboratory that I see out there  the laboratories of democracy  what has happened  What policy prescriptions have happened that actually cause changes to occur and that have been accepted in a bipartisan way  So if I asked you  for example  what was the Obama Administration policy that caused massive changes across the country  what would you say  You might say Obamacare  except for those were not voluntary changes. As we know  only half the states have opted in. We might say the Recovery Act  but those didn't require policy changes. The thing that caused massive policy changes to occur was Race to the Top for education. Why  The government put a   .  billion pot and said to the governors across the country  compete for it. Forty eight governors competed  convincing    state legislatures to essentially raise standards for high schoolers so that they all take a college prep curriculum. Forty eight states opted in  creating a national  education  policy from the bottom up. So I thought  well  why can't we do something like that and create a clean energy jobs race to the top  Because after all  if you look at the context   .  trillion dollars has been invested in the past eight years from the private sector globally  and every dollar represents a job  and where are those jobs going  Well  they're going to places that have policy  like China. In fact  I was in China to see what they were doing  and they were putting on a dog and pony show for the group that I was with  and I was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations and standing next to one of the Chinese officials  and we were watching  and he says   So  Gov  when do you think the U.S. is going to get national energy policy   And I said   Oh my God    Congress  gridlock  who knows   And this is what he did  he goes  he says   Take your time.  Because they see our passivity as their opportunity. So what if we decided to create a challenge to the governors of the country  and the price to entry into this competition used the same amount that the bipartisan group approved in Congress for the Race to the Top for education   .  billion  which sounds like a lot  but actually it's less than one tenth of one percent of federal spending. It's a rounding error on the federal side. But price to entry into that competition would be  you could just  say  use the President's goal. He wants Congress to adopt a clean energy standard of    percent by       in other words  that you'd have to get    percent of your energy from clean sources by the year     . Why not ask all of the states to do that instead  And imagine what might happen  because every region has something to offer. You might take states like Iowa and Ohio    two very important political states  by the way    those two governors  and they would say  we're going to lead the nation in producing the wind turbines and the wind energy. You might say the solar states  the sun belt  we're going to be the states that produce solar energy for the country  and maybe Jerry Brown says   Well  I'm going to create an industry cluster in California to be able to produce the solar panels so that we're not buying them from China but we're buying them from the U.S.  In fact  every region of the country could do this. You see  you've got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation. In fact  if you look just at the upper and northern states in the West  they could do geothermal  or you could look at Texas and say  we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid. In the middle eastern states which have access to forests and to agricultural waste  they might say  we're going to lead the nation in biofuels. In the upper northeast  we're going to lead the nation in energy efficiency solutions. Along the eastern seaboard  we're going to lead the nation in offshore wind. You might look at Michigan and say  we're going to lead the nation in producing the guts for the electric vehicle  like the lithium ion battery. Every region has something to offer  and if you created a competition  it respects the states and it respects federalism. It's opt in. You might even get Texas and South Carolina  who didn't opt into the education Race to the Top  you might even get them to opt in. Why  Because Republican and Democratic governors love to cut ribbons. We want to bring jobs. I'm just saying. And it fosters innovation at the state level in these laboratories of democracy. Now  any of you who are watching anything about politics lately might say   Okay  great idea  but really  Congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table  They can't agree to anything.  So you could wait and go through Congress  although you should be very impatient. Or  you renegades  we could go around Congress. Go around Congress. What if we created a private sector challenge to the governors  What if several of the high net worth companies and individuals who are here at TED decided that they would create  band together  just a couple of them  and create a national competition to the governors to have a race to the top and see how the governors respond  What if it all started here at TED  What if you were here when we figured out how to crack the code to create good paying jobs in America     Applause     and get national energy policy and we created a national energy strategy from the bottom up  Because  dear TEDsters  if you are impatient like I am  you know that our economic competitors  our other nations  are in the game and are eating us for lunch. And we can get in the game or not. We can be at the table or we can be on the table. And I don't know about you  but I prefer to dine. Thank you all so much.  Applause  So  I didn't always make my living from music. For about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university  this was my day job. I was a self employed living statue called the Eight Foot Bride  and I love telling people I did this for a job  because everybody always wants to know  who are these freaks in real life. Hello. I painted myself white one day  stood on a box  put a hat or a can at my feet  and when someone came by and dropped in money  I handed them a flower    and some intense eye contact. And if they didn't take the flower  I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing    as they walked away. So I had the most profound encounters with people  especially lonely people who looked like they hadn't talked to anyone in weeks  and we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact being allowed in a city street  and we would sort of fall in love a little bit. And my eyes would say     Thank you. I see you.  And their eyes would say     Nobody ever sees me. Thank you.  I would get harassed sometimes. People would yell at me from their cars.  Get a job    This is my job.  But it hurt  because it made me fear that I was somehow doing something un joblike and unfair  shameful. I had no idea how perfect a real education I was getting for the music business on this box. And for the economists out there  you may be interested to know I actually made a pretty predictable income  which was shocking to me  given I had no regular customers  but pretty much    bucks on a Tuesday     bucks on a Friday. It was consistent. And meanwhile  I was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band  the Dresden Dolls. This was me on piano  a genius drummer. I wrote the songs  and eventually we started making enough money that I could quit being a statue  and as we started touring  I really didn't want to lose this sense of direct connection with people  because I loved it. So after all of our shows  we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people  and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us  and I would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows  and they would pass the hat  and then they would come in and join us onstage  so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird  random circus guests. And then Twitter came along  and made things even more magic  because I could ask instantly for anything anywhere. So I would need a piano to practice on  and an hour later I would be at a fan's house. This is in London. People would bring home cooked food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us. This is in Seattle. Fans who worked in museums and stores and any kind of public space would wave their hands if I would decide to do a last minute  spontaneous  free gig. This is a library in Auckland. On Saturday I tweeted for this crate and hat  because I did not want to schlep them from the East Coast  and they showed up care of this dude  Chris  from Newport Beach  who says hello. I once tweeted   Where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot   And a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe I was in  and I bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death. And I love this kind of random closeness  which is lucky  because I do a lot of couchsurfing. In mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there's no wireless  and in punk squats  everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with wireless  clearly making it the better option. My crew once pulled our van up to a really poor Miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was an    year old girl  still living at home  and her family were all undocumented immigrants from Honduras. And that night  her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds. And I lay there thinking  these people have so little. Is this fair  And in the morning  her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give me a Bible  and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English   Your music has helped my daughter so much. Thank you for staying here. We're all so grateful.  And I thought  this is fair. This is this. A couple of months later  I was in Manhattan  and I tweeted for a crash pad  and at midnight  I'm on the Lower East Side  and it occurs to me I've never actually done this alone. I've always been with my band or my crew. Is this what stupid people do  Is this how stupid people die  And before I can change my mind  the door busts open. She's an artist. He's a financial blogger for Reuters  and they're pouring me a glass of red wine and offering me a bath  and I have had thousands of nights like that and like that. So I couchsurf a lot. I also crowdsurf a lot. I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing. You're falling into the audience and you're trusting each other. I once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get some extra money  something that I did a lot. And as usual  the band was psyched  but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldn't bring himself to go out there. It felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat. And I recognized his fear of  Is this fair   and  Get a job.  And meanwhile  my band is becoming bigger and bigger. We sign with a major label. And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret. It's not for everybody. Well  maybe it's for you. We sign  and there's all this hype leading up to our next record. And it comes out and it sells about        copies in the first few weeks  and the label considers this a failure. I was like           isn't that a lot   They said   No  the sales are going down. It's a failure.  And they walk off. Right at this same time  I'm signing and hugging after a gig  and a guy comes up to me and hands me a     bill  and he says   I'm sorry  I burned your CD from a friend.   But I read your blog  I know you hate your label. I just want you to have this money.  And this starts happening all the time. I become the hat after my own gigs  but I have to physically stand there and take the help from people  and unlike the guy in the opening band  I've actually had a lot of practice standing there. Thank you. And this is the moment I decide I'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible  so it's like Metallica over here  Napster  bad  Amanda Palmer over here  and I'm going to encourage torrenting  downloading  sharing  but I'm going to ask for help  because I saw it work on the street. So I fought my way off my label  and for my next project with my new band  the Grand Theft Orchestra  I turned to crowdfunding. And I fell into those thousands of connections that I'd made  and I asked my crowd to catch me. And the goal was         dollars. My fans backed me at nearly  .  million  which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date. And you can see how many people it is. It's about        people. And the media asked   Amanda  the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy. How did you make all these people pay for music   And the real answer is  I didn't make them. I asked them. And through the very act of asking people  I'd connected with them  and when you connect with them  people want to help you. It's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists. They don't want to ask for things. But it's not easy. It's not easy to ask. And a lot of artists have a problem with this. Asking makes you vulnerable. And I got a lot of criticism online  after my Kickstarter went big  for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices  specifically for asking musicians who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer  and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website. And this hurt in a really familiar way. And people saying   You're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help   really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling   Get a job.  Because they weren't with us on the sidewalk  and they couldn't see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd  an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them. So this is slightly not safe for work. This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin. At the end of the night  I stripped and let everyone draw on me. Now let me tell you  if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers    I recommend this  especially if those strangers are drunk German people. This was a ninja master level fan connection  because what I was really saying here was  I trust you this much. Should I  Show me. For most of human history  musicians  artists  they've been part of the community. Connectors and openers  not untouchable stars. Celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance  but the Internet and the content that we're freely able to share on it are taking us back. It's about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough. So a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price. They see it as an unpredictable risk  but the things I've done  the Kickstarter  the street  the doorbell  I don't see these things as risk. I see them as trust. Now  the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street  they're getting there. But the perfect tools aren't going to help us if we can't face each other and give and receive fearlessly  but  more important    to ask without shame. My music career has been spent trying to encounter people on the Internet the way I could on the box. So blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers  our mistakes  and we see each other. And I think when we really see each other  we want to help each other. I think people have been obsessed with the wrong question  which is   How do we make people pay for music   What if we started asking   How do we let people pay for music   Thank you. The most massive tsunami perfect storm is bearing down upon us. This perfect storm is mounting a grim reality  increasingly grim reality  and we are facing that reality with the full belief that we can solve our problems with technology  and that's very understandable. Now  this perfect storm that we are facing is the result of our rising population  rising towards    billion people  land that is turning to desert  and  of course  climate change. Now there's no question about it at all  we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology. But fossil fuels  carbon    coal and gas    are by no means the only thing that is causing climate change. Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert  and this happens only when we create too much bare ground. There's no other cause. And I intend to focus on most of the world's land that is turning to desert. But I have for you a very simple message that offers more hope than you can imagine. We have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year. On those  it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground. No matter what you do  nature covers it up so quickly. And we have environments where we have months of humidity followed by months of dryness  and that is where desertification is occurring. Fortunately  with space technology now  we can look at it from space  and when we do  you can see the proportions fairly well. Generally  what you see in green is not desertifying  and what you see in brown is  and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth. About two thirds  I would guess  of the world is desertifying. I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert while    millimeters    that's an inch of rain    was falling. Think of it in terms of drums of water  each containing     liters. Over       drums of water fell on every hectare of that land that day. The next day  the land looked like this. Where had that water gone  Some of it ran off as flooding  but most of the water that soaked into the soil simply evaporated out again  exactly as it does in your garden if you leave the soil uncovered. Now  because the fate of water and carbon are tied to soil organic matter  when we damage soils  you give off carbon. Carbon goes back to the atmosphere. Now you're told over and over  repeatedly  that desertification is only occurring in arid and semi arid areas of the world  and that tall grasslands like this one in high rainfall are of no consequence. But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them  you find that most of the soil in that grassland that you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae  leading to increased runoff and evaporation. That is the cancer of desertification that we do not recognize till its terminal form. Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock  mostly cattle  sheep and goats  overgrazing the plants  leaving the soil bare and giving off methane. Almost everybody knows this  from nobel laureates to golf caddies  or was taught it  as I was. Now  the environments like you see here  dusty environments in Africa where I grew up  and I loved wildlife  and so I grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing. And then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs. Well  I have news for you. We were once just as certain that the world was flat. We were wrong then  and we are wrong again. And I want to invite you now to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery. When I was a young man  a young biologist in Africa  I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks. Now no sooner   this was in the     s   and no sooner did we remove the hunting  drum beating people to protect the animals  than the land began to deteriorate  as you see in this park that we formed. Now  no livestock were involved  but suspecting that we had too many elephants now  I did the research and I proved we had too many  and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain. Now  that was a terrible decision for me to have to make  and it was political dynamite  frankly. So our government formed a team of experts to evaluate my research. They did. They agreed with me  and over the following years  we shot        elephants to try to stop the damage. And it got worse  not better. Loving elephants as I do  that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life  and I will carry that to my grave. One good thing did come out of it. It made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions. When I came to the United States  I got a shock  to find national parks like this one desertifying as badly as anything in Africa. And there'd been no livestock on this land for over    years. And I found that American scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid and natural. So I then began looking at all the research plots I could over the whole of the Western United States where cattle had been removed to prove that it would stop desertification  but I found the opposite  as we see on this research station  where this grassland that was green in       by      had changed to that situation. And the authors of the position paper on climate change from which I obtained these pictures attribute this change to  unknown processes.  Clearly  we have never understood what is causing desertification  which has destroyed many civilizations and now threatens us globally. We have never understood it. Take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here  and I promise you  you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday than that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter  plant litter. You have changed the microclimate. Now  by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground on more than half the world's land  you are changing macroclimate. But we have just simply not understood why was it beginning to happen        years ago  Why has it accelerated lately  We had no understanding of that. What we had failed to understand was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world  the soil and the vegetation developed with very large numbers of grazing animals  and that these grazing animals developed with ferocious pack hunting predators. Now  the main defense against pack hunting predators is to get into herds  and the larger the herd  the safer the individuals. Now  large herds dung and urinate all over their own food  and they have to keep moving  and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants  while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil  as we see where a herd has passed. This picture is a typical seasonal grassland. It has just come through four months of rain  and it's now going into eight months of dry season. And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season. Now  all of that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growing season  and if it doesn't  the grassland and the soil begin to die. Now  if it does not decay biologically  it shifts to oxidation  which is a very slow process  and this smothers and kills grasses  leading to a shift to woody vegetation and bare soil  releasing carbon. To prevent that  we have traditionally used fire. But fire also leaves the soil bare  releasing carbon  and worse than that  burning one hectare of grassland gives off more  and more damaging  pollutants than       cars. And we are burning in Africa  every single year  more than one billion hectares of grasslands  and almost nobody is talking about it. We justify the burning  as scientists  because it does remove the dead material and it allows the plants to grow. Now  looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry  what could we do to keep that healthy  And bear in mind  I'm talking of most of the world's land now. Okay  We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causing desertification and climate change. We cannot burn it without causing desertification and climate change. What are we going to do  There is only one option  I'll repeat to you  only one option left to climatologists and scientists  and that is to do the unthinkable  and to use livestock  bunched and moving  as a proxy for former herds and predators  and mimic nature. There is no other alternative left to mankind. So let's do that. So on this bit of grassland  we'll do it  but just in the foreground. We'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature  and we've done so  and look at that. All of that grass is now covering the soil as dung  urine and litter or mulch  as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand  and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain  to store carbon  and to break down methane. And we did that  without using fire to damage the soil  and the plants are free to grow. When I first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification  I was faced with a real dilemma. How were we to do it  We'd had        years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunching and moving their animals  but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world. Then we'd had     years of modern rain science  and that had accelerated desertification  as we first discovered in Africa and then confirmed in the United States  and as you see in this picture of land managed by the federal government. Clearly more was needed than bunching and moving the animals  and humans  over thousands of years  had never been able to deal with nature's complexity. But we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this. So rather than reinvent the wheel  I began studying other professions to see if anybody had. And I found there were planning techniques that I could take and adapt to our biological need  and from those I developed what we call holistic management and planned grazing  a planning process  and that does address all of nature's complexity and our social  environmental  economic complexity. Today  we have young women like this one teaching villages in Africa how to put their animals together into larger herds  plan their grazing to mimic nature  and where we have them hold their animals overnight    we run them in a predator friendly manner  because we have a lot of lands  and so on    and where they do this and hold them overnight to prepare the crop fields  we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well. Let's look at some results. This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe. It has just come through four months of very good rains it got that year  and it's going into the long dry season. But as you can see  all of that rain  almost of all it  has evaporated from the soil surface. Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended  and we have         people on almost permanent food aid. Now let's go to our land nearby on the same day  with the same rainfall  and look at that. Our river is flowing and healthy and clean. It's fine. The production of grass  shrubs  trees  wildlife  everything is now more productive  and we have virtually no fear of dry years. And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats     percent  planning the grazing to mimic nature and integrate them with all the elephants  buffalo  giraffe and other animals that we have. But before we began  our land looked like that. This site was bare and eroding for over    years regardless of what rain we got. Okay  Watch the marked tree and see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature. This was another site where it had been bare and eroding  and at the base of the marked small tree  we had lost over    centimeters of soil. Okay  And again  watch the change just using livestock to mimic nature. And there are fallen trees in there now  because the better land is now attracting elephants  etc. This land in Mexico was in terrible condition  and I've had to mark the hill because the change is so profound. I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the     s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland  and thankfully  now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future. And look at the amazing change in this one  where that gully has completely healed using nothing but livestock mimicking nature  and once more  we have the third generation of that family on that land with their flag still flying. The vast grasslands of Patagonia are turning to desert as you see here. The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher  and he has documented the steady decline of that land over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers. They put        sheep in one flock  really mimicking nature now with planned grazing  and they have documented a    percent increase in the production of the land in the first year. We now have in the violent Horn of Africa pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature and openly saying it is the only hope they have of saving their families and saving their culture. Ninety five percent of that land can only feed people from animals. I remind you that I am talking about most of the world's land here that controls our fate  including the most violent region of the world  where only animals can feed people from about    percent of the land. What we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as  I believe  fossil fuels  and maybe more than fossil fuels. But worse than that  it is causing hunger  poverty  violence  social breakdown and war  and as I am talking to you  millions of men  women and children are suffering and dying. And if this continues  we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing  even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels. I believe I've shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this. We are already doing so on about    million hectares on five continents  and people who understand far more about carbon than I do calculate that  for illustrative purposes  if we do what I am showing you here  we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grassland soils for thousands of years  and if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands that I've shown you  we can take us back to pre industrial levels  while feeding people. I can think of almost nothing that offers more hope for our planet  for your children  and their children  and all of humanity. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you  Chris. Chris Anderson  Thank you. I have  and I'm sure everyone here has  A  a hundred questions  B  wants to hug you. I'm just going to ask you one quick question. When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals  it's desert. What do they eat  How does that part work  How do you start  Allan Savory  Well  we have done this for a long time  and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is during mine reclamation  where it's     percent bare. But many years ago  we took the worst land in Zimbabwe  where I offered a    note in a hundred mile drive if somebody could find one grass in a hundred mile drive  and on that  we trebled the stocking rate  the number of animals  in the first year with no feeding  just by the movement  mimicking nature  and using a sigmoid curve  that principle. It's a little bit technical to explain here  but just that. CA  Well  I would love to    I mean  this such an interesting and important idea. The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and    I want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.AS  Wonderful. CA  That is an astonishing talk  truly an astonishing talk  and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way. Thank you so much.AS  Well  thank you. Thank you. Thank you  Chris. The Kraken  a beast so terrifying it was said to devour men and ships and whales  and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island. In assessing the merits of such tales  it's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins   Once upon a time   and a sea story begins   This ain't no shit.   Laughter  Every fish that gets away grows with every telling of the tale. Nevertheless  there are giants in the ocean  and we now have video proof  as those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware. I was one of the three scientists on this expedition that took place last summer off Japan. I'm the short one. The other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O'Shea. I owe my participation in this now historic event to TED. In       there was a TED event called Mission Blue held aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos as part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle's TED wish. I spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean  one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away. Mike deGruy was also invited  and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean  and he also talked to me about applying my approach to something he's been involved with for a very long time  which is the hunt for the giant squid. It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit  a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel that summer during Shark Week.  Laughter  I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing and optical luring of deep sea squid in which I emphasized the importance of using quiet  unobtrusive platforms for exploration. This came out of hundreds of dives I have made  farting around in the dark using these platforms  and my impression that I saw more animals working from the submersible than I did with either of the remote operated vehicles. But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view. But I also felt like I saw more animals working with the Tiburon than the Ventana  two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems. So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make. So I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean  and I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance and recorded the sound they made. The Johnson Sea Link     whirring noise     which you can probably just barely hear here  uses electric thrusters    very  very quiet. The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters. It's also pretty quiet  but a bit noisier.  Louder whirring noise  But most deep diving ROVs these days use hydraulics and they sound like the Ventana.  Loud beeping noise  I think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away. So for the deep sea squid hunt  I proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters  no motors  just a battery powered camera  and the only illumination coming from red light that's invisible to most deep sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue. That's visible to our eye  but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea. So this camera platform  which we called the Medusa  could just be thrown off the back of the ship  attached to a float at the surface with over       feet of line  it would just float around passively carried by the currents  and the only light visible to the animals in the deep would be the blue light of the optical lure  which we called the electronic jellyfish  or e jelly  because it was designed to imitate the bioluminescent display of the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla. Now  this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense. The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish  but it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it's being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape. It's a scream for help  a last ditch attempt for escape  and a common form of defense in the deep sea. The approach worked. Whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner a single video glimpse of the giant  we managed six  and the first triggered wild excitement. Edith Widder  on video   Oh my God. Oh my God  Are you kidding me Other scientists  Oh ho ho  That's just hanging there. EW  It was like it was teasing us  doing a kind of fan dance    now you see me  now you don't    and we had four such teasing appearances  and then on the fifth  it came in and totally wowed us. Scientists  Ooh. Bang  Oh my God  Whoa  EW  The full monty. What really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it  which I think it mistook for the predator on the e jelly. But even more incredible was the footage shot from the Triton submersible. What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used  a one meter long diamondback squid had a light attached to it  a squid jig of the type that longline fishermen use  and I think it was this light that brought the giant in. Now  what you're seeing is the intensified camera's view under red light  and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here. And then he got so excited  he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better  and the giant didn't run away  so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible  bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high resolution video. It was absolutely breathtaking  and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact and fully extended  it would have been as tall as a two story house. How could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now  We've only explored about five percent of our ocean. There are great discoveries yet to be made down there  fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine. Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction of the money on ocean exploration that we've spent on space exploration. We need a NASA like organization for ocean exploration  because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on Earth. We need   thank you.  Applause  Exploration is the engine that drives innovation. Innovation drives economic growth. So let's all go exploring  but let's do it in a way that doesn't scare the animals away  or  as Mike deGruy once said   If you want to get away from it all and see something you've never seen  or have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one's ever seen  get in a sub.  He should have been with us for this adventure. We miss him. I live in South Central. This is South Central  liquor stores  fast food  vacant lots. So the city planners  they get together and they figure they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else  so they change it to South Los Angeles  like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city. This is South Los Angeles.  Laughter  Liquor stores  fast food  vacant lots. Just like   .  million other Americans  I live in a food desert  South Central Los Angeles  home of the drive thru and the drive by. Funny thing is  the drive thrus are killing more people than the drive bys. People are dying from curable diseases in South Central Los Angeles. For instance  the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than  say  Beverly Hills  which is probably eight     miles away. I got tired of seeing this happening. And I was wondering  how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food  if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood  I see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars. I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks. And I figured  this has to stop. So I figured that the problem is the solution. Food is the problem and food is the solution. Plus I got tired of driving    minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides. So what I did  I planted a food forest in front of my house. It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway. It's     feet by    feet. Thing is  it's owned by the city. But you have to maintain it. So I'm like   Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want  since it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it.  And this is how I decided to maintain it. So me and my group  L.A. Green Grounds  we got together and we started planting my food forest  fruit trees  you know  the whole nine  vegetables. What we do  we're a pay it forward kind of group  where it's composed of gardeners from all walks of life  from all over the city  and it's completely volunteer  and everything we do is free. And the garden  it was beautiful. And then somebody complained. The city came down on me  and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden  which this citation was turning into a warrant. And I'm like   Come on  really  A warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about    Laughter  And I was like   Cool. Bring it.  Because this time it wasn't coming up. So L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman  and one of the Green Grounds members  they put up a petition on Change.org  and with     signatures  we were a success. We had a victory on our hands. My councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we're doing. I mean  come on  why wouldn't they  L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns. They own    square miles of vacant lots. That's    Central Parks. That's enough space to plant     million tomato plants. Why in the hell would they not okay this  Growing one plant will give you               seeds. When one dollar's worth of green beans will give you    dollars' worth of produce. It's my gospel  when I'm telling people  grow your own food. Growing your own food is like printing your own money. See  I have a legacy in South Central. I grew up there. I raised my sons there. And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people  and I'm manufacturing my own reality. See  I'm an artist. Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art. Just like a graffiti artist  where they beautify walls  me  I beautify lawns  parkways. I use the garden  the soil  like it's a piece of cloth  and the plants and the trees  that's my embellishment for that cloth. You'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas. You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people. So what happened  I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education  a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood. To change the community  you have to change the composition of the soil. We are the soil. You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this. Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do  especially in the inner city. Plus you get strawberries. I remember this time  there was this mother and a daughter came  it was  like        at night  and they were in my yard  and I came out and they looked so ashamed. So I'm like  man  it made me feel bad that they were there  and I told them  you know  you don't have to do this like this. This is on the street for a reason. It made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry  and this only reinforced why I do this  and people asked me   Fin  aren't you afraid people are going to steal your food   And I'm like   Hell no  I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it. That's why it's on the street. That's the whole idea. I want them to take it  but at the same time  I want them to take back their health.  There's another time when I put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles. These are the guys  they helped me unload the truck. It was cool  and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother  and it was just cool to see how this changed them  if it was only for that one moment. So Green Grounds has gone on to plant maybe    gardens. We've had  like     people come to our dig ins and participate  and it's all volunteers. If kids grow kale  kids eat kale. If they grow tomatoes  they eat tomatoes.  Applause  But when none of this is presented to them  if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body  they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them. I see young people and they want to work  but they're in this thing where they're caught up    I see kids of color and they're just on this track that's designed for them  that leads them to nowhere. So with gardening  I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities  to have a sustainable life. And when we do this  who knows  We might produce the next George Washington Carver. but if we don't change the composition of the soil  we will never do this. Now this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do. I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block. I want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes. Now don't get me wrong. I'm not talking about no free shit  because free is not sustainable. The funny thing about sustainability  you have to sustain it. What I'm talking about is putting people to work  and getting kids off the street  and letting them know the joy  the pride and the honor in growing your own food  opening farmer's markets. So what I want to do here  we gotta make this sexy. So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades  gangstas  gangsta gardeners. We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is. If you ain't a gardener  you ain't gangsta. Get gangsta with your shovel  okay  And let that be your weapon of choice. So basically  if you want to meet with me  you know  if you want to meet  don't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit    where you talk about doing some shit. If you want to meet with me  come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit. Peace. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  There's a group of people in Kenya. People cross oceans to go see them. These people are tall. They jump high. They wear red. And they kill lions. You might be wondering  who are these people  These are the Maasais. And you know what's cool  I'm actually one of them. The Maasais  the boys are brought up to be warriors. The girls are brought up to be mothers. When I was five years old  I found out that I was engaged to be married as soon as I reached puberty. My mother  my grandmother  my aunties  they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by. And everything I had to do from that moment was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age   . My day started at   in the morning  milking the cows  sweeping the house  cooking for my siblings  collecting water  firewood. I did everything that I needed to do to become a perfect wife. I went to school not because the Maasais' women or girls were going to school. It's because my mother was denied an education  and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living. Why did she say that  My father worked as a policeman in the city. He came home once a year. We didn't see him for sometimes even two years. And whenever he came home  it was a different case. My mother worked hard in the farm to grow crops so that we can eat. She reared the cows and the goats so that she can care for us. But when my father came  he would sell the cows  he would sell the products we had  and he went and drank with his friends in the bars. Because my mother was a woman  she was not allowed to own any property  and by default  everything in my family anyway belongs to my father  so he had the right. And if my mother ever questioned him  he beat her  abused her  and really it was difficult. When I went to school  I had a dream. I wanted to become a teacher. Teachers looked nice. They wear nice dresses  high heeled shoes. I found out later that they are uncomfortable  but I admired it. But most of all  the teacher was just writing on the board    not hard work  that's what I thought  compared to what I was doing in the farm. So I wanted to become a teacher. I worked hard in school  but when I was in eighth grade  it was a determining factor. In our tradition  there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become women  and it's a rite of passage to womanhood. And then I was just finishing my eighth grade  and that was a transition for me to go to high school. This was the crossroad. Once I go through this tradition  I was going to become a wife. Well  my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass. So I talked    I had to come up with a plan to figure these things out. I talked to my father. I did something that most girls have never done. I told my father   I will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school.  The reason why  if I ran away  my father will have a stigma  people will be calling him the father of that girl who didn't go through the ceremony. It was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life. So he figured out.  Well   he said   okay  you'll go to school after the ceremony.  I did. The ceremony happened. It's a whole week long of excitement. It's a ceremony. People are enjoying it. And the day before the actual ceremony happens  we were dancing  having excitement  and through all the night we did not sleep. The actual day came  and we walked out of the house that we were dancing in. Yes  we danced and danced. We walked out to the courtyard  and there were a bunch of people waiting. They were all in a circle. And as we danced and danced  and we approached this circle of women  men  women  children  everybody was there. There was a woman sitting in the middle of it  and this woman was waiting to hold us. I was the first. There were my sisters and a couple of other girls  and as I approached her  she looked at me  and I sat down. And I sat down  and I opened my legs. As I opened my leg  another woman came  and this woman was carrying a knife. And as she carried the knife  she walked toward me and she held the clitoris  and she cut it off. As you can imagine  I bled. I bled. After bleeding for a while  I fainted thereafter. It's something that so many girls    I'm lucky  I never died    but many die. It's practiced  it's no anesthesia  it's a rusty old knife  and it was difficult. I was lucky because one  also  my mom did something that most women don't do. Three days later  after everybody has left the home  my mom went and brought a nurse. We were taken care of. Three weeks later  I was healed  and I was back in high school. I was so determined to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family. Well  while I was in high school  something happened. I met a young gentleman from our village who had been to the University of Oregon. This man was wearing a white t shirt  jeans  camera  white sneakers    and I'm talking about white sneakers. There is something about clothes  I think  and shoes. They were sneakers  and this is in a village that doesn't even have paved roads. It was quite attractive. I told him   Well  I want to go to where you are   because this man looked very happy  and I admired that. And he told me   Well  what do you mean  you want to go  Don't you have a husband waiting for you   And I told him   Don't worry about that part. Just tell me how to get there.  This gentleman  he helped me. While I was in high school also  my dad was sick. He got a stroke  and he was really  really sick  so he really couldn't tell me what to do next. But the problem is  my father is not the only father I have. Everybody who is my dad's age  male in the community  is my father by default    my uncles  all of them    and they dictate what my future is. So the news came  I applied to school and I was accepted to Randolph Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg  Virginia  and I couldn't come without the support of the village  because I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket. I got a scholarship but I needed to get myself here. But I needed the support of the village  and here again  when the men heard  and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school  they said   What a lost opportunity. This should have been given to a boy. We can't do this.  So I went back and I had to go back to the tradition. There's a belief among our people that morning brings good news. So I had to come up with something to do with the morning  because there's good news in the morning. And in the village also  there is one chief  an elder  who if he says yes  everybody will follow him. So I went to him very early in the morning  as the sun rose. The first thing he sees when he opens his door is  it's me.  My child  what are you doing here    Well  Dad  I need help. Can you support me to go to America   I promised him that I would be the best girl  I will come back  anything they wanted after that  I will do it for them. He said   Well  but I can't do it alone.  He gave me a list of another    men that I went       more men    every single morning I went and visited them. They all came together. The village  the women  the men  everybody came together to support me to come to get an education. I arrived in America. As you can imagine  what did I find  I found snow  I found Wal Marts  vacuum cleaners  and lots of food in the cafeteria. I was in a land of plenty. I enjoyed myself  but during that moment while I was here  I discovered a lot of things. I learned that that ceremony that I went through when I was    years old  it was called female genital mutilation. I learned that it was against the law in Kenya. I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body to get an education. I had a right. And as we speak right now  three million girls in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation. I learned that my mom had a right to own property. I learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman. Those things made me angry. I wanted to do something. As I went back  every time I went  I found that my neighbors' girls were getting married. They were getting mutilated  and here  after I graduated from here  I worked at the U.N.  I went back to school to get my graduate work  the constant cry of these girls was in my face. I had to do something. As I went back  I started talking to the men  to the village  and mothers  and I said   I want to give back the way I had promised you that I would come back and help you. What do you need   As I spoke to the women  they told me   You know what we need  We really need a school for girls.  Because there had not been any school for girls. And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she's walking to school  the mother is blamed for that. If she got pregnant before she got married  the mother is blamed for that  and she's punished. She's beaten. They said   We wanted to put our girls in a safe place.  As we moved  and I went to talk to the fathers  the fathers  of course  you can imagine what they said   We want a school for boys.  And I said   Well  there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have gotten an education. Why can't they build a school for boys  and I'll build a school for girls   That made sense. And they agreed. And I told them  I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment. And they did. They donated land where we built the girls' school. We have. I want you to meet one of the girls in that school. Angeline came to apply for the school  and she did not meet any criteria that we had. She's an orphan. Yes  we could have taken her for that. But she was older. She was    years old  and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade. Angeline had been moving from one place    because she's an orphan  she has no mother  she has no father    moving from one grandmother's house to another one  from aunties to aunties. She had no stability in her life. And I looked at her  I remember that day  and I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline. And yes  she was older to be in fourth grade. We gave her the opportunity to come to the class. Five months later  that is Angeline. A transformation had begun in her life. Angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world and make a difference. She was not the top student when we took her. Now she's the best student  not just in our school  but in the entire division that we are in. That's Sharon. That's five years later. That's Evelyn. Five months later  that is the difference that we are making. As a new dawn is happening in my school  a new beginning is happening. As we speak right now      girls will never be mutilated. One hundred twenty five girls will not be married when they're    years old. One hundred twenty five girls are creating and achieving their dreams. This is the thing that we are doing  giving them opportunities where they can rise. As we speak right now  women are not being beaten because of the revolutions we've started in our community. I want to challenge you today. You are listening to me because you are here  very optimistic. You are somebody who is so passionate. You are somebody who wants to see a better world. You are somebody who wants to see that war ends  no poverty. You are somebody who wants to make a difference. You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better. I want to challenge you today that to be the first  because people will follow you. Be the first. People will follow you. Be bold. Stand up. Be fearless. Be confident. Move out  because as you change your world  as you change your community  as we believe that we are impacting one girl  one family  one village  one country at a time. We are making a difference  so if you change your world  you are going to change your community  you are going to change your country  and think about that. If you do that  and I do that  aren't we going to create a better future for our children  for your children  for our grandchildren  And we will live in a very peaceful world. Thank you very much. There's so many of you. When I was a kid  I hid my heart under the bed  because my mother said   If you're not careful  someday someone's going to break it.  Take it from me  Under the bed is not a good hiding spot. I know because I've been shot down so many times  I get altitude sickness just from standing up for myself. But that's what we were told.  Stand up for yourself.  And that's hard to do if you don't know who you are. We were expected to define ourselves at such an early age  and if we didn't do it  others did it for us. Geek. Fatty. Slut. Fag. And at the same time we were being told what we were  we were being asked   What do you want to be when you grow up   I always thought that was an unfair question. It presupposes that we can't be what we already are. We were kids. When I was a kid  I wanted to be a man. I wanted a registered retirement savings plan that would keep me in candy long enough to make old age sweet. When I was a kid  I wanted to shave. Now  not so much. When I was eight  I wanted to be a marine biologist. When I was nine  I saw the movie  Jaws   and thought to myself   No  thank you.  And when I was     I was told that my parents left because they didn't want me. When I was     I wanted to be left alone. When I was     I wanted to die. When I was     I wanted to kill a kid. When I was     I was asked to seriously consider a career path. I said   I'd like to be a writer.  And they said   Choose something realistic.  So I said   Professional wrestler.  And they said   Don't be stupid.  See  they asked me what I wanted to be  then told me what not to be. And I wasn't the only one. We were being told that we somehow must become what we are not  sacrificing what we are to inherit the masquerade of what we will be. I was being told to accept the identity that others will give me. And I wondered  what made my dreams so easy to dismiss  Granted  my dreams are shy  because they're Canadian. My dreams are self conscious and overly apologetic. They're standing alone at the high school dance  and they've never been kissed. See  my dreams got called names too. Silly. Foolish. Impossible. But I kept dreaming. I was going to be a wrestler. I had it all figured out. I was going to be The Garbage Man. My finishing move was going to be The Trash Compactor. My saying was going to be   I'm taking out the trash   And then this guy  Duke  The Dumpster  Droese  stole my entire shtick. I was crushed  as if by a trash compactor. I thought to myself   What now  Where do I turn   Poetry. Like a boomerang  the thing I loved came back to me. One of the first lines of poetry I can remember writing was in response to a world that demanded I hate myself. From age    to     I hated myself for becoming the thing that I loathed  a bully. When I was     I wrote   I will love myself despite the ease with which I lean toward the opposite.  Standing up for yourself doesn't have to mean embracing violence. When I was a kid  I traded in homework assignments for friendship  then gave each friend a late slip for never showing up on time  and in most cases  not at all. I gave myself a hall pass to get through each broken promise. And I remember this plan  born out of frustration from a kid who kept calling me  Yogi   then pointed at my tummy and said   Too many picnic baskets.  Turns out it's not that hard to trick someone  and one day before class  I said   Yeah  you can copy my homework   and I gave him all the wrong answers that I'd written down the night before. He got his paper back expecting a near perfect score  and couldn't believe it when he looked across the room at me and held up a zero. I knew I didn't have to hold up my paper of    out of     but my satisfaction was complete when he looked at me  puzzled  and I thought to myself   Smarter than the average bear  motherfucker.  This is who I am. This is how I stand up for myself. When I was a kid  I used to think that pork chops and karate chops were the same thing. I thought they were both pork chops. My grandmother thought it was cute  and because they were my favorite  she let me keep doing it. Not really a big deal. One day  before I realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees  I fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body. I didn't want to tell my grandmother because I was scared I'd get in trouble for playing somewhere I shouldn't have been. The gym teacher noticed the bruise  and I got sent to the principal's office. From there  I was sent to another small room with a really nice lady who asked me all kinds of questions about my life at home. I saw no reason to lie. As far as I was concerned  life was pretty good. I told her  whenever I'm sad  my grandmother gives me karate chops. This led to a full scale investigation  and I was removed from the house for three days  until they finally decided to ask how I got the bruises. News of this silly little story quickly spread through the school  and I earned my first nickname  Porkchop. To this day  I hate pork chops. I'm not the only kid who grew up this way  surrounded by people who used to say that rhyme about sticks and stones  as if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called  and we got called them all. So we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us  that we'd be lonely forever  that we'd never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their toolshed. So broken heartstrings bled the blues  and we tried to empty ourselves so we'd feel nothing. Don't tell me that hurts less than a broken bone  that an ingrown life is something surgeons can cut away  that there's no way for it to metastasize  it does. She was eight years old  our first day of grade three when she got called ugly. We both got moved to the back of class so we would stop getting bombarded by spitballs. But the school halls were a battleground. We found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day. We used to stay inside for recess  because outside was worse. Outside  we'd have to rehearse running away  or learn to stay still like statues  giving no clues that we were there. In grade five  they taped a sign to the front of her desk that read   Beware of dog.  To this day  despite a loving husband  she doesn't think she's beautiful  because of a birthmark that takes up a little less than half her face. Kids used to say   She looks like a wrong answer that someone tried to erase  but couldn't quite get the job done.  And they'll never understand that she's raising two kids whose definition of beauty begins with the word  Mom   because they see her heart before they see her skin  because she's only ever always been amazing. He was a broken branch grafted onto a different family tree  adopted  not because his parents opted for a different destiny. He was three when he became a mixed drink of one part left alone and two parts tragedy  started therapy in eighth grade  had a personality made up of tests and pills  lived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs  four fifths suicidal  a tidal wave of antidepressants  and an adolescent being called  Popper   one part because of the pills     parts because of the cruelty. He tried to kill himself in grade    when a kid who could still go home to Mom and Dad had the audacity to tell him   Get over it.  As if depression is something that could be remedied by any of the contents found in a first aid kit. To this day  he is a stick of TNT lit from both ends  could describe to you in detail the way the sky bends in the moment before it's about to fall  and despite an army of friends who all call him an inspiration  he remains a conversation piece between people who can't understand sometimes being drug free has less to do with addiction and more to do with sanity. We weren't the only kids who grew up this way. To this day  kids are still being called names. The classics were  Hey  stupid    Hey  spaz.  Seems like every school has an arsenal of names getting updated every year. And if a kid breaks in a school and no one around chooses to hear  do they make a sound  Are they just background noise from a soundtrack stuck on repeat  when people say things like   Kids can be cruel.  Every school was a big top circus tent  and the pecking order went from acrobats to lion tamers  from clowns to carnies  all of these miles ahead of who we were. We were freaks    lobster claw boys and bearded ladies  oddities juggling depression and loneliness  playing solitaire  spin the bottle  trying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal  but at night  while the others slept  we kept walking the tightrope. It was practice  and yes  some of us fell. But I want to tell them that all of this is just debris left over when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought we used to be  and if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself  get a better mirror  look a little closer  stare a little longer  because there's something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit. You built a cast around your broken heart and signed it yourself   They were wrong.  Because maybe you didn't belong to a group or a clique. Maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything. Maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show and tell  but never told  because how can you hold your ground if everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it  You have to believe that they were wrong. They have to be wrong. Why else would we still be here  We grew up learning to cheer on the underdog because we see ourselves in them. We stem from a root planted in the belief that we are not what we were called. We are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting empty on some highway  and if in some way we are  don't worry. We only got out to walk and get gas. We are graduating members from the class of We Made It  not the faded echoes of voices crying out   Names will never hurt me.  Of course they did. But our lives will only ever always continue to be a balancing act that has less to do with pain and more to do with beauty. I want to talk about social innovation and social entrepreneurship. I happen to have triplets. They're little. They're five years old. Sometimes I tell people I have triplets. They say   Really  How many   Here's a picture of the kids    that's Sage  and Annalisa and Rider. Now  I also happen to be gay. Being gay and fathering triplets is by far the most socially innovative  socially entrepreneurial thing I have ever done. The real social innovation I want to talk about involves charity. I want to talk about how the things we've been taught to think about giving and about charity and about the nonprofit sector  are actually undermining the causes we love  and our profound yearning to change the world. But before I do that  I want to ask if we even believe that the nonprofit sector has any serious role to play in changing the world. A lot of people say now that business will lift up the developing economies  and social business will take care of the rest. And I do believe that business will move the great mass of humanity forward. But it always leaves behind that    percent or more that is most disadvantaged or unlucky. And social business needs markets  and there are some issues for which you just can't develop the kind of money measures that you need for a market. I sit on the board of a center for the developmentally disabled  and these people want laughter and compassion and they want love. How do you monetize that  And that's where the nonprofit sector and philanthropy come in. Philanthropy is the market for love. It is the market for all those people for whom there is no other market coming. And so if we really want  like Buckminster Fuller said  a world that works for everyone  with no one and nothing left out  then the nonprofit sector has to be a serious part of the conversation. But it doesn't seem to be working. Why have our breast cancer charities not come close to finding a cure for breast cancer  or our homeless charities not come close to ending homelessness in any major city  Why has poverty remained stuck at    percent of the U.S. population for    years  And the answer is  these social problems are massive in scale  our organizations are tiny up against them  and we have a belief system that keeps them tiny. We have two rulebooks. We have one for the nonprofit sector  and one for the rest of the economic world. It's an apartheid  and it discriminates against the nonprofit sector in five different areas  the first being compensation. So in the for profit sector  the more value you produce  the more money you can make. But we don't like nonprofits to use money to incentivize people to produce more in social service. We have a visceral reaction to the idea that anyone would make very much money helping other people. Interestingly  we don't have a visceral reaction to the notion that people would make a lot of money not helping other people. You know  you want to make    million dollars selling violent video games to kids  go for it. We'll put you on the cover of Wired magazine. But you want to make half a million dollars trying to cure kids of malaria  and you're considered a parasite yourself. And we think of this as our system of ethics  but what we don't realize is that this system has a powerful side effect  which is  It gives a really stark  mutually exclusive choice between doing very well for yourself and your family or doing good for the world  to the brightest minds coming out of our best universities  and sends tens of thousands of people who could make a huge difference in the nonprofit sector  marching every year directly into the for profit sector because they're not willing to make that kind of lifelong economic sacrifice. Businessweek did a survey  looked at the compensation packages for MBAs    years out of business school. And the median compensation for a Stanford MBA  with bonus  at the age of     was         dollars. Meanwhile  for the same year  the average salary for the CEO of a    million plus medical charity in the U.S. was         dollars  and for a hunger charity         dollars. Now  there's no way you're going to get a lot of people with          talent to make a          sacrifice every year to become the CEO of a hunger charity. Some people say   Well  that's just because those MBA types are greedy.  Not necessarily. They might be smart. It's cheaper for that person to donate         dollars every year to the hunger charity  save        dollars on their taxes    so still be roughly         dollars a year ahead of the game    now be called a philanthropist because they donated         dollars to charity  probably sit on the board of the hunger charity  indeed  probably supervise the poor SOB who decided to become the CEO of the hunger charity  and have a lifetime of this kind of power and influence and popular praise still ahead of them. The second area of discrimination is advertising and marketing. So we tell the for profit sector   Spend  spend  spend on advertising  until the last dollar no longer produces a penny of value.  But we don't like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity. Our attitude is   Well  look  if you can get the advertising donated  you know  to air at four o'clock in the morning  I'm okay with that. But I don't want my donation spent on advertising  I want it go to the needy.  As if the money invested in advertising could not bring in dramatically greater sums of money to serve the needy. In the     s  my company created the long distance AIDSRide bicycle journeys  and the    mile long breast cancer three day walks  and over the course of nine years  we had         ordinary heroes participate  and they raised a total of     million dollars. They raised more money more quickly for these causes than any events in history  all based on the idea that people are weary of being asked to do the least they can possibly do. People are yearning to measure the full distance of their potential on behalf of the causes that they care about deeply. But they have to be asked. We got that many people to participate by buying full page ads in The New York Times  in The Boston Globe  in prime time radio and TV advertising. Do you know how many people we would've gotten if we put up fliers in the laundromat  Charitable giving has remained stuck in the U.S.  at two percent of GDP  ever since we started measuring it in the     s. That's an important fact  because it tells us that in    years  the nonprofit sector has not been able to wrestle any market share away from the for profit sector. And if you think about it  how could one sector possibly take market share away from another sector if it isn't really allowed to market  And if we tell the consumer brands   You may advertise all the benefits of your product   but we tell charities   You cannot advertise all the good that you do   where do we think the consumer dollars are going to flow  The third area of discrimination is the taking of risk in pursuit of new ideas for generating revenue. So Disney can make a new      million movie that flops  and nobody calls the attorney general. But you do a little    million community fundraiser for the poor  and it doesn't produce a    percent profit to the cause in the first    months  and your character is called into question. So nonprofits are really reluctant to attempt any brave  daring  giant scale new fundraising endeavors  for fear that if the thing fails  their reputations will be dragged through the mud. Well  you and I know when you prohibit failure  you kill innovation. If you kill innovation in fundraising  you can't raise more revenue  if you can't raise more revenue  you can't grow  and if you can't grow  you can't possibly solve large social problems. The fourth area is time. So Amazon went for six years without returning any profit to investors  and people had patience. They knew that there was a long term objective down the line  of building market dominance. But if a nonprofit organization ever had a dream of building magnificent scale that required that for six years  no money was going to go to the needy  it was all going to be invested in building this scale  we would expect a crucifixion. The last area is profit itself. So the for profit sector can pay people profits in order to attract their capital for their new ideas  but you can't pay profits in a nonprofit sector  so the for profit sector has a lock on the multi trillion dollar capital markets  and the nonprofit sector is starved for growth and risk and idea capital. Well  you put those five things together    you can't use money to lure talent away from the for profit sector  you can't advertise on anywhere near the scale the for profit sector does for new customers  you can't take the kinds of risks in pursuit of those customers that the for profit sector takes  you don't have the same amount of time to find them as the for profit sector  and you don't have a stock market with which to fund any of this  even if you could do it in the first place    and you've just put the nonprofit sector at an extreme disadvantage to the for profit sector  on every level. If we have any doubts about the effects of this separate rule book  this statistic is sobering  From      to       the number of nonprofits that really grew  that crossed the     million annual revenue barrier  is    . In the same time  the number of for profits that crossed it is       . So we're dealing with social problems that are massive in scale  and our organizations can't generate any scale. All of the scale goes to Coca Cola and Burger King. So why do we think this way  Well  like most fanatical dogma in America  these ideas come from old Puritan beliefs. The Puritans came here for religious reasons  or so they said  but they also came here because they wanted to make a lot of money. They were pious people  but they were also really aggressive capitalists  and they were accused of extreme forms of profit making tendencies  compared to the other colonists. But at the same time  the Puritans were Calvinists  so they were taught literally to hate themselves. They were taught that self interest was a raging sea that was a sure path to eternal damnation. This created a real problem for these people. Here they've come all the way across the Atlantic to make all this money  but making all this money will get you sent directly to Hell. What were they to do about this  Well  charity became their answer. It became this economic sanctuary  where they could do penance for their profit making tendencies    at five cents on the dollar. So of course  how could you make money in charity if charity was your penance for making money  Financial incentive was exiled from the realm of helping others  so that it could thrive in the area of making money for yourself  and in     years  nothing has intervened to say   That's counterproductive and that's unfair.  Now  this ideology gets policed by this one very dangerous question  which is   What percentage of my donation goes to the cause versus overhead   There are a lot of problems with this question. I'm going to just focus on two. First  it makes us think that overhead is a negative  that it is somehow not part of the cause. But it absolutely is  especially if it's being used for growth. Now  this idea that overhead is somehow an enemy of the cause creates this second  much larger problem  which is  it forces organizations to go without the overhead things they really need to grow  in the interest of keeping overhead low. So we've all been taught that charities should spend as little as possible on overhead things like fundraising under the theory that  well  the less money you spend on fundraising  the more money there is available for the cause. Well  that's true if it's a depressing world in which this pie cannot be made any bigger. But if it's a logical world in which investment in fundraising actually raises more funds and makes the pie bigger  then we have it precisely backwards  and we should be investing more money  not less  in fundraising  because fundraising is the one thing that has the potential to multiply the amount of money available for the cause that we care about so deeply. I'll give you two examples. We launched the AIDSRides with an initial investment of        dollars in risk capital. Within nine years  we had multiplied that       times  into     million dollars after all expenses  for AIDS services. We launched the breast cancer three days with an initial investment of         dollars in risk capital. Within just five years  we had multiplied that     times  into     million dollars after all expenses  for breast cancer research. Now  if you were a philanthropist really interested in breast cancer  what would make more sense  go out and find the most innovative researcher in the world and give her         dollars for research  or give her fundraising department the         dollars to multiply it into     million dollars for breast cancer research       was our most successful year ever. We netted for breast cancer alone  that year alone     million dollars after all expenses. And then we went out of business  suddenly and traumatically. Why  Well  the short story is  our sponsors split on us. They wanted to distance themselves from us because we were being crucified in the media for investing    percent of the gross in recruitment and customer service and the magic of the experience  and there is no accounting terminology to describe that kind of investment in growth and in the future  other than this demonic label of  overhead.  So on one day  all     of our great employees lost their jobs ... because they were labeled  overhead.  Our sponsor went and tried the events on their own. The overhead went up. Net income for breast cancer research went down by    percent  or    million dollars  in one year. This is what happens when we confuse morality with frugality. We've all been taught that the bake sale with five percent overhead is morally superior to the professional fundraising enterprise with    percent overhead  but we're missing the most important piece of information  which is  What is the actual size of these pies  Who cares if the bake sale only has five percent overhead if it's tiny  What if the bake sale only netted    dollars for charity because it made no investment in its scale and the professional fundraising enterprise netted    million dollars because it did  Now which pie would we prefer  and which pie do we think people who are hungry would prefer  Here's how all of this impacts the big picture. I said that charitable giving is two percent of GDP in the United States. That's about     billion dollars a year. But only about    percent of that  or    billion dollars  goes to health and human services causes. The rest goes to religion and higher education and hospitals  and that    billion dollars is not nearly enough to tackle these problems. But if we could move charitable giving from two percent of GDP  up just one step to three percent of GDP  by investing in that growth  that would be an extra     billion dollars a year in contributions  and if that money could go disproportionately to health and human services charities  because those were the ones we encouraged to invest in their growth  that would represent a tripling of contributions to that sector. Now we're talking scale. Now we're talking the potential for real change. But it's never going to happen by forcing these organizations to lower their horizons to the demoralizing objective of keeping their overhead low. Our generation does not want its epitaph to read   We kept charity overhead low.  We want it to read that we changed the world  and that part of the way we did that was by changing the way we think about these things. So the next time you're looking at a charity  don't ask about the rate of their overhead. Ask about the scale of their dreams  their Apple   Google   Amazon scale dreams  how they measure their progress toward those dreams  and what resources they need to make them come true  regardless of what the overhead is. Who cares what the overhead is if these problems are actually getting solved  If we can have that kind of generosity    a generosity of thought    then the non profit sector can play a massive role in changing the world for all those citizens most desperately in need of it to change. And if that can be our generation's enduring legacy    that we took responsibility for the thinking that had been handed down to us  that we revisited it  we revised it  and we reinvented the whole way humanity thinks about changing things  forever  for everyone    well  I thought I would let the kids sum up what that would be. Annalisa Smith Pallotta  That would be Sage Smith Pallotta  a real social Rider Smith Pallotta  innovation. Dan Pallotta  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. So raise your hand if you know someone in your immediate family or circle of friends who suffers from some form of mental illness. Yeah. I thought so. Not surprised. And raise your hand if you think that basic research on fruit flies has anything to do with understanding mental illness in humans. Yeah. I thought so. I'm also not surprised. I can see I've got my work cut out for me here. As we heard from Dr. Insel this morning  psychiatric disorders like autism  depression and schizophrenia take a terrible toll on human suffering. We know much less about their treatment and the understanding of their basic mechanisms than we do about diseases of the body. Think about it  In       the second decade of the millennium  if you're concerned about a cancer diagnosis and you go to your doctor  you get bone scans  biopsies and blood tests. In       if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis  you go to your doctor  and what do you get  A questionnaire. Now  part of the reason for this is that we have an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders. We tend to view them    and the popular press aids and abets this view    as chemical imbalances in the brain  as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup full of dopamine  serotonin and norepinephrine. This view is conditioned by the fact that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders  like Prozac  act by globally changing brain chemistry  as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup. But that can't be the answer  because these drugs actually don't work all that well. A lot of people won't take them  or stop taking them  because of their unpleasant side effects. These drugs have so many side effects because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder is a bit like trying to change your engine oil by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block. Some of it will dribble into the right place  but a lot of it will do more harm than good. Now  an emerging view that you also heard about from Dr. Insel this morning  is that psychiatric disorders are actually disturbances of neural circuits that mediate emotion  mood and affect. When we think about cognition  we analogize the brain to a computer. That's no problem. Well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion. It's just that we don't tend to think about it that way. But we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatric disorders because of the overwhelming dominance of this chemical imbalance hypothesis. Now  it's not that chemicals are not important in psychiatric disorders. It's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup. Rather  they're released in very specific locations and they act on specific synapses to change the flow of information in the brain. So if we ever really want to understand the biological basis of psychiatric disorders  we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain where these chemicals act. Otherwise  we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences. Now to begin to overcome our ignorance of the role of brain chemistry in brain circuitry  it's helpful to work on what we biologists call  model organisms   animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice  in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to molecularly identify and pinpoint specific classes of neurons  as you heard about in Allan Jones's talk this morning. Moreover  once we can do that  we can actually activate specific neurons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons. So if we inhibit a particular type of neuron  and we find that a behavior is blocked  we can conclude that those neurons are necessary for that behavior. On the other hand  if we activate a group of neurons and we find that that produces the behavior  we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior. So in this way  by doing this kind of test  we can draw cause and effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particular behaviors  something that is extremely difficult  if not impossible  to do right now in humans. But can an organism like a fruit fly  which is    it's a great model organism because it's got a small brain  it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors  it breeds quickly  and it's cheap. But can an organism like this teach us anything about emotion like states  Do these organisms even have emotion like states  or are they just little digital robots  Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behaviors  as he wrote in his      monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals. And my eponymous colleague  Seymour Benzer  believed it as well. Seymour is the man that introduced the use of drosophila here at CalTech in the '  s as a model organism to study the connection between genes and behavior. Seymour recruited me to CalTech in the late     s. He was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here  and Seymour taught me both to love flies and also to play with science. So how do we ask this question  It's one thing to believe that flies have emotion like states  but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not  Now  in humans we often infer emotional states  as you'll hear later today  from facial expressions. However  it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies. It's kind of like landing on Mars and looking out the window of your spaceship at all the little green men who are surrounding it and trying to figure out   How do I find out if they have emotions or not   What can we do  It's not so easy. Well  one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion like states such as arousal  and see if we can identify any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties. So three important ones that I can think of are persistence  gradations in intensity  and valence. Persistence means long lasting. We all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone. Gradations of intensity means what it sounds like. You can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of an emotion. If you're a little bit unhappy  the corners of your mouth turn down and you sniffle  and if you're very unhappy  tears pour down your face and you might sob. Valence means good or bad  positive or negative. So we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table  you know  the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger the more vigorously you try to swat it away  and it seems to keep getting irritated. So we built a device  which we call a puff o mat  in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench and blow them away. And what we found is that if we gave these flies in the puff o mat several puffs in a row  they became somewhat hyperactive and continued to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped and took a while to calm down. So we quantified this behavior using custom locomotor tracking software developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona  who's in the electrical engineering division here at CalTech. And what this quantification showed us is that  upon experiencing a train of these air puffs  the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity which is persistent  long lasting  and also appears to be graded. More puffs  or more intense puffs  make the state last for a longer period of time. So now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state. So we decided to use our puff o mat and our automated tracking software to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs. And this is one of the great things about fruit flies. There are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation. So doing the screen  we discovered one mutant that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs  and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation  it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor. That's right    flies  like people  have dopamine  and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and I have. Dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain  including in attention  arousal  reward  and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse  Parkinson's disease  and ADHD. Now  in genetics  it's a little counterintuitive. We tend to infer the normal function of something by what doesn't happen when we take it away  by the opposite of what we see when we take it away. So when we take away the dopamine receptor and the flies take longer to calm down  from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine is to cause the flies to calm down faster after the puff. And that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD  which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans. Indeed  if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies by feeding them cocaine after getting the appropriate DEA license   oh my God     Laughter    we find indeed that these cocaine fed flies calm down faster than normal flies do  and that's also reminiscent of ADHD  which is often treated with drugs like Ritalin that act similarly to cocaine. So slowly I began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder. Now  how far does this analogy go  As many of you know  individuals afflicted with ADHD also have learning disabilities. Is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies  Remarkably  the answer is yes. As Seymour showed back in the     s  flies  like songbirds  as you just heard  are capable of learning. You can train a fly to avoid an odor  shown here in blue  if you pair that odor with a shock. Then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose between a tube with the shock paired odor and another odor  it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock. Well  if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies  they don't learn. Their learning score is zero. They flunk out of CalTech. So that means that these flies have two abnormalities  or phenotypes  as we geneticists call them  that one finds in ADHD  hyperactivity and learning disability. Now what's the causal relationship  if anything  between these phenotypes  In ADHD  it's often assumed that the hyperactivity causes the learning disability. The kids can't sit still long enough to focus  so they don't learn. But it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities that cause the hyperactivity. Because the kids can't learn  they look for other things to distract their attention. And a final possibility is that there's no relationship at all between learning disabilities and hyperactivity  but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD. Now people have been wondering about this for a long time in humans  but in flies we can actually test this. And the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics. We take our dopamine receptor mutant flies and we genetically restore  or cure  the dopamine receptor by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene back into the fly brain. But in each fly  we put it back only into certain neurons and not in others  and then we test each of these flies for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity. Remarkably  we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities. If we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back in this elliptical structure called the central complex  the flies are no longer hyperactive  but they still can't learn. On the other hand  if we put the receptor back in a different structure called the mushroom body  the learning deficit is rescued  the flies learn well  but they're still hyperactive. What that tells us is that dopamine is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup. Rather  it's acting to control two different functions on two different circuits  so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies is that the same receptor is controlling two different functions in two different regions of the brain. Whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans we don't know  but these kinds of results should at least cause us to consider that possibility. So these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup  and it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders just by changing the flavor of the soup. What we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge to try to design a new generation of treatments that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders. If we can do that  we may be able to cure these disorders without the unpleasant side effects  putting the oil back in our mental engines  just where it's needed. Thank you very much. Now  extinction is a different kind of death. It's bigger. We didn't really realize that until       when the last passenger pigeon  a female named Martha  died at the Cincinnati zoo. This had been the most abundant bird in the world that'd been in North America for six million years. Suddenly it wasn't here at all. Flocks that were a mile wide and     miles long used to darken the sun. Aldo Leopold said this was a biological storm  a feathered tempest. And indeed it was a keystone species that enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest  from the Mississippi to the Atlantic  from Canada down to the Gulf. But it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades. What happened  Well  commercial hunting happened. These birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton  and it was easy to do because when those big flocks came down to the ground  they were so dense that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up and slaughter them by the tens of thousands. It was the cheapest source of protein in America. By the end of the century  there was nothing left but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers. There's an upside to the story. This made people realize that the same thing was about to happen to the American bison  and so these birds saved the buffalos. But a lot of other animals weren't saved. The Carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere. It was hunted to death for its feathers. There was a bird that people liked on the East Coast called the heath hen. It was loved. They tried to protect it. It died anyway. A local newspaper spelled out   There is no survivor  there is no future  there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again.  There's a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things  and it happened to lots of birds that people loved. It happened to lots of mammals. Another keystone species is a famous animal called the European aurochs. There was sort of a movie made about it recently. And the aurochs was like the bison. This was an animal that basically kept the forest mixed with grasslands across the entire Europe and Asian continent  from Spain to Korea. The documentation of this animal goes back to the Lascaux cave paintings. The extinctions still go on. There's an ibex in Spain called the bucardo. It went extinct in     . There was a marvelous animal  a marsupial wolf called the thylacine in Tasmania  south of Australia  called the Tasmanian tiger. It was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos. A little bit of film was shot. Sorrow  anger  mourning. Don't mourn. Organize. What if you could find out that  using the DNA in museum specimens  fossils maybe up to         years old could be used to bring species back  what would you do  Where would you start  Well  you'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there. I started with my wife  Ryan Phelan  who ran a biotech business called DNA Direct  and through her  one of her colleagues  George Church  one of the leading genetic engineers who turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons and a lot of confidence that methodologies he was working on might actually do the deed. So he and Ryan organized and hosted a meeting at the Wyss Institute in Harvard bringing together specialists on passenger pigeons  conservation ornithologists  bioethicists  and fortunately passenger pigeon DNA had already been sequenced by a molecular biologist named Beth Shapiro. All she needed from those specimens at the Smithsonian was a little bit of toe pad tissue  because down in there is what is called ancient DNA. It's DNA which is pretty badly fragmented  but with good techniques now  you can basically reassemble the whole genome. Then the question is  can you reassemble  with that genome  the whole bird  George Church thinks you can. So in his book   Regenesis   which I recommend  he has a chapter on the science of bringing back extinct species  and he has a machine called the Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering machine. It's kind of like an evolution machine. You try combinations of genes that you write at the cell level and then in organs on a chip  and the ones that win  that you can then put into a living organism. It'll work. The precision of this  one of George's famous unreadable slides  nevertheless points out that there's a level of precision here right down to the individual base pair. The passenger pigeon has  .  billion base pairs in its genome. So what you're getting is the capability now of replacing one gene with another variation of that gene. It's called an allele. Well that's what happens in normal hybridization anyway. So this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome of an extinct species with the genome of its closest living relative. Now along the way  George points out that his technology  the technology of synthetic biology  is currently accelerating at four times the rate of Moore's Law. It's been doing that since       and it's likely to continue. Okay  the closest living relative of the passenger pigeon is the band tailed pigeon. They're abundant. There's some around here. Genetically  the band tailed pigeon already is mostly living passenger pigeon. There's just some bits that are band tailed pigeon. If you replace those bits with passenger pigeon bits  you've got the extinct bird back  cooing at you. Now  there's work to do. You have to figure out exactly what genes matter. So there's genes for the short tail in the band tailed pigeon  genes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon  and so on with the red eye  peach colored breast  flocking  and so on. Add them all up and the result won't be perfect. But it should be be perfect enough  because nature doesn't do perfect either. So this meeting in Boston led to three things. First off  Ryan and I decided to create a nonprofit called Revive and Restore that would push de extinction generally and try to have it go in a responsible way  and we would push ahead with the passenger pigeon. Another direct result was a young grad student named Ben Novak  who had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was    and had also learned how to work with ancient DNA  himself sequenced the passenger pigeon  using money from his family and friends. We hired him full time. Now  this photograph I took of him last year at the Smithsonian  he's looking down at Martha  the last passenger pigeon alive. So if he's successful  she won't be the last. The third result of the Boston meeting was the realization that there are scientists all over the world working on various forms of de extinction  but they'd never met each other. And National Geographic got interested because National Geographic has the theory that the last century  discovery was basically finding things  and in this century  discovery is basically making things. De extinction falls in that category. So they hosted and funded this meeting. And    scientists  they were conservation biologists and molecular biologists  basically meeting to see if they had work to do together. Some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical. There's three of them who are not just re creating ancient species  they're recreating extinct ecosystems in northern Siberia  in the Netherlands  and in Hawaii. Henri  from the Netherlands  with a Dutch last name I won't try to pronounce  is working on the aurochs. The aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle  and so basically its genome is alive  it's just unevenly distributed. So what they're doing is working with seven breeds of primitive  hardy looking cattle like that Maremmana primitivo on the top there to rebuild  over time  with selective back breeding  the aurochs. Now  re wilding is moving faster in Korea than it is in America  and so the plan is  with these re wilded areas all over Europe  they will introduce the aurochs to do its old job  its old ecological role  of clearing the somewhat barren  closed canopy forest so that it has these biodiverse meadows in it. Another amazing story came from Alberto Fern ndez Arias. Alberto worked with the bucardo in Spain. The last bucardo was a female named Celia who was still alive  but then they captured her  they got a little bit of tissue from her ear  they cryopreserved it in liquid nitrogen  released her back into the wild  but a few months later  she was found dead under a fallen tree. They took the DNA from that ear  they planted it as a cloned egg in a goat  the pregnancy came to term  and a live baby bucardo was born. It was the first de extinction in history. It was short lived. Sometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems. This one had a malformed lung and died after    minutes  but Alberto was confident that cloning has moved along well since then  and this will move ahead  and eventually there will be a population of bucardos back in the mountains in northern Spain. Cryopreservation pioneer of great depth is Oliver Ryder. At the San Diego zoo  his frozen zoo has collected the tissues from over       species over the last    years. Now  when it's frozen that deep  minus     degrees Celsius  the cells are intact and the DNA is intact. They're basically viable cells  so someone like Bob Lanza at Advanced Cell Technology took some of that tissue from an endangered animal called the Javan banteng  put it in a cow  the cow went to term  and what was born was a live  healthy baby Javan banteng  who thrived and is still alive. The most exciting thing for Bob Lanza is the ability now to take any kind of cell with induced pluripotent stem cells and turn it into germ cells  like sperm and eggs. So now we go to Mike McGrew who is a scientist at Roslin Institute in Scotland  and Mike's doing miracles with birds. So he'll take  say  falcon skin cells  fibroblast  turn it into induced pluripotent stem cells. Since it's so pluripotent  it can become germ plasm. He then has a way to put the germ plasm into the embryo of a chicken egg so that that chicken will have  basically  the gonads of a falcon. You get a male and a female each of those  and out of them comes falcons. Real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens. Ben Novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting. He showed how all of this can be put together. The sequence of events  he'll put together the genomes of the band tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon  he'll take the techniques of George Church and get passenger pigeon DNA  the techniques of Robert Lanza and Michael McGrew  get that DNA into chicken gonads  and out of the chicken gonads get passenger pigeon eggs  squabs  and now you're getting a population of passenger pigeons. It does raise the question of  they're not going to have passenger pigeon parents to teach them how to be a passenger pigeon. So what do you do about that  Well birds are pretty hard wired  as it happens  so most of that is already in their DNA  but to supplement it  part of Ben's idea is to use homing pigeons to help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock and how to find their way to their old nesting grounds and feeding grounds. There were some conservationists  really famous conservationists like Stanley Temple  who is one of the founders of conservation biology  and Kate Jones from the IUCN  which does the Red List. They're excited about all this  but they're also concerned that it might be competitive with the extremely important efforts to protect endangered species that are still alive  that haven't gone extinct yet. You see  you want to work on protecting the animals out there. You want to work on getting the market for ivory in Asia down so you're not using        elephants a year. But at the same time  conservation biologists are realizing that bad news bums people out. And so the Red List is really important  keep track of what's endangered and critically endangered  and so on. But they're about to create what they call a Green List  and the Green List will have species that are doing fine  thank you  species that were endangered  like the bald eagle  but they're much better off now  thanks to everybody's good work  and protected areas around the world that are very  very well managed. So basically  they're learning how to build on good news. And they see reviving extinct species as the kind of good news you might be able to build on. Here's a couple related examples. Captive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species. The California condor was down to    birds in     . Everybody thought is was finished. Thanks to captive breeding at the San Diego Zoo  there's     of them now      are out in the wild. That technology will be used on de extincted animals. Another success story is the mountain gorilla in Central Africa. In       Dian Fossey was sure they were going extinct. There were just     left. Now there are    . They're increasing in population by three percent a year. The secret is  they have an eco tourism program  which is absolutely brilliant. So this photograph was taken last month by Ryan with an iPhone. That's how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors. Another interesting project  though it's going to need some help  is the northern white rhinoceros. There's no breeding pairs left. But this is the kind of thing that a wide variety of DNA for this animal is available in the frozen zoo. A bit of cloning  you can get them back. So where do we go from here  These have been private meetings so far. I think it's time for the subject to go public. What do people think about it  You know  do you want extinct species back  Do you want extinct species back  Tinker Bell is going to come fluttering down. It is a Tinker Bell moment  because what are people excited about with this  What are they concerned about  We're also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon. So Ben Novak  even as we speak  is joining the group that Beth Shapiro has at UC Santa Cruz. They're going to work on the genomes of the passenger pigeon and the band tailed pigeon. As that data matures  they'll send it to George Church  who will work his magic  get passenger pigeon DNA out of that. We'll get help from Bob Lanza and Mike McGrew to get that into germ plasm that can go into chickens that can produce passenger pigeon squabs that can be raised by band tailed pigeon parents  and then from then on  it's passenger pigeons all the way  maybe for the next six million years. You can do the same thing  as the costs come down  for the Carolina parakeet  for the great auk  for the heath hen  for the ivory billed woodpecker  for the Eskimo curlew  for the Caribbean monk seal  for the woolly mammoth. Because the fact is  humans have made a huge hole in nature in the last        years. We have the ability now  and maybe the moral obligation  to repair some of the damage. Most of that we'll do by expanding and protecting wildlands  by expanding and protecting the populations of endangered species. But some species that we killed off totally we could consider bringing back to a world that misses them. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. I've got a question. So  this is an emotional topic. Some people stand. I suspect there are some people out there sitting  kind of asking tormented questions  almost  about  well  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait a minute  there's something wrong with mankind interfering in nature in this way. There's going to be unintended consequences. You're going to uncork some sort of Pandora's box of who knows what. Do they have a point  Stewart Brand  Well  the earlier point is we interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct  and many of them were keystone species  and we changed the whole ecosystem they were in by letting them go. Now  there's the shifting baseline problem  which is  so when these things come back  they might replace some birds that are there that people really know and love. I think that's  you know  part of how it'll work. This is a long  slow process    One of the things I like about it  it's multi generation. We will get woolly mammoths back. CA  Well it feels like both the conversation and the potential here are pretty thrilling. Thank you so much for presenting. SB  Thank you. CA  Thank you.  Applause  Chris Anderson asked me if I could put the last    years of anti poverty campaigning into    minutes for TED. That's an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct. I said   Chris  that would take a miracle.  He said   Bono  wouldn't that be a good use of your messianic complex   So  yeah. Then I thought  let's go even further than    years. Let's go back before Christ  three millennia  to a time when  at least in my head  the journey for justice  the march against inequality and poverty really began. Three thousand years ago  civilization just getting started on the banks of the Nile  some slaves  Jewish shepherds in this instance  smelling of sheep shit  I guess  proclaimed to the Pharaoh  sitting high on his throne   We  your majesty ness  are equal to you.  And the Pharaoh replies   Oh  no. You  your miserableness  have got to be kidding.  And they say   No  no  that's what it says here in our holy book.  Cut to our century  same country  same pyramids  another people spreading the same idea of equality with a different book. This time it's called the Facebook. Crowds are gathered in Tahrir Square. They turn a social network from virtual to actual  and kind of rebooted the   st century. Not to undersell how messy and ugly the aftermath of the Arab Spring has been  neither to oversell the role of technology  but these things have given a sense of what's possible when the age old model of power  the pyramid  gets turned upside down  putting the people on top and the pharaohs of today on the bottom  as it were. It's also shown us that something as powerful as information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality  because facts  like people  want to be free  and when they're free  liberty is usually around the corner  even for the poorest of the poor    facts that can challenge cynicism and the apathy that leads to inertia  facts that tell us what's working and  more importantly  what's not  so we can fix it  facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us meet the challenge that Nelson Mandela made back in       when he asked us to be that great generation that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity  extreme poverty  facts that build a powerful momentum. So I thought  forget the rock opera  forget the bombast  my usual tricks. The only thing singing today would be the facts  for I have truly embraced by inner nerd. So exit the rock star. Enter the evidence based activist  the factivist. Because what the facts are telling us is that the long  slow journey  humanity's long  slow journey of equality  is actually speeding up. Look at what's been achieved. Look at the pictures these data sets print. Since the year       since the turn of the millennium  there are eight million more AIDS patients getting life saving antiretroviral drugs. Malaria  There are eight countries in sub Saharan Africa that have their death rates cut by    percent. For kids under five  child mortality  kids under five  it's down by  .   million a year. That's a rate of       children's lives saved each day. Wow. Wow.  Applause  Let's just stop for a second  actually  and think about that. Have you read anything anywhere in the last week that is remotely as important as that number  Wow. Great news. It drives me nuts that most people don't seem to know this news. Seven thousand kids a day. Here's two of them. This is Michael and Benedicta  and they're alive thanks in large part to Dr. Patricia Asamoah    she's amazing    and the Global Fund  which all of you financially support  whether you know it or not. And the Global Fund provides antiretroviral drugs that stop mothers from passing HIV to their kids. This fantastic news didn't happen by itself. It was fought for  it was campaigned for  it was innovated for. And this great news gives birth to even more great news  because the historic trend is this. The number of people living in back breaking  soul crushing extreme poverty has declined from    percent of the world's population in      to    percent by      and then to    percent by     . Give it up for that.  Applause  Halved. Halved. Now  the rate is still too high    still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives. There's still work to do. But it's heart stopping. It's mind blowing stuff. And if you live on less than   .   a day  if you live in that kind of poverty  this is not just data. This is everything. If you're a parent who wants the best for your kids    and I am    this rapid transition is a route out of despair and into hope. And guess what  If the trajectory continues  look where the amount of people living on   .   a day gets to by     . Can't be true  can it  That's what the data is telling us. If the trajectory continues  we get to  wow  the zero zone. For number crunchers like us  that is the erogenous zone  and it's fair to say that I am  by now  sexually aroused by the collating of data. So virtual elimination of extreme poverty  as defined by people living on less than   .   a day  adjusted  of course  for inflation from a      baseline. We do love a good baseline. That's amazing. Now I know that some of you think this progress is all in Asia or Latin America or model countries like Brazil    and who doesn't love a Brazilian model     but look at sub Saharan Africa. There's a collection of    countries  some call them the lions  who in the last decade have had a combination of     percent debt cancellation  a tripling of aid  a tenfold increase in FDI    that's foreign direct investment    which has unlocked a quadrupling of domestic resources    that's local money    which  when spent wisely    that's good governance    cut childhood mortality by a third  doubled education completion rates  and they  too  halved extreme poverty  and at this rate  these    get to zero too. So the pride of lions is the proof of concept. There are all kinds of benefits to this. For a start  you won't have to listen to an insufferable little jumped up Jesus like myself. How about that   Applause  And             It's just around the corner. I mean  it's about three Rolling Stones farewell concerts away. Makes us look really young. So why aren't we jumping up and down about this  Well  the opportunity is real  but so is the jeopardy. We can't get this done until we really accept that we can get this done. Look at this graph. It's called inertia. It's how we screw it up. And the next one is really beautiful. It's called momentum. And it's how we can bend the arc of history down towards zero  just doing the things that we know work. So inertia versus momentum. There is jeopardy  and of course  the closer you get  it gets harder. We know the obstacles that are in our way right now  in difficult times. In fact  today in your capital  in difficult times  some who mind the nation's purse want to cut life saving programs like the Global Fund. But you can do something about that. You can tell politicians that these cuts  can cost  lives. Right now today  in Oslo as it happens  oil companies are fighting to keep secret their payments to governments for extracting oil in developing countries. You can do something about that too. You can join the One Campaign  and leaders like Mo Ibrahim  the telecom entrepreneur. We're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some of the wealth under the ground ends up in the hands of the people living above it. And right now  we know that the biggest disease of all is not a disease. It's corruption. But there's a vaccine for that too. It's called transparency  open data sets  something the TED community is really on it. Daylight  you could call it  transparency. And technology is really turbocharging this. It's getting harder to hide if you're doing bad stuff. So let me tell you about the U report  which I'm really excited about. It's         millennials all across Uganda  young people armed with  G phones  an SMS social network exposing government corruption and demanding to know what's in the budget and how their money is being spent. This is exciting stuff. Look  once you have these tools  you can't not use them. Once you have this knowledge  you can't un know it. You can't delete this data from your brain  but you can delete the cliched image of supplicant  impoverished peoples not taking control of their own lives. You can erase that  you really can  because it's not true anymore.  Applause  It's transformational.       By       robots  not just serving us Guinness  but drinking it. By the time we get there  every place with a rough semblance of governance might actually be on their way. So I'm here to    I guess we're here to try and infect you with this virtuous  data based virus  the one we call factivism. It's not going to kill you. In fact  it could save countless lives. I guess we in the One Campaign would love you to be contagious  spread it  share it  pass it on. By doing so  you will join us and countless others in what I truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken  the ever demanding journey of equality. Could we really be the great generation that Mandela asked us to be  Might we answer that clarion call with science  with reason  with facts  and  dare I say it  emotions  Because as is obvious  factivists have feelings too. I'm thinking of Wael Ghonim  though. Some of you know him. He set up one of the Facebook groups behind the Tahrir Square in Cairo. He got thrown in jail for it  but I have his words tattooed on my brain.  We are going to win because we don't understand politics. We are going to win because we don't play their dirty games. We are going to win because we don't have a party political agenda. We are going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts. We are going to win because we have dreams  and we're willing to stand up for those dreams.  Wael is right. We're going to win if we work together as one  because the power of the people is so much stronger than the people in power. Thank you. Thank you so much.  Applause  I have a friend in Portugal whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle and a washing machine so he could transport his family. He did it because he couldn't afford a car  but also because he knew how to build one. There was a time when we understood how things worked and how they were made  so we could build and repair them  or at the very least make informed decisions about what to buy. Many of these do it yourself practices were lost in the second half of the   th century. But now  the maker community and the open source model are bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work and what they're made of back into our lives  and I believe we need to take them to the next level  to the components things are made of. For the most part  we still know what traditional materials like paper and textiles are made of and how they are produced. But now we have these amazing  futuristic composites    plastics that change shape  paints that conduct electricity  pigments that change color  fabrics that light up. Let me show you some examples. So conductive ink allows us to paint circuits instead of using the traditional printed circuit boards or wires. In the case of this little example I'm holding  we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin by turning on this little light. Conductive ink has been used by artists  but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able to use it in laser printers and pens. And this is a sheet of acrylic infused with colorless light diffusing particles. What this means is that  while regular acrylic only diffuses light around the edges  this one illuminates across the entire surface when I turn on the lights around it. Two of the known applications for this material include interior design and multi touch systems. And thermochromic pigments change color at a given temperature. So I'm going to place this on a hot plate that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient and you can see what happens. So one of the principle applications for this material is  amongst other things  in baby bottles  so it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink. So these are just a few of what are commonly known as smart materials. In a few years  they will be in many of the objects and technologies we use on a daily basis. We may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us  but we can have walls that change color depending on temperature  keyboards that roll up  and windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch. So I'm a social scientist by training  so why am I here today talking about smart materials  Well first of all  because I am a maker. I'm curious about how things work and how they are made  but also because I believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world  and right now  we don't know enough about these high tech composites our future will be made of. Smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities. There's barely any information available on how to use them  and very little is said about how they are produced. So for now  they exist mostly in this realm of trade secrets and patents only universities and corporations have access to. So a little over three years ago  Kirsty Boyle and I started a project we called Open Materials. It's a website where we  and anyone else who wants to join us  share experiments  publish information  encourage others to contribute whenever they can  and aggregate resources such as research papers and tutorials by other makers like ourselves. We would like it to become a large  collectively generated database of do it yourself information on smart materials. But why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of  First of all  because we can't shape what we don't understand  and what we don't understand and use ends up shaping us. The objects we use  the clothes we wear  the houses we live in  all have a profound impact on our behavior  health and quality of life. So if we are to live in a world made of smart materials  we should know and understand them. Secondly  and just as important  innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers. So many times  amateurs  not experts  have been the inventors and improvers of things ranging from mountain bikes to semiconductors  personal computers  airplanes. The biggest challenge is that material science is complex and requires expensive equipment. But that's not always the case. Two scientists at University of Illinois understood this when they published a paper on a simpler method for making conductive ink. Jordan Bunker  who had had no experience with chemistry until then  read this paper and reproduced the experiment at his maker space using only off the shelf substances and tools. He used a toaster oven  and he even made his own vortex mixer  based on a tutorial by another scientist maker. Jordan then published his results online  including all the things he had tried and didn't work  so others could study and reproduce it. So Jordan's main form of innovation was to take an experiment created in a well equipped lab at the university and recreate it in a garage in Chicago using only cheap materials and tools he made himself. And now that he published this work  others can pick up where he left and devise even simpler processes and improvements. Another example I'd like to mention is Hannah Perner Wilson's Kit of No Parts. Her project's goal is to highlight the expressive qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder. Electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work  but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn. So Hannah's approach  on the other hand  is to formulate a series of techniques for creating unusual objects that free us from pre designed constraints by teaching us about the materials themselves. So amongst Hannah's many impressive experiments  this is one of my favorites.   Paper speakers   What we're seeing here is just a piece of paper with some copper tape on it connected to an mp  player and a magnet. So based on the research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT  Hannah created a series of paper speakers out of a wide range of materials from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink. Just like Jordan and so many other makers  Hannah published her recipes and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them. But paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics. So Hannah's artisanal work  and the fact that she shared her findings  opens the doors to a series of new possibilities that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative. So the interesting thing about makers is that we create out of passion and curiosity  and we are not afraid to fail. We often tackle problems from unconventional angles  and  in the process  end up discovering alternatives or even better ways to do things. So the more people experiment with materials  the more researchers are willing to share their research  and manufacturers their knowledge  the better chances we have to create technologies that truly serve us all. So I feel a bit as Ted Nelson must have when  in the early     s  he wrote   You must understand computers now.  Back then  computers were these large mainframes only scientists cared about  and no one dreamed of even having one at home. So it's a little strange that I'm standing here and saying   You must understand smart materials now.  Just keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge about emerging technologies is the best way to ensure that we have a say in the making of our future. Thank you. So  this book that I have in my hand is a directory of everybody who had an email address in     .  Laughter  Actually  it's deceptively large. There's actually only about    people on each page  because we have the name  address and telephone number of every single person. And  in fact  everybody's listed twice  because it's sorted once by name and once by email address. Obviously a very small community. There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then. I knew them both. We didn't all know each other  but we all kind of trusted each other  and that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network  and there was a real sense that we could depend on each other to do things. So just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community  let me tell you what it was like to register a domain name in the early days. Now  it just so happened that I got to register the third domain name on the Internet. So I could have anything I wanted other than bbn.com and symbolics.com. So I picked think.com  but then I thought  you know  there's a lot of really interesting names out there. Maybe I should register a few extras just in case. And then I thought   Nah  that wouldn't be very nice.  That attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days  and in fact  it wasn't just the people on the network  but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the Internet itself. So the basic idea of I.P.  or Internet protocol  and the way that the    the routing algorithm that used it  were fundamentally  from each according to their ability  to each according to their need.  And so  if you had some extra bandwidth  you'd deliver a message for someone. If they had some extra bandwidth  they would deliver a message for you. You'd kind of depend on people to do that  and that was the building block. It was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War by the Defense Department  but it obviously worked really well  and we all saw what happened with the Internet. It was incredibly successful. In fact  it was so successful that there's no way that these days you could make a book like this. My rough calculation is it would be about    miles thick. But  of course  you couldn't do it  because we don't know the names of all the people with Internet or email addresses  and even if we did know their names  I'm pretty sure that they would not want their name  address and telephone number published to everyone. So the fact is that there's a lot of bad guys on the Internet these days  and so we dealt with that by making walled communities  secure subnetworks  VPNs  little things that aren't really the Internet but are made out of the same building blocks  but we're still basically building it out of those same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust. And that means that it's vulnerable to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen  or certain kinds of deliberate attacks  but even the mistakes can be bad. So  for instance  in all of Asia recently  it was impossible to get YouTube for a little while because Pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring YouTube in its internal network. They didn't intend to screw up Asia  but they did because of the way that the protocols work. Another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is  you may remember a couple of years ago  all the planes west of the Mississippi were grounded because a single routing card in Salt Lake City had a bug in it. Now  you don't really think that our airplane system depends on the Internet  and in some sense it doesn't. I'll come back to that later. But the fact is that people couldn't take off because something was going wrong on the Internet  and the router card was down. And so  there are many of those things that start to happen. Now  there was an interesting thing that happened last April. All of a sudden  a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole Internet  including a lot of the traffic between U.S. military installations  started getting re routed through China. So for a few hours  it all passed through China. Now  China Telecom says it was just an honest mistake  and it is actually possible that it was  the way things work  but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to  and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes. Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks. So if somebody really wanted to attack the United States or Western civilization these days  they're not going to do it with tanks. That will not succeed. What they'll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the Iranian nuclear facility. Nobody has claimed credit for that. There was basically a factory of industrial machines. It didn't think of itself as being on the Internet. It thought of itself as being disconnected from the Internet  but it was possible for somebody to smuggle a USB drive in there  or something like that  and software got in there that causes the centrifuges  in that case  to actually destroy themselves. Now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant. And so there's a lot of    I'm sure you've read a lot in papers  about worries about cyberattacks and defenses against those. But the fact is  people are mostly focused on defending the computers on the Internet  and there's been surprisingly little attention to defending the Internet itself as a communications medium. And I think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that  because it's actually kind of fragile. So actually  in the early days  back when it was the ARPANET  there were actually times    there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message processor actually got a bug in it. And the way the Internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places  and this one processor  because of a broken card  decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time. So  in other words  it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it. So of course  the fastest way to get a message anywhere was to send it to this guy  who would send it back in time and get it there super early  so every message in the Internet started getting switched through this one node  and of course that clogged everything up. Everything started breaking. The interesting thing was  though  that the sysadmins were able to fix it  but they had to basically turn every single thing on the Internet off. Now  of course you couldn't do that today. I mean  everything off  it's like the service call you get from the cable company  except for the whole world. Now  in fact  they couldn't do it for a lot of reasons today. One of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use IP protocol and use things like Skype and so on that go through the Internet right now  and so in fact we're becoming dependent on it for more and more different things  like when you take off from LAX  you're really not thinking you're using the Internet. When you pump gas  you really don't think you're using the Internet. What's happening increasingly  though  is these systems are beginning to use the Internet. Most of them aren't based on the Internet yet  but they're starting to use the Internet for service functions  for administrative functions  and so if you take something like the cell phone system  which is still relatively independent of the Internet for the most part  Internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it in terms of some of the control and administrative functions  and it's so tempting to use these same building blocks because they work so well  they're cheap  they're repeated  and so on. So all of our systems  more and more  are starting to use the same technology and starting to depend on this technology. And so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses Internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship to the other. That's crazy. It was never designed to do things like that. So we've built this system where we understand all the parts of it  but we're using it in a very  very different way than we expected to use it  and it's gotten a very  very different scale than it was designed for. And in fact  nobody really exactly understands all the things it's being used for right now. It's turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system  where we've designed all the parts but nobody really exactly understands how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have. And so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet and saying it can do this  or it does do this  or it will do that  you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weatherman about the weather  or something like that. They have an informed opinion  but it's changing so quickly that even the experts don't know exactly what's going on. So if you see one of these maps of the Internet  it's just somebody's guess. Nobody really knows what the Internet is right now because it's different than it was an hour ago. It's constantly changing. It's constantly reconfiguring. And the problem with it is  I think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system  where we take a system that's basically built on trust  was basically built for a smaller scale system  and we've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate. And so right now  I think it's literally true that we don't know what the consequences of an effective denial of service attack on the Internet would be  and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year  and worse next year  and so on. But so what we need is a plan B. There is no plan B right now. There's no clear backup system that we've very carefully kept to be independent of the Internet  made out of completely different sets of building blocks. So what we need is something that doesn't necessarily have to have the performance of the Internet  but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the Internet  or the hospitals have to order fuel oil. This doesn't need to be a multi billion dollar government project. It's actually relatively simple to do  technically  because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground  existing wireless infrastructure. It's basically a matter of deciding to do it. But people won't decide to do it until they recognize the need for it  and that's the problem that we have right now. So there's been plenty of people  plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years  but it's very hard to get people focused on plan B when plan A seems to be working so well. So I think that  if people understand how much we're starting to depend on the Internet  and how vulnerable it is  we could get focused on just wanting this other system to exist  and I think if enough people say   Yeah  I would like to use it  I'd like to have such a system   then it will get built. It's not that hard a problem. It could definitely be done by people in this room. And so I think that this is actually  of all the problems you're going to hear about at the conference  this is probably one of the very easiest to fix. So I'm happy to get a chance to tell you about it. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Elon  what kind of crazy dream would persuade you to think of trying to take on the auto industry and build an all electric car  Elon Musk  Well  it goes back to when I was in university. I thought about  what are the problems that are most likely to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity  I think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production. That sort of overall sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century  independent of environmental concerns. In fact  even if producing CO  was good for the environment  given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons  we need to find some sustainable means of operating. CA  Most of American electricity comes from burning fossil fuels. How can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help  EM  Right. There's two elements to that answer. One is that  even if you take the same source fuel and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars  you're still better off. So if you take  say  natural gas  which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel  if you burn that in a modern General Electric natural gas turbine  you'll get about    percent efficiency. If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car  you get about    percent efficiency. And the reason is  in the stationary power plant  you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more  is voluminous  and you can take the waste heat and run a steam turbine and generate a secondary power source. So in effect  even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything  even using the same source fuel  you're at least twice as better off charging an electric car  then burning it at the power plant. CA  That scale delivers efficiency. EM  Yes  it does. And then the other point is  we have to have sustainable means of power generation anyway  electricity generation. So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation  then it makes sense for us to have electric cars as the mode of transport. CA  So we've got some video here of the Tesla being assembled  which  if we could play that first video    So what is innovative about this process in this vehicle  EM  Sure. So  in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport  and I should say that I think  actually  all modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets. There's just no way around Newton's third law. The question is how do you accelerate the advent of electric transport  And in order to do that for cars  you have to come up with a really energy efficient car  so that means making it incredibly light  and so what you're seeing here is the only all aluminum body and chassis car made in North America. In fact  we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack. And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size. So as a result  the energy usage is very low  and it has the most advanced battery pack  and that's what gives it the range that's competitive  so you can actually have on the order of a     mile range. CA  I mean  those battery packs are incredibly heavy  but you think the math can still work out intelligently    by combining light body  heavy battery  you can still gain spectacular efficiency. EM  Exactly. The rest of the car has to be very light to offset the mass of the pack  and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range. And in fact  customers of the Model S are sort of competing with each other to try to get the highest possible range. I think somebody recently got     miles out of a single charge. CA  Bruno Bowden  who's here  did that  broke the world record.EM  Congratulations. CA  That was the good news. The bad news was that to do it  he had to drive at    miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops.  Laughter  EM  I mean  you can certainly drive    if you drive it    miles an hour  under normal conditions      miles is a reasonable number. CA  Let's show that second video showing the Tesla in action on ice. Not at all a dig at The New York Times  this  by the way. What is the most surprising thing about the experience of driving the car  EM  In creating an electric car  the responsiveness of the car is really incredible. So we wanted really to have people feel as though they've almost got to mind meld with the car  so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one  and as you corner and accelerate  it just happens  like the car has ESP. You can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness. You can't do that with a gasoline car. I think that's really a profound difference  and people only experience that when they have a test drive. CA  I mean  this is a beautiful but expensive car. Is there a road map where this becomes a mass market vehicle  EM  Yeah. The goal of Tesla has always been to have a sort of three step process  where version one was an expensive car at low volume  version two is medium priced and medium volume  and then version three would be low price  high volume. So we're at step two at this point. So we had a          sports car  which was the Roadster. Then we've got the Model S  which starts at around        dollars. And our third generation car  which should hopefully be out in about three or four years will be a         car. But whenever you've got really new technology  it generally takes about three major versions in order to make it a compelling mass market product. And so I think we're making progress in that direction  and I feel confident that we'll get there. CA  I mean  right now  if you've got a short commute  you can drive  you can get back  you can charge it at home. There isn't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast. Do you see that coming  really  truly  or just on a few key routes  EM  There actually are far more charging stations than people realize  and at Tesla we developed something called a Supercharging technology  and we're offering that if you buy a Model S for free  forever. And so this is something that maybe a lot of people don't realize. We actually have California and Nevada covered  and we've got the Eastern seaboard from Boston to D.C. covered. By the end of this year  you'll be able to drive from L.A. to New York just using the Supercharger network  which charges at five times the rate of anything else. And the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop  to stop time  of about six or seven. So if you drive for three hours  you want to stop for    or    minutes  because that's normally what people will stop for. So if you start a trip at   a.m.  by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat  hit the restroom  coffee  and keep going. CA  So your proposition to consumers is  for the full charge  it could take an hour. So it's common    don't expect to be out of here in    minutes. Wait for an hour  but the good news is  you're helping save the planet  and by the way  the electricity is free. You don't pay anything. EM  Actually  what we're expecting is for people to stop for about    to    minutes  not for an hour. It's actually better to drive for about maybe          miles and then stop for half an hour and then keep going. That's the natural cadence of a trip. CA  All right. So this is only one string to your energy bow. You've been working on this solar company SolarCity. What's unusual about that  EM  Well  as I mentioned earlier  we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption  so I'm quite confident that the primary means of power generation will be solar. I mean  it's really indirect fusion  is what it is. We've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun  and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy for purposes of human civilization. What most people know but don't realize they know is that the world is almost entirely solar powered already. If the sun wasn't there  we'd be a frozen ice ball at three degrees Kelvin  and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation. The whole ecosystem is solar powered. CA  But in a gallon of gasoline  you have  effectively  thousands of years of sun power compressed into a small space  so it's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar  and to remotely compete with  for example  natural gas  fracked natural gas. How are you going to build a business here  EM  Well actually  I'm confident that solar will beat everything  hands down  including natural gas. EM  It must  actually. If it doesn't  we're in deep trouble. CA  But you're not selling solar panels to consumers. What are you doing  EM  No  we actually are. You can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system. Most people choose to lease. And the thing about solar power is that it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs  so once it's installed  it's just there. It works for decades. It'll work for probably a century. So therefore  the key thing to do is to get the cost of that initial installation low  and then get the cost of the financing low  because that interest    those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar. And we've made huge progress in that direction  and that's why I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas. CA  So your current proposition to consumers is  don't pay so much up front. EM  Zero.CA  Pay zero up front. We will install panels on your roof. You will then pay  how long is a typical lease  EM  Typical leases are    years  but the value proposition is  as you're sort of alluding to  quite straightforward. It's no money down  and your utility bill decreases. Pretty good deal. CA  So that seems like a win for the consumer. No risk  you'll pay less than you're paying now. For you  the dream here then is that    I mean  who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer term  I mean  how do you  the company  benefit  EM  Well  essentially  SolarCity raises a chunk of capital from say  a company or a bank. Google is one of our big partners here. And they have an expected return on that capital. With that capital  SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof and then charges the homeowner or business owner a monthly lease payment  which is less than the utility bill. CA  But you yourself get a long term commercial benefit from that power. You're kind of building a new type of distributed utility. EM  Exactly. What it amounts to is a giant distributed utility. I think it's a good thing  because utilities have been this monopoly  and people haven't had any choice. So effectively it's the first time there's been competition for this monopoly  because the utilities have been the only ones that owned those power distribution lines  but now it's on your roof. So I think it's actually very empowering for homeowners and businesses. CA  And you really picture a future where a majority of power in America  within a decade or two  or within your lifetime  it goes solar  EM  I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power  and most likely a majority  and I predict it will be a plurality in less than    years. I made that bet with someone  CA  Definition of plurality is  EM  More from solar than any other source. CA  Ah. Who did you make the bet with  EM  With a friend who will remain nameless. CA  Just between us.  Laughter  EM  I made that bet  I think  two or three years ago  so in roughly    years  I think we'll see more power from solar than any other source. CA  All right  so let's go back to another bet that you made with yourself  I guess  a kind of crazy bet. You'd made some money from the sale of PayPal. You decided to build a space company. Why on Earth would someone do that  EM  I got that question a lot  that's true. People would say   Did you hear the joke about the guy who made a small fortune in the space industry   Obviously   He started with a large one   is the punchline. And so I tell people  well  I was trying to figure out the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one. And they'd look at me  like   Is he serious   CA  And strangely  you were. So what happened  EM  It was a close call. Things almost didn't work out. We came very close to failure  but we managed to get through that point in     . The goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology  and in particular to try to crack a problem that I think is vital for humanity to become a space faring civilization  which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket. CA  Would humanity become a space faring civilization  So that was a dream of yours  in a way  from a young age  You've dreamed of Mars and beyond  EM  I did build rockets when I was a kid  but I didn't think I'd be involved in this. It was really more from the standpoint of what are the things that need to happen in order for the future to be an exciting and inspiring one  And I really think there's a fundamental difference  if you sort of look into the future  between a humanity that is a space faring civilization  that's out there exploring the stars  on multiple planets  and I think that's really exciting  compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event. CA  So you've somehow slashed the cost of building a rocket by    percent  depending on how you calculate it. How on Earth have you done that  NASA has been doing this for years. How have you done this  EM  Well  we've made significant advances in the technology of the airframe  the engines  the electronics and the launch operation. There's a long list of innovations that we've come up with there that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk  but    CA  Not least because you could still get copied  right  You haven't patented this stuff. It's really interesting to me. EM  No  we don't patent.CA  You didn't patent because you think it's more dangerous to patent than not to patent. EM  Since our primary competitors are national governments  the enforceability of patents is questionable. Laughter   Applause  CA  That's really  really interesting. But the big innovation is still ahead  and you're working on it now. Tell us about this. EM  Right  so the big innovation  CA  In fact  let's roll that video and you can talk us through it  what's happening here. EM  Absolutely. So the thing about rockets is that they're all expendable. All rockets that fly today are fully expendable. The space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket  but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time  and the parts that were reusable took a        person group nine months to refurbish for flight. So the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight. Obviously that doesn't work very well for   CA  What just happened there  We just saw something land  EM  That's right. So it's important that the rocket stages be able to come back  to be able to return to the launch site and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours. CA  Wow. Reusable rockets.EM  Yes.  Applause  And so what a lot of people don't realize is  the cost of the fuel  of the propellant  is very small. It's much like on a jet. So the cost of the propellant is about .  percent of the cost of the rocket. So it's possible to achieve  let's say  roughly     fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight if you can effectively reuse the rocket. That's why it's so important. Every mode of transport that we use  whether it's planes  trains  automobiles  bikes  horses  is reusable  but not rockets. So we must solve this problem in order to become a space faring civilization. CA  You asked me the question earlier of how popular traveling on cruises would be if you had to burn your ships afterward.EM  Certain cruises are apparently highly problematic. CA  Definitely more expensive. So that's potentially absolutely disruptive technology  and  I guess  paves the way for your dream to actually take  at some point  to take humanity to Mars at scale. You'd like to see a colony on Mars. EM  Yeah  exactly. SpaceX  or some combination of companies and governments  needs to make progress in the direction of making life multi planetary  of establishing a base on another planet  on Mars    being the only realistic option    and then building that base up until we're a true multi planet species. CA  So progress on this  let's make it reusable   how is that going  That was just a simulation video we saw. How's it going  EM  We're actually  we've been making some good progress recently with something we call the Grasshopper Test Project  where we're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight  the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky. And we've had some good tests. CA  Can we see that EM  Yeah. So that's just to give a sense of scale. We dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket.  Laughter  CA  All right  let's see that video then  because this is actually amazing when you think about it. You've never seen this before. A rocket blasting off and then    EM  Yeah  so that rocket is about the size of a    story building. So now it's hovering at about    meters  and it's constantly adjusting the angle  the pitch  and yaw of the main engine  and maintaining roll  with cold gas thrusters. CA  How cool is that   Applause  Elon  how have you done this  These projects are so    Paypal  SolarCity  Tesla  SpaceX  they're so spectacularly different  they're such ambitious projects at scale. How on Earth has one person been able to innovate in this way  What is it about you  EM  I don't know  actually. I don't have a good answer for you. I work a lot. I mean  a lot. CA  Well  I have a theory.EM  Okay. All right. CA  My theory is that you have an ability to think at a system level of design that pulls together design  technology and business  so if TED was TBD  design  technology and business  into one package  synthesize it in a way that very few people can and    and this is the critical thing    feel so damn confident in that clicked together package that you take crazy risks. You bet your fortune on it  and you seem to have done that multiple times. I mean  almost no one can do that. Is that    could we have some of that secret sauce  Can we put it into our education system  Can someone learn from you  It is truly amazing what you've done. EM  Well  thanks. Thank you. Well  I do think there's a good framework for thinking. It is physics. You know  the sort of first principles reasoning. Generally I think there are    what I mean by that is  boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there  as opposed to reasoning by analogy. Through most of our life  we get through life by reasoning by analogy  which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations. And you have to do that. Otherwise  mentally  you wouldn't be able to get through the day. But when you want to do something new  you have to apply the physics approach. Physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive  like quantum mechanics. It's really counterintuitive. So I think that's an important thing to do  and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback  and solicit it  particularly from friends. This may sound like simple advice  but hardly anyone does that  and it's incredibly helpful. CA  Boys and girls watching  study physics. Learn from this man. Elon Musk  I wish we had all day  but thank you so much for coming to TED. EM  Thank you. CA  That was awesome. That was really  really cool. Look at that.  Applause  Just take a bow. That was fantastic. Thank you so much. When I was little  I thought my country was the best on the planet. And I grew up singing a song called  Nothing To Envy.  And I was very proud. In school  we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il Sung  but we never learned much about the outside world  except that America  South Korea  Japan are the enemies. Although I often wondered about the outside world  I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea  until everything suddenly changed. When I was seven years old  I saw my first public execution. But I thought my life in North Korea was normal. My family was not poor  and myself  I had never experienced hunger. But one day  in       my mom brought home a letter from a coworker's sister. It read   When you read this  our five family members will not exist in this world  because we haven't eaten for the past three weeks. We are lying on the floor together  and our bodies are so weak  we are waiting to die.  I was so shocked. This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering. Soon after  when I was walking past a train station  I saw something terrible that to this day I can't erase from my memory. A lifeless woman was lying on the ground  while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother's face. But nobody helped them  because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families. A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid     s. Ultimately  more than a million North Koreans died during the famine  and many only survived by eating grass  bugs and tree bark. Power outages also became more and more frequent  so everything around me was completely dark at night  except for the sea of lights in China  just across the river from my home. I always wondered why they had lights  but we didn't. This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night  compared to neighbors. This is the Amnok River  which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China. As you can see  the river can be very narrow at certain points  allowing North Koreans to secretly cross. But many die. Sometimes  I saw dead bodies floating down the river. I can't reveal many details about how I left North Korea  but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine  I was sent to China to live with distant relatives. But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time. I could have never imagined that it would take    years to live together. In China  it was hard living as a young girl without my family. I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee. But I soon learned it's not only extremely difficult  it's also very dangerous  since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants. So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed  and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate  back in North Korea. One day  my worst nightmare came true  when I was caught by the Chinese police  and brought to the police station for interrogation. Someone had accused me of being North Korean  so they tested my Chinese language abilities  and asked me tons of questions. I was so scared. I thought my heart was going to explode. If anything seemed unnatural  I could be imprisoned and repatriated. I thought my life was over. But I managed to control all the emotions inside me  and answer the questions. After they finished questioning me  one official said to another   This was a false report. She's not North Korean.  And they let me go. It was a miracle. Some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies. But many can be caught by the Chinese police  and repatriated. These girls were so lucky. Even though they were caught  they were eventually released  after heavy international pressure. These North Koreans were not so lucky. Every year  countless North Koreans are caught in China and repatriated to North Korea  where they can be tortured  imprisoned  or publicly executed. Even though I was really fortunate to get out  many other North Koreans have not been so lucky. It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive. Even after learning a new language and getting a job  their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant. That's why  after    years of hiding my identity  I decided to risk going to South Korea. And I started a new life yet again. Settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected. English was so important in South Korea  so I had to start learning my third language. Also  I realized there was a wide gap between North and South. We are all Korean  but inside  we have become very different  due to    years of division. I even went through an identity crisis. Am I South Korean or North Korean  Where am I from  Who am I  Suddenly  there was no country I could proudly call my own. Even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy  I made a plan    I started studying for the university entrance exam. Just as I was starting to get used to my new life  I received a shocking phone call. The North Korean authorities intercepted some money that I sent to my family  and  as a punishment  my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside. They had to get out quickly. So I started planning how to help them escape. North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom. It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea. So  ironically  I took a flight back to China and headed toward the North Korean border. Since my family couldn't speak Chinese  I had to guide them somehow through more than       miles in China  and then into Southeast Asia. The journey by bus took one week  and we were almost caught several times. One time  our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer. He took everyone's I.D. cards  and he started asking them questions. Since my family couldn't understand Chinese  I thought my family was going to be arrested. As the Chinese officer approached my family  I impulsively stood up  and I told him that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning. He looked at me suspiciously  but luckily  he believed me. We made it all the way to the border of Laos. But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Laos. But even after we got past the border  my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing. After I paid the fine and bribe  my family was released in one month. But soon after  my family was arrested and jailed again  in the capital of Laos. This was one of the lowest points in my life. I did everything to get my family to freedom  and we came so close  but my family was thrown in jail  just a short distance from the South Korean embassy. I went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station  desperately trying to get my family out. but I didn't have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore. I lost all hope. At that moment  I heard one man's voice ask me   What's wrong   I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask. In my broken English  and with a dictionary  I explained the situation  and without hesitating  the man went to the ATM  and he paid the rest of the money for my family  and two other North Koreans to get out of jail. I thanked him with all my heart  and I asked him   Why are you helping me    I'm not helping you   he said.  I'm helping the North Korean people.  I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life. The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people  when we needed it most. And he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need. Eventually  after our long journey  my family and I were reunited in South Korea. But getting to freedom is only half the battle. Many North Koreans are separated from their families  and when they arrive in a new country  they start with little or no money. So we can benefit from the international community for education  English language training  job training  and more. We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world. Because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside  and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside. I've been so lucky  received so much help and inspiration in my life  so I want to help give aspiring North Koreans a chance to prosper with international support. I'm confident that you will see more and more North Koreans succeeding all over the world  including the TED stage. Thank you. So let me ask for a show of hands. How many people here are over the age of     Well  there do seem to be a few. Well  congratulations  because if you look at this particular slide of U.S. life expectancy  you are now in excess of the average life span of somebody who was born in     . But look what happened in the course of that century. If you follow that curve  you'll see that it starts way down there. There's that dip there for the      flu. And here we are at       average life expectancy of a child born today  age     and we are not done yet. Now  that's the good news. But there's still a lot of work to do. So  for instance  if you ask  how many diseases do we now know the exact molecular basis  Turns out it's about        which is pretty amazing  because most of those molecular discoveries have just happened in the last little while. It's exciting to see that in terms of what we've learned  but how many of those       diseases now have treatments available  Only about    . So we have this huge challenge  this huge gap. You would think this wouldn't be too hard  that we would simply have the ability to take this fundamental information that we're learning about how it is that basic biology teaches us about the causes of disease and build a bridge across this yawning gap between what we've learned about basic science and its application  a bridge that would look maybe something like this  where you'd have to put together a nice shiny way to get from one side to the other. Well  wouldn't it be nice if it was that easy  Unfortunately  it's not. In reality  trying to go from fundamental knowledge to its application is more like this. There are no shiny bridges. You sort of place your bets. Maybe you've got a swimmer and a rowboat and a sailboat and a tugboat and you set them off on their way  and the rains come and the lightning flashes  and oh my gosh  there are sharks in the water and the swimmer gets into trouble  and  uh oh  the swimmer drowned and the sailboat capsized  and that tugboat  well  it hit the rocks  and maybe if you're lucky  somebody gets across. Well  what does this really look like  Well  what is it to make a therapeutic  anyway  What's a drug  A drug is made up of a small molecule of hydrogen  carbon  oxygen  nitrogen  and a few other atoms all cobbled together in a shape  and it's those shapes that determine whether  in fact  that particular drug is going to hit its target. Is it going to land where it's supposed to  So look at this picture here    a lot of shapes dancing around for you. Now what you need to do  if you're trying to develop a new treatment for autism or Alzheimer's disease or cancer is to find the right shape in that mix that will ultimately provide benefit and will be safe. And when you look at what happens to that pipeline  you start out maybe with thousands  tens of thousands of compounds. You weed down through various steps that cause many of these to fail. Ultimately  maybe you can run a clinical trial with four or five of these  and if all goes well     years after you started  you will get one approval. And it will cost you upwards of a billion dollars for that one success. So we have to look at this pipeline the way an engineer would  and say   How can we do better   And that's the main theme of what I want to say to you this morning. How can we make this go faster  How can we make it more successful  Well  let me tell you about a few examples where this has actually worked. One that has just happened in the last few months is the successful approval of a drug for cystic fibrosis. But it's taken a long time to get there. Cystic fibrosis had its molecular cause discovered in      by my group working with another group in Toronto  discovering what the mutation was in a particular gene on chromosome  . That picture you see there  Here it is. That's the same kid. That's Danny Bessette     years later  because this is the year  and it's also the year where Danny got married  where we have  for the first time  the approval by the FDA of a drug that precisely targets the defect in cystic fibrosis based upon all this molecular understanding. That's the good news. The bad news is  this drug doesn't actually treat all cases of cystic fibrosis  and it won't work for Danny  and we're still waiting for that next generation to help him. But it took    years to get this far. That's too long. How do we go faster  Well  one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology  and a very important technology that we depend on for all of this is the human genome  the ability to be able to look at a chromosome  to unzip it  to pull out all the DNA  and to be able to then read out the letters in that DNA code  the A's  C's  G's and T's that are our instruction book and the instruction book for all living things  and the cost of doing this  which used to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars  has in the course of the last    years fallen faster than Moore's Law  down to the point where it is less than        dollars today to have your genome sequenced  or mine  and we're headed for the        genome fairly soon. Well  that's exciting. How does that play out in terms of application to a disease  I want to tell you about another disorder. This one is a disorder which is quite rare. It's called Hutchinson Gilford progeria  and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging. Only about one in every four million kids has this disease  and in a simple way  what happens is  because of a mutation in a particular gene  a protein is made that's toxic to the cell and it causes these individuals to age at about seven times the normal rate. Let me show you a video of what that does to the cell. The normal cell  if you looked at it under the microscope  would have a nucleus sitting in the middle of the cell  which is nice and round and smooth in its boundaries and it looks kind of like that. A progeria cell  on the other hand  because of this toxic protein called progerin  has these lumps and bumps in it. So what we would like to do after discovering this back in      is to come up with a way to try to correct that. Well again  by knowing something about the molecular pathways  it was possible to pick one of those many  many compounds that might have been useful and try it out. In an experiment done in cell culture and shown here in a cartoon  if you take that particular compound and you add it to that cell that has progeria  and you watch to see what happened  in just    hours  that cell becomes  for all purposes that we can determine  almost like a normal cell. Well that was exciting  but would it actually work in a real human being  This has led  in the space of only four years from the time the gene was discovered to the start of a clinical trial  to a test of that very compound. And the kids that you see here all volunteered to be part of this     of them  and you can see as soon as the picture comes up that they are in fact a remarkable group of young people all afflicted by this disease  all looking quite similar to each other. And instead of telling you more about it  I'm going to invite one of them  Sam Berns from Boston  who's here this morning  to come up on the stage and tell us about his experience as a child affected with progeria. Sam is    years old. His parents  Scott Berns and Leslie Gordon  both physicians  are here with us this morning as well. Sam  please have a seat. So Sam  why don't you tell these folks what it's like being affected with this condition called progeria  Sam Burns  Well  progeria limits me in some ways. I cannot play sports or do physical activities  but I have been able to take interest in things that progeria  luckily  does not limit. But when there is something that I really do want to do that progeria gets in the way of  like marching band or umpiring  we always find a way to do it  and that just shows that progeria isn't in control of my life. Francis Collins  So what would you like to say to researchers here in the auditorium and others listening to this  What would you say to them both about research on progeria and maybe about other conditions as well  SB  Well  research on progeria has come so far in less than    years  and that just shows the drive that researchers can have to get this far  and it really means a lot to myself and other kids with progeria  and it shows that if that drive exists  anybody can cure any disease  and hopefully progeria can be cured in the near future  and so we can eliminate those       diseases that Francis was talking about. FC  Excellent. So Sam took the day off from school today to be here  and he is    Applause     He is  by the way  a straight A  student in the ninth grade in his school in Boston. Please join me in thanking and welcoming Sam. SB  Thank you very much. FC  Well done. Well done  buddy. So I just want to say a couple more things about that particular story  and then try to generalize how could we have stories of success all over the place for these diseases  as Sam says  these       that are waiting for answers. You might have noticed that the drug that is now in clinical trial for progeria is not a drug that was designed for that. It's such a rare disease  it would be hard for a company to justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars to generate a drug. This is a drug that was developed for cancer. Turned out  it didn't work very well for cancer  but it has exactly the right properties  the right shape  to work for progeria  and that's what's happened. Wouldn't it be great if we could do that more systematically  Could we  in fact  encourage all the companies that are out there that have drugs in their freezers that are known to be safe in humans but have never actually succeeded in terms of being effective for the treatments they were tried for  Now we're learning about all these new molecular pathways    some of those could be repositioned or repurposed  or whatever word you want to use  for new applications  basically teaching old drugs new tricks. That could be a phenomenal  valuable activity. We have many discussions now between NIH and companies about doing this that are looking very promising. And you could expect quite a lot to come from this. There are quite a number of success stories one can point to about how this has led to major advances. The first drug for HIV AIDS was not developed for HIV AIDS. It was developed for cancer. It was AZT. It didn't work very well for cancer  but became the first successful antiretroviral  and you can see from the table there are others as well. So how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort  Well  we have to come up with a partnership between academia  government  the private sector  and patient organizations to make that so. At NIH  we have started this new National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. It just started last December  and this is one of its goals. Let me tell you another thing we could do. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to a test a drug to see if it's effective and safe without having to put patients at risk  because that first time you're never quite sure  How do we know  for instance  whether drugs are safe before we give them to people  We test them on animals. And it's not all that reliable  and it's costly  and it's time consuming. Suppose we could do this instead on human cells. You probably know  if you've been paying attention to some of the science literature that you can now take a skin cell and encourage it to become a liver cell or a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us. So what if you used those cells as your test for whether a drug is going to work and whether it's going to be safe  Here you see a picture of a lung on a chip. This is something created by the Wyss Institute in Boston  and what they have done here  if we can run the little video  is to take cells from an individual  turn them into the kinds of cells that are present in the lung  and determine what would happen if you added to this various drug compounds to see if they are toxic or safe. You can see this chip even breathes. It has an air channel. It has a blood channel. And it has cells in between that allow you to see what happens when you add a compound. Are those cells happy or not  You can do this same kind of chip technology for kidneys  for hearts  for muscles  all the places where you want to see whether a drug is going to be a problem  for the liver. And ultimately  because you can do this for the individual  we could even see this moving to the point where the ability to develop and test medicines will be you on a chip  what we're trying to say here is the individualizing of the process of developing drugs and testing their safety. So let me sum up. We are in a remarkable moment here. For me  at NIH now for almost    years  there has never been a time where there was more excitement about the potential that lies in front of us. We have made all these discoveries pouring out of laboratories across the world. What do we need to capitalize on this  First of all  we need resources. This is research that's high risk  sometimes high cost. The payoff is enormous  both in terms of health and in terms of economic growth. We need to support that. Second  we need new kinds of partnerships between academia and government and the private sector and patient organizations  just like the one I've been describing here  in terms of the way in which we could go after repurposing new compounds. And third  and maybe most important  we need talent. We need the best and the brightest from many different disciplines to come and join this effort    all ages  all different groups    because this is the time  folks. This is the   st century biology that you've been waiting for  and we have the chance to take that and turn it into something which will  in fact  knock out disease. That's my goal. I hope that's your goal. I think it'll be the goal of the poets and the muppets and the surfers and the bankers and all the other people who join this stage and think about what we're trying to do here and why it matters. It matters for now. It matters as soon as possible. If you don't believe me  just ask Sam. Thank you all very much. In      I had maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life. I was in the third year of my seven year undergraduate degree. I took a couple victory laps in there. And I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California  and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus  and we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains. And there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise  and as we sat there  over the mountains coming in from the north were these Steven Spielbergian clouds rolling toward us  and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley  so help me God  every single animal in that place stopped making noise at the same time. And then the clouds came over us  and then  boom  This massive thunderclap  and sheets of rain. It was just extraordinary  and when I came back home I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz  and decided to set it to music  a piece for choir called  Cloudburst   which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment. Now fast forward to just three years ago. the Virtual Choir Project      singers from    different countries. You can see my little video there conducting these people  alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home. Two years ago  on this very stage  we premiered Virtual Choir          singers from    different countries  this time performing a piece that I had written called  Sleep.  And then just last spring we released Virtual Choir     Water Night   another piece that I had written  this time nearly       singers from    different countries. And when I was speaking to Chris about the future of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this  he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could. Could we do this all in real time  Could we have people singing together in real time  And with the help of Skype  that is what we are going to attempt today. Now  we'll perform  Cloudburst  for you. The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage. I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach  Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College  some of the best amateur choirs in the country  and   and in the second half of the piece  the virtual choir will join us     different singers from    different countries. Now  we've pushed the technology as far as it can go  but there's still less than a second of latency  but in musical terms  that's a lifetime. We deal in milliseconds. So what I've done is  I've adapted  Cloudburst  so that it embraces the latency and the performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together. So with deep humility  and for your approval  we present  Cloudburst.   The rain ...   Eyes of shadow water   eyes of well water   eyes of dream water.   Blue suns  green whirlwinds    birdbeaks of light pecking open   pomegranate stars.   But tell me  burnt earth  is there no water    Only blood  only dust    only naked footsteps on the thorns    The rain awakens...   We must sleep with open eyes    we must dream with our hands    we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course    of the sun dreaming its worlds.   We must dream aloud    we must sing till the song puts forth roots    trunk  branches  birds  stars.   We must find the lost word    and remember what the blood    the tides  the earth  and the body say    and return to the point of departure...    Cloudburst  Octavio Paz  translation by Lysander Kemp  adapted by Eric Whitacre  Eric Whitacre  Beth. Annabelle  where are you  Jacob. Thank you. Everything is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms  bacteria  viruses and fungi. Our desks  our computers  our pencils  our buildings all harbor resident microbial landscapes. As we design these things  we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds  and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems. Our bodies are home to trillions of microbes  and these creatures define who we are. The microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods. The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system. The microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath  or not  and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch. So  for example  when you touch a pencil  microbial exchange happens. If we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings  this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways. I get asked all of the time from people   Is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems   And I believe the answer is yes. I think we're doing it right now  but we're doing it unconsciously. I'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture that demonstrates how  through both conscious and unconscious design  we're impacting these invisible worlds. This is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon  and I worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over     rooms in this building. We wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building  and to do this  we sampled dust. From the dust  we pulled out bacterial cells  broke them open  and compared their gene sequences. This means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project. This is a picture of Tim  who  right when I snapped this picture  reminded me  he said   Jessica  the last lab group I worked in I was doing fieldwork in the Costa Rican rainforest  and things have changed dramatically for me.  So I'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices  and we're going to look at the data through a visualization tool that I've been working on in partnership with Autodesk. The way that you look at this data is  first  look around the outside of the circle. You'll see broad bacterial groups  and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe  it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group. So at    o'clock  you'll see that offices have a lot of alphaproteobacteria  and at one o'clock you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare. Let's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building. If you look inside the restrooms  they all have really similar ecosystems  and if you were to look inside the classrooms  those also have similar ecosystems. But if you look across these space types  you can see that they're fundamentally different from one another. I like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest. I told Tim   If you could just see the microbes  it's kind of like being in Costa Rica. Kind of.  And I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland. This perspective is a really powerful one for designers  because you can bring on principles of ecology  and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal  the way organisms move around. We know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air. So the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system. Mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable  that the air flow and temperature is just right. They do this using principles of physics and chemistry  but they could also be using biology. If you look at the microbes in one of the air handling units in this building  you'll see that they're all very similar to one another. And if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit  you'll see that they're fundamentally different. The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago  and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco engineers  and they have the ability to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to. Another facet of how microbes get around is by people  and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people  or the sharing of ideas  like in labs and in offices. Given that microbes travel around with people  you might expect to see rooms that are close together have really similar biomes. And that is exactly what we found. If you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another  they have very similar ecosystems  but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away  the ecosystem is fundamentally different. And when I see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns  it makes me think that it's possible to tackle really challenging problems  like hospital acquired infections. I believe this has got to be  in part  a building ecology problem. All right  I'm going to tell you one more story about this building. I am collaborating with Charlie Brown. He's an architect  and Charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change. He's dedicated his life to sustainable design. When he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building  he got really excited  because it added a new dimension to what he did. He went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health. He helped design some of the air handling systems in this building and the way it was ventilated. So what I'm first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building. What you're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities in the outdoor air  and how they vary over time. Next I'm going to show you what happened when we experimentally manipulated classrooms. We blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation. A lot of buildings are operated this way  probably where you work  and companies do this to save money on their energy bill. What we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until Saturday  when we opened the vents up again. When you walked into those rooms  they smelled really bad  and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before. Contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air came in from the outside through louvers. In these rooms  the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well  and when Charlie saw this  he got really excited. He felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape. The examples that I just gave you are about architecture  but they're relevant to the design of anything. Imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane or on a phone. There's a new microbe  I just discovered it. It's called BLIS  and it's been shown to both ward off pathogens and give you good breath. Wouldn't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones  A conscious approach to design  I'm calling it bioinformed design  and I think it's possible. Thank you. I'm here to show you how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at. You're about to experience a new  available and exciting technology that's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives. What I have here is a cinder block that we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material. It's called Ultra Ever Dry  and when you apply it to any material  it turns into a superhydrophobic shield. So this is a cinder block  uncoated  and you can see that it's porous  it absorbs water. Not anymore. Porous  nonporous. So what's superhydrophobic  Superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface. The rounder it is  the more hydrophobic it is  and if it's really round  it's superhydrophobic. A freshly waxed car  the water molecules slump to about    degrees. A windshield coating is going to give you about     degrees. But what you're seeing here is     to     degrees  and anything over     is superhydrophobic. So as part of the demonstration  what I have is a pair of gloves  and we've coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating  and let's see if you can tell which one  and I'll give you a hint. Did you guess the one that was dry  When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience  what's occurred is that we're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits. And we're talking really small here. The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers  and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter  and to put some scale to that  if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick  and you put it side by side  and you had        of them  you'd be the width of a human hair. So very small  but very useful. And it's not just water that this works with. It's a lot of water based materials like concrete  water based paint  mud  and also some refined oils as well. You can see the difference. Moving onto the next demonstration  we've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it  we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating  and we're going to pour this green tinted water inside the middle  and you're going to see  it's going to spread out on glass like you'd normally think it would  except when it hits the coating  it stops  and I can't even coax it to leave. It's that afraid of the water. So what's going on here  What's happening  Well  the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface. You'd think it'd be smooth  but it's actually not. And it has billions of interstitial spaces  and those spaces  along with the nanoparticles  reach up and grab the air molecules  and cover the surface with air. It's an umbrella of air all across it  and that layer of air is what the water hits  the mud hits  the concrete hits  and it glides right off. So if I put this inside this water here  you can see a silver reflective coating around it  and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that's protecting the water from touching the paddle  and it's dry. So what are the applications  I mean  many of you right now are probably going through your head. Everyone that sees this gets excited  and says   Oh  I could use it for this and this and this.  The applications in a general sense could be anything that's anti wetting. We've certainly seen that today. It could be anything that's anti icing  because if you don't have water  you don't have ice. It could be anti corrosion. No water  no corrosion. It could be anti bacterial. Without water  the bacteria won't survive. And it could be things that need to be self cleaning as well. So imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work. And I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration  but before I do that  I would like to say thank you  and think small. It's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it. Chris Anderson  You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the Design from TED   Laughter   Two minutes later...  He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part. It's happening  This is where I live. I live in Kenya  at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park. Those are my dad's cows at the back  and behind the cows  that's the Nairobi National Park. Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely  which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely. So predators like lions follow them  and this is what they do. They kill our livestock. This is one of the cows which was killed at night  and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead  and I felt so bad  because it was the only bull we had. My community  the Maasai  we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them  and that's why we value them so much. So I grew up hating lions so much. The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock  and they're also upset about this problem. So they kill the lions. It's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi. And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few. So a boy  from six to nine years old  in my community is responsible for his dad's cows  and that's the same thing which happened to me. So I had to find a way of solving this problem. And the first idea I got was to use fire  because I thought lions were scared of fire. But I came to realize that that didn't really help  because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed. So I didn't give up. I continued. And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow. I was trying to trick the lions  into thinking  that I was standing near the cowshed. But lions are very clever.  Laughter  They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow  and they go back  but the second day  they'll come and they say  this thing is not moving here  it's always here.  Laughter  So he jumps in and kills the animals. So one night  I was walking around the cowshed with a torch  and that day  the lions didn't come. And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light. So I had an idea. Since I was a small boy  I used to work in my room for the whole day  and I even took apart my mom's new radio  and that day she almost killed me  but I learned a lot about electronics.  Laughter  So I got an old car battery  an indicator box. It's a small device found in a motorcycle  and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left. It blinks. And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights  on and off. And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight. So I set up everything. As you can see  the solar panel charges the battery  and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box. I call it a transformer. And the indicator box makes the lights flash. As you can see  the bulbs face outside  because that's where the lions come from. And that's how it looks to lions when they come at night. The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed  but I was sleeping in my bed. Thanks. So I set it up in my home two years ago  and since then  we have never experienced any problem with lions. And my neighboring homes heard about this idea. One of them was this grandmother. She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions  and she asked me if I could put the lights for her. And I said   Yes.  So I put the lights. You can see at the back  those are the lion lights. Since now  I've set up seven homes around my community  and they're really working. And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas  leopards  and it's also being used to scare elephants away from people's farms. Because of this invention  I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya  Brookhouse International School  and I'm really excited about this. My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness. I even took my friends back to my community  and we're installing the lights to the homes which don't have  any   and I'm teaching them how to put them. So one year ago  I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father's cows  and I used to see planes flying over  and I told myself that one day  I'll be there inside. And here I am today. I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED. So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up. I used to hate lions  but now because my invention is saving my father's cows and the lions  we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict. Ash  ol n. It means in my language  thank you very much. Chris Anderson  You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours. So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere  Yep. CA  You're working on other electrical inventions. What's the next one on your list  RT  My next invention is  I want to make an electric fence.CA  Electric fence  RT  But I know electric fences are already invented  but I want to make mine. CA  You already tried it once  right  and you   RT  I tried it before  but I stopped because it gave me a shock.  Laughter  CA  In the trenches. Richard Turere  you are something else. We're going to cheer you on every step of the way  my friend. Thank you so much.RT  Thank you.  Applause  I'm going to talk about the strategizing brain. We're going to use an unusual combination of tools from game theory and neuroscience to understand how people interact socially when value is on the line. So game theory is a branch of  originally  applied mathematics  used mostly in economics and political science  a little bit in biology  that gives us a mathematical taxonomy of social life and it predicts what people are likely to do and believe others will do in cases where everyone's actions affect everyone else. That's a lot of things  competition  cooperation  bargaining  games like hide and seek  and poker. Here's a simple game to get us started. Everyone chooses a number from zero to      we're going to compute the average of those numbers  and whoever's closest to two thirds of the average wins a fixed prize. So you want to be a little bit below the average number  but not too far below  and everyone else wants to be a little bit below the average number as well. Think about what you might pick. As you're thinking  this is a toy model of something like selling in the stock market during a rising market. Right  You don't want to sell too early  because you miss out on profits  but you don't want to wait too late to when everyone else sells  triggering a crash. You want to be a little bit ahead of the competition  but not too far ahead. Okay  here's two theories about how people might think about this  and then we'll see some data. Some of these will sound familiar because you probably are thinking that way. I'm using my brain theory to see. A lot of people say   I really don't know what people are going to pick  so I think the average will be   .  They're not being really strategic at all.  And I'll pick two thirds of   . That's   .  That's a start. Other people who are a little more sophisticated  using more working memory  say   I think people will pick    because they're going to pick a response to     and so I'll pick     which is two thirds of   .  They're doing one extra step of thinking  two steps. That's better. And of course  in principle  you could do three  four or more  but it starts to get very difficult. Just like in language and other domains  we know that it's hard for people to parse very complex sentences with a kind of recursive structure. This is called a cognitive hierarchy theory  by the way. It's something that I've worked on and a few other people  and it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with some assumptions about how many people stop at different steps and how the steps of thinking are affected by lots of interesting variables and variant people  as we'll see in a minute. A very different theory  a much more popular one  and an older one  due largely to John Nash of  A Beautiful Mind  fame  is what's called equilibrium analysis. So if you've ever taken a game theory course at any level  you will have learned a little bit about this. An equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody has figured out exactly what everyone else will do. It is a very useful concept  but behaviorally  it may not exactly explain what people do the first time they play these types of economic games or in situations in the outside world. In this case  the equilibrium makes a very bold prediction  which is everyone wants to be below everyone else  therefore they'll play zero. Let's see what happens. This experiment's been done many  many times. Some of the earliest ones were done in the '  s by me and Rosemarie Nagel and others. This is a beautiful data set of       people who wrote in to three newspapers and magazines that had a contest. The contest said  send in your numbers and whoever is close to two thirds of the average will win a big prize. And as you can see  there's so much data here  you can see the spikes very visibly. There's a spike at   . Those are people doing one step. There is another spike visible at   . And notice  by the way  that most people pick numbers right around there. They don't necessarily pick exactly    and   . There's something a little bit noisy around it. But you can see those spikes  and they're there. There's another group of people who seem to have a firm grip on equilibrium analysis  because they're picking zero or one. But they lose  right  Because picking a number that low is actually a bad choice if other people aren't doing equilibrium analysis as well. So they're smart  but poor. Where are these things happening in the brain  One study by Coricelli and Nagel gives a really sharp  interesting answer. So they had people play this game while they were being scanned in an fMRI  and two conditions  in some trials  they're told you're playing another person who's playing right now and we're going to match up your behavior at the end and pay you if you win. In the other trials  they're told  you're playing a computer. They're just choosing randomly. So what you see here is a subtraction of areas in which there's more brain activity when you're playing people compared to playing the computer. And you see activity in some regions we've seen today  medial prefrontal cortex  dorsomedial  however  up here  ventromedial prefrontal cortex  anterior cingulate  an area that's involved in lots of types of conflict resolution  like if you're playing  Simon Says   and also the right and left temporoparietal junction. And these are all areas which are fairly reliably known to be part of what's called a  theory of mind  circuit  or  mentalizing circuit.  That is  it's a circuit that's used to imagine what other people might do. So these were some of the first studies to see this tied in to game theory. What happens with these one  and two step types  So we classify people by what they picked  and then we look at the difference between playing humans versus playing computers  which brain areas are differentially active. On the top you see the one step players. There's almost no difference. The reason is  they're treating other people like a computer  and the brain is too. The bottom players  you see all the activity in dorsomedial PFC. So we know that those two step players are doing something differently. Now if you were to step back and say   What can we do with this information   you might be able to look at brain activity and say   This person's going to be a good poker player   or   This person's socially naive   and we might also be able to study things like development of adolescent brains once we have an idea of where this circuitry exists. Okay. Get ready. I'm saving you some brain activity  because you don't need to use your hair detector cells. You should use those cells to think carefully about this game. This is a bargaining game. Two players who are being scanned using EEG electrodes are going to bargain over one to six dollars. If they can do it in    seconds  they're going to actually earn that money. If    seconds goes by and they haven't made a deal  they get nothing. That's kind of a mistake together. The twist is that one player  on the left  is informed about how much on each trial there is. They play lots of trials with different amounts each time. In this case  they know there's four dollars. The uninformed player doesn't know  but they know that the informed player knows. So the uninformed player's challenge is to say   Is this guy really being fair or are they giving me a very low offer in order to get me to think that there's only one or two dollars available to split   in which case they might reject it and not come to a deal. So there's some tension here between trying to get the most money but trying to goad the other player into giving you more. And the way they bargain is to point on a number line that goes from zero to six dollars  and they're bargaining over how much the uninformed player gets  and the informed player's going to get the rest. So this is like a management labor negotiation in which the workers don't know how much profits the privately held company has  right  and they want to maybe hold out for more money  but the company might want to create the impression that there's very little to split   I'm giving you the most that I can.  First some behavior. So a bunch of the subject pairs  they play face to face. We have some other data where they play across computers. That's an interesting difference  as you might imagine. But a bunch of the face to face pairs agree to divide the money evenly every single time. Boring. It's just not interesting neurally. It's good for them. They make a lot of money. But we're interested in  can we say something about when disagreements occur versus don't occur  So this is the other group of subjects who often disagree. So they have a chance of    they bicker and disagree and end up with less money. They might be eligible to be on  Real Housewives   the TV show. You see on the left  when the amount to divide is one  two or three dollars  they disagree about half the time  and when the amount is four  five  six  they agree quite often. This turns out to be something that's predicted by a very complicated type of game theory you should come to graduate school at CalTech and learn about. It's a little too complicated to explain right now  but the theory tells you that this shape kind of should occur. Your intuition might tell you that too. Now I'm going to show you the results from the EEG recording. Very complicated. The right brain schematic is the uninformed person  and the left is the informed. Remember that we scanned both brains at the same time  so we can ask about time synced activity in similar or different areas simultaneously  just like if you wanted to study a conversation and you were scanning two people talking to each other and you'd expect common activity in language regions when they're actually kind of listening and communicating. So the arrows connect regions that are active at the same time  and the direction of the arrows flows from the region that's active first in time  and the arrowhead goes to the region that's active later. So in this case  if you look carefully  most of the arrows flow from right to left. That is  it looks as if the uninformed brain activity is happening first  and then it's followed by activity in the informed brain. And by the way  these were trials where their deals were made. This is from the first two seconds. We haven't finished analyzing this data  so we're still peeking in  but the hope is that we can say something in the first couple of seconds about whether they'll make a deal or not  which could be very useful in thinking about avoiding litigation and ugly divorces and things like that. Those are all cases in which a lot of value is lost by delay and strikes. Here's the case where the disagreements occur. You can see it looks different than the one before. There's a lot more arrows. That means that the brains are synced up more closely in terms of simultaneous activity  and the arrows flow clearly from left to right. That is  the informed brain seems to be deciding   We're probably not going to make a deal here.  And then later there's activity in the uninformed brain. Next I'm going to introduce you to some relatives. They're hairy  smelly  fast and strong. You might be thinking back to your last Thanksgiving. Maybe if you had a chimpanzee with you. Charles Darwin and I and you broke off from the family tree from chimpanzees about five million years ago. They're still our closest genetic kin. We share   .  percent of the genes. We share more genes with them than zebras do with horses. And we're also their closest cousin. They have more genetic relation to us than to gorillas. So how humans and chimpanzees behave differently might tell us a lot about brain evolution. So this is an amazing memory test from Nagoya  Japan  Primate Research Institute  where they've done a lot of this research. This goes back quite a ways. They're interested in working memory. The chimp is going to see  watch carefully  they're going to see     milliseconds' exposure   that's fast  that's eight movie frames   of numbers one  two  three  four  five. Then they disappear and they're replaced by squares  and they have to press the squares that correspond to the numbers from low to high to get an apple reward. Let's see how they can do it. This is a young chimp. The young ones are better than the old ones  just like humans. And they're highly experienced  so they've done this thousands and thousands of time. Obviously there's a big training effect  as you can imagine. You can see they're very blas  and kind of effortless. Not only can they do it very well  they do it in a sort of lazy way. Right  Who thinks you could beat the chimps  Wrong.  Laughter  We can try. We'll try. Maybe we'll try. Okay  so the next part of this study I'm going to go quickly through is based on an idea of Tetsuro Matsuzawa. He had a bold idea that    what he called the cognitive trade off hypothesis. We know chimps are faster and stronger. They're also very obsessed with status. His thought was  maybe they've preserved brain activities and they practice them in development that are really  really important to them to negotiate status and to win  which is something like strategic thinking during competition. So we're going to check that out by having the chimps actually play a game by touching two touch screens. The chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers. They're going to press left or right. One chimp is called a matcher. They win if they press left  left  like a seeker finding someone in hide and seek  or right  right. The mismatcher wants to mismatch. They want to press the opposite screen of the chimp. And the rewards are apple cube rewards. So here's how game theorists look at these data. This is a graph of the percentage of times the matcher picked right on the x axis  and the percentage of times they predicted right by the mismatcher on the y axis. So a point here is the behavior by a pair of players  one trying to match  one trying to mismatch. The NE square in the middle    actually NE  CH and QRE    those are three different theories of Nash equilibrium  and others  tells you what the theory predicts  which is that they should match        because if you play left too much  for example  I can exploit that if I'm the mismatcher by then playing right. And as you can see  the chimps  each chimp is one triangle  are circled around  hovering around that prediction. Now we move the payoffs. We're actually going to make the left  left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher. Now they get three apple cubes. Game theoretically  that should actually make the mismatcher's behavior shift  because what happens is  the mismatcher will think  oh  this guy's going to go for the big reward  and so I'm going to go to the right  make sure he doesn't get it. And as you can see  their behavior moves up in the direction of this change in the Nash equilibrium. Finally  we changed the payoffs one more time. Now it's four apple cubes  and their behavior again moves towards the Nash equilibrium. It's sprinkled around  but if you average the chimps out  they're really  really close  within .  . They're actually closer than any species we've observed. What about humans  You think you're smarter than a chimpanzee  Here's two human groups in green and blue. They're closer to      . They're not responding to payoffs as closely  and also if you study their learning in the game  they aren't as sensitive to previous rewards. The chimps are playing better than the humans  better in the sense of adhering to game theory. And these are two different groups of humans from Japan and Africa. They replicate quite nicely. None of them are close to where the chimps are. So here are some things we learned today. People seem to do a limited amount of strategic thinking using theory of mind. We have some preliminary evidence from bargaining that early warning signs in the brain might be used to predict whether there will be a bad disagreement that costs money  and chimps are better competitors than humans  as judged by game theory. Thank you. This is the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam  where I work as a curator. It's my job to make sure the collection stays okay  and that it grows  and basically it means I collect dead animals. Back in       we got a new wing next to the museum. It was made of glass  and this building really helped me to do my job good. The building was a true bird killer. You may know that birds don't understand the concept of glass. They don't see it  so they fly into the windows and get killed. The only thing I had to do was go out  pick them up  and have them stuffed for the collection. And in those days  I developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass. And it was on June          that I heard a loud bang against the glass that changed my life and ended that of a duck. And this is what I saw when I looked out of the window. This is the dead duck. It flew against the window. It's laying dead on its belly. But next to the dead duck is a live duck  and please pay attention. Both are of the male sex. And then this happened. The live duck mounted the dead duck  and started to copulate. Well  I'm a biologist. I'm an ornithologist. I said   Something's wrong here.  One is dead  one is alive. That must be necrophilia. I look. Both are of the male sex. Homosexual necrophilia. So I     Laughter  I took my camera  I took my notebook  took a chair  and started to observe this behavior. After    minutes    Laughter    I had seen enough  and I got hungry  and I wanted to go home. So I went out  collected the duck  and before I put it in the freezer  I checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex. And here's a rare picture of a duck's penis  so it was indeed of the male sex. It's a rare picture because there are        species of birds and only     possess a penis.  The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard Anas platyrhynchos  Aves Anatidae   I knew I'd seen something special  but it took me six years to decide to publish it. I mean  it's a nice topic for a birthday party or at the coffee machine  but to share this among your peers is something different. I didn't have the framework. So after six years  my friends and colleagues urged me to publish  so I published  The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard.  And here's the situation again. A is my office  B is the place where the duck hit the glass  and C is from where I watched it. And here are the ducks again. As you probably know  in science  when you write a kind of special paper  only six or seven people read it. But then something good happened. I got a phone call from a person called Marc Abrahams  and he told me   You've won a prize with your duck paper  the Ig Nobel Prize.  And the Ig Nobel Prize   the Ig Nobel Prize honors research that first makes people laugh  and then makes them think  with the ultimate goal to make more people interested in science. That's a good thing  so I accepted the prize. I went    let me remind you that Marc Abrahams didn't call me from Stockholm. He called me from Cambridge  Massachusetts. So I traveled to Boston  to Cambridge  and I went to this wonderful Ig Nobel Prize ceremony held at Harvard University  and this ceremony is a very nice experience. Real Nobel laureates hand you the prize. That's the first thing. And there are nine other winners who get prizes. Here's one of my fellow winners. That's Charles Paxton who won the      biology prize for his paper   Courtship behavior of ostriches towards humans under farming conditions in Britain.  And I think there are one or two more Ig Nobel Prize winners in this room. Dan  where are you  Dan Ariely  Applause for Dan. Dan won his prize in medicine for demonstrating that high priced fake medicine works better than low priced fake medicine. So here's my one minute of fame  my acceptance speech  and here's the duck. This is its first time on the U.S. West Coast. I'm going to pass it around. Yeah  You can pass it around. Please note it's a museum specimen  but there's no chance you'll get the avian flu. After winning this prize  my life changed. In the first place  people started to send me all kinds of duck related things  and I got a real nice collection. More importantly  people started to send me their observations of remarkable animal behavior  and believe me  if there's an animal misbehaving on this planet  I know about it. This is a moose. It's a moose trying to copulate with a bronze statue of a bison. This is in Montana      . This is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish. This is the Netherlands      . These are cane toads in Australia. This is roadkill. Please note that this is necrophilia. It's remarkable  the position. The missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom. These are pigeons in Rotterdam. Barn swallows in Hong Kong      . This is a turkey in Wisconsin on the premises of the Ethan Allen juvenile correctional institution. It took all day  and the prisoners had a great time. So what does this mean  I mean  the question I ask myself  why does this happen in nature  Well  what I concluded from reviewing all these cases is that it is important that this happens only when death is instant and in a dramatic way and in the right position for copulation. At least  I thought it was till I got these slides. And here you see a dead duck. It's been there for three days  and it's laying on its back. So there goes my theory of necrophilia. Another example of the impact of glass buildings on the life of birds. This is Mad Max  a blackbird who lives in Rotterdam. The only thing this bird did was fly against this window from      to       day in and day out. Here he goes  and here's a short video. So what this bird does is fight his own image. He sees an intruder in his territory  and it's coming all the time and he's there  so there is no end to it. And I thought  in the beginning    I studied this bird for a couple of years    that  well  shouldn't the brain of this bird be damaged  It's not. I show you here some slides  some frames from the video  and at the last moment before he hits the glass  he puts his feet in front  and then he bangs against the glass. So I'll conclude to invite you all to Dead Duck Day. That's on June   every year. At five minutes to six in the afternoon  we come together at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam  the duck comes out of the museum  and we try to discuss new ways to prevent birds from colliding with windows. And as you know  or as you may not know  this is one of the major causes of death for birds in the world. In the U.S. alone  a billion birds die in collision with glass buildings. And when it's over  we go to a Chinese restaurant and we have a six course duck dinner. So I hope to see you next year in Rotterdam  the Netherlands  for Dead Duck Day. Thank you. Oh  sorry. May I have my duck back  please  Thank you. Today I'm going to show you an electric vehicle that weighs less than a bicycle  that you can carry with you anywhere  that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in    minutes  and you can run it for       kilometers on about a dollar of electricity. But when I say the word electric vehicle  people think about vehicles. They think about cars and motorcycles and bicycles  and the vehicles that you use every day. But if you come about it from a different perspective  you can create some more interesting  more novel concepts. So we built something. I've got some of the pieces in my pocket here. So this is the motor. This motor has enough power to take you up the hills of San Francisco at about    miles per hour  about    kilometers an hour  and this battery  this battery right here has about six miles of range  or    kilometers  which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the U.S. alone. But the best part about these components is that we bought them at a toy store. These are from remote control airplanes. And the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently  you can really change things. So today we're going to show you one example of how you can use this. Pay attention to not only how fun this thing is  but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco.    Mile Range   Top Speed Near   mph   Uphill Climbing   Regenerative Braking  So we're going to show you what this thing can do. It's really maneuverable. You have a hand held remote  so you can pretty easily control acceleration  braking  go in reverse if you like  also have braking. It's incredible just how light this thing is. I mean  this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go. So I'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles. This uses    times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car  which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build  but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use in terms of your transportation. So instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed for each person in this room to get around in a city  now you can look at much smaller amounts and more sustainable transportation. So next time you think about a vehicle  I hope  like us  you're thinking about something new. Thank you. Once upon a time  there was a place called Lesterland. Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States. Like the United States  it has about     million people  and of that     million people  it turns out         are called Lester. If Matt's in the audience  I just borrowed that  I'll return it in a second  this character from your series. So         are called Lester  which means about .   percent is named Lester. Now  Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power. There are two elections every election cycle in Lesterland. One is called the general election. The other is called the Lester election. And in the general election  it's the citizens who get to vote  but in the Lester election  it's the Lesters who get to vote. And here's the trick. In order to run in the general election  you must do extremely well in the Lester election. You don't necessarily have to win  but you must do extremely well. Now  what can we say about democracy in Lesterland  What we can say  number one  as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United  that people have the ultimate influence over elected officials  because  after all  there is a general election  but only after the Lesters have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in the general election. And number two  obviously  this dependence upon the Lesters is going to produce a subtle  understated  we could say camouflaged  bending to keep the Lesters happy. Okay  so we have a democracy  no doubt  but it's dependent upon the Lesters and dependent upon the people. It has competing dependencies  we could say conflicting dependencies  depending upon who the Lesters are. Okay. That's Lesterland. Now there are three things I want you to see now that I've described Lesterland. Number one  the United States is Lesterland. The United States is Lesterland. The United States also looks like this  also has two elections  one we called the general election  the second we should call the money election. In the general election  it's the citizens who get to vote  if you're over     in some states if you have an ID. In the money election  it's the funders who get to vote  the funders who get to vote  and just like in Lesterland  the trick is  to run in the general election  you must do extremely well in the money election. You don't necessarily have to win. There is Jerry Brown. But you must do extremely well. And here's the key  There are just as few relevant funders in USA land as there are Lesters in Lesterland. Now you say  really  Really .   percent  Well  here are the numbers from       .   percent of America gave     dollars or more to any federal candidate  .   percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate  .   percent    the one percent of the one percent    gave        dollars or more to federal candidates  and in this election cycle  my favorite statistic is .       percent   for those of you doing the numbers  you know that's     Americans   gave    percent of the Super PAC money spent in the cycle we have just seen ending. So I'm just a lawyer  I look at this range of numbers  and I say it's fair for me to say it's .   percent who are our relevant funders in America. In this sense  the funders are our Lesters. Now  what can we say about this democracy in USA land  Well  as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United  we could say  of course the people have the ultimate influence over the elected officials. We have a general election  but only after the funders have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in that general election. And number two  obviously  this dependence upon the funders produces a subtle  understated  camouflaged bending to keep the funders happy. Candidates for Congress and members of Congress spend between    and    percent of their time raising money to get back to Congress or to get their party back into power  and the question we need to ask is  what does it do to them  these humans  as they spend their time behind the telephone  calling people they've never met  but calling the tiniest slice of the one percent  As anyone would  as they do this  they develop a sixth sense  a constant awareness about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money. They become  in the words of  The X Files   shape shifters  as they constantly adjust their views in light of what they know will help them to raise money  not on issues one to     but on issues    to      . Leslie Byrne  a Democrat from Virginia  describes that when she went to Congress  she was told by a colleague   Always lean to the green.  Then to clarify  she went on   He was not an environmentalist.   Laughter  So here too we have a democracy  a democracy dependent upon the funders and dependent upon the people  competing dependencies  possibly conflicting dependencies depending upon who the funders are. Okay  the United States is Lesterland  point number one. Here's point number two. The United States is worse than Lesterland  worse than Lesterland because you can imagine in Lesterland if we Lesters got a letter from the government that said   Hey  you get to pick who gets to run in the general election   we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of Lesters. You know  there are Lesters from every part of social society. There are rich Lesters  poor Lesters  black Lesters  white Lesters  not many women Lesters  but put that to the side for one second. We have Lesters from everywhere. We could think   What could we do to make Lesterland better   It's at least possible the Lesters would act for the good of Lesterland. But in our land  in this land  in USA land  there are certainly some sweet Lesters out there  many of them in this room here today  but the vast majority of Lesters act for the Lesters  because the shifting coalitions that are comprising the .   percent are not comprising it for the public interest. It's for their private interest. In this sense  the USA is worse than Lesterland. And finally  point number three  Whatever one wants to say about Lesterland  against the background of its history  its traditions  in our land  in USA land  Lesterland is a corruption  a corruption. Now  by corruption I don't mean brown paper bag cash secreted among members of Congress. I don't mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption. I don't mean any criminal act. The corruption I'm talking about is perfectly legal. It's a corruption relative to the framers' baseline for this republic. The framers gave us what they called a republic  but by a republic they meant a representative democracy  and by a representative democracy  they meant a government  as Madison put it in Federalist     that would have a branch that would be dependent upon the people alone. So here's the model of government. They have the people and the government with this exclusive dependency  but the problem here is that Congress has evolved a different dependence  no longer a dependence upon the people alone  increasingly a dependence upon the funders. Now this is a dependence too  but it's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone so long as the funders are not the people. This is a corruption. Now  there's good news and bad news about this corruption. One bit of good news is that it's bipartisan  equal opportunity corruption. It blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about. It blocks the right too  as it makes principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible. So the right wants smaller government. When Al Gore was Vice President  his team had an idea for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry. The chief policy man took this idea to Capitol Hill  and as he reported back to me  the response was   Hell no  If we deregulate these guys  how are we going to raise money from them   This is a system that's designed to save the status quo  including the status quo of big and invasive government. It works against the left and the right  and that  you might say  is good news. But here's the bad news. It's a pathological  democracy destroying corruption  because in any system where the members are dependent upon the tiniest fraction of us for their election  that means the tiniest number of us  the tiniest  tiniest number of us  can block reform. I know that should have been  like  a rock or something. I can only find cheese. I'm sorry. So there it is. Block reform. Because there is an economy here  an economy of influence  an economy with lobbyists at the center which feeds on polarization. It feeds on dysfunction. The worse that it is for us  the better that it is for this fundraising. Henry David Thoreau   There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root.  This is the root. Okay  now  every single one of you knows this. You couldn't be here if you didn't know this  yet you ignore it. You ignore it. This is an impossible problem. You focus on the possible problems  like eradicating polio from the world  or taking an image of every single street across the globe  or building the first real universal translator  or building a fusion factory in your garage. These are the manageable problems  so you ignore   so you ignore this corruption. But we cannot ignore this corruption anymore. We need a government that works. And not works for the left or the right  but works for the left and the right  the citizens of the left and right  because there is no sensible reform possible until we end this corruption. So I want you to take hold  to grab the issue you care the most about. Climate change is mine  but it might be financial reform or a simpler tax system or inequality. Grab that issue  sit it down in front of you  look straight in its eyes  and tell it there is no Christmas this year. There will never be a Christmas. We will never get your issue solved until we fix this issue first. So it's not that mine is the most important issue. It's not. Yours is the most important issue  but mine is the first issue  the issue we have to solve before we get to fix the issues you care about. No sensible reform  and we cannot afford a world  a future  with no sensible reform. Okay. So how do we do it  Turns out  the analytics here are easy  simple. If the problem is members spending an extraordinary amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of America  the solution is to have them spend less time fundraising but fundraise from a wider slice of Americans  to spread it out  to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea of dependence upon the people alone. And to do this does not require a constitutional amendment  changing the First Amendment. To do this would require a single statute  a statute establishing what we think of as small dollar funded elections  a statute of citizen funded campaigns  and there's any number of these proposals out there  Fair Elections Now Act  the American Anti Corruption Act  an idea in my book that I call the Grant and Franklin Project to give vouchers to people to fund elections  an idea of John Sarbanes called the Grassroots Democracy Act. Each of these would fix this corruption by spreading out the influence of funders to all of us. The analytics are easy here. It's the politics that's hard  indeed impossibly hard  because this reform would shrink K Street  and Capitol Hill  as Congressman Jim Cooper  a Democrat from Tennessee  put it  has become a farm league for K Street  a farm league for K Street. Members and staffers and bureaucrats have an increasingly common business model in their head  a business model focused on their life after government  their life as lobbyists. Fifty percent of the Senate between      and      left to become lobbyists     percent of the House. Those numbers have only gone up  and as United Republic calculated last April  the average increase in salary for those who they tracked was       percent. So it's fair to ask  how is it possible for them to change this  Now I get this skepticism. I get this cynicism. I get this sense of impossibility. But I don't buy it. This is a solvable issue. If you think about the issues our parents tried to solve in the   th century  issues like racism  or sexism  or the issue that we've been fighting in this century  homophobia  those are hard issues. You don't wake up one day no longer a racist. It takes generations to tear that intuition  that DNA  out of the soul of a people. But this is a problem of just incentives  just incentives. Change the incentives  and the behavior changes  and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems have seen overnight a change in the practice. When Connecticut adopted this system  in the very first year     percent of elected representatives gave up large contributions and took small contributions only. It's solvable  not by being a Democrat  not by being a Republican. It's solvable by being citizens  by being citizens  by being TEDizens. Because if you want to kickstart reform  look  I could kickstart reform at half the price of fixing energy policy  I could give you back a republic. Okay. But even if you're not yet with me  even if you believe this is impossible  what the five years since I spoke at TED has taught me as I've spoken about this issue again and again is  even if you think it's impossible  that is irrelevant. Irrelevant. I spoke at Dartmouth once  and a woman stood up after I spoke  I write in my book  and she said to me   Professor  you've convinced me this is hopeless. Hopeless. There's nothing we can do.  When she said that  I scrambled. I tried to think   How do I respond to that hopelessness  What is that sense of hopelessness   And what hit me was an image of my six year old son. And I imagined a doctor coming to me and saying   Your son has terminal brain cancer  and there's nothing you can do. Nothing you can do.  So would I do nothing  Would I just sit there  Accept it  Okay  nothing I can do  I'm going off to build Google Glass. Of course not. I would do everything I could  and I would do everything I could because this is what love means  that the odds are irrelevant and that you do whatever the hell you can  the odds be damned. And then I saw the obvious link  because even we liberals love this country. And so when the pundits and the politicians say that change is impossible  what this love of country says back is   That's just irrelevant.  We lose something dear  something everyone in this room loves and cherishes  if we lose this republic  and so we act with everything we can to prove these pundits wrong. So here's my question  Do you have that love  Do you have that love  Because if you do  then what the hell are you  what are the hell are we doing  When Ben Franklin was carried from the constitutional convention in September of       he was stopped in the street by a woman who said   Mr. Franklin  what have you wrought   Franklin said   A republic  madam  if you can keep it.  A republic. A representative democracy. A government dependent upon the people alone. We have lost that republic. All of us have to act to get it back. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  This is me building a prototype for six hours straight. This is slave labor to my own project. This is what the DIY and maker movements really look like. And this is an analogy for today's construction and manufacturing world with brute force assembly techniques. And this is exactly why I started studying how to program physical materials to build themselves. But there is another world. Today at the micro  and nanoscales  there's an unprecedented revolution happening. And this is the ability to program physical and biological materials to change shape  change properties and even compute outside of silicon based matter. There's even a software called cadnano that allows us to design three dimensional shapes like nano robots or drug delivery systems and use DNA to self assemble those functional structures. But if we look at the human scale  there's massive problems that aren't being addressed by those nanoscale technologies. If we look at construction and manufacturing  there's major inefficiencies  energy consumption and excessive labor techniques. In infrastructure  let's just take one example. Take piping. In water pipes  we have fixed capacity water pipes that have fixed flow rates  except for expensive pumps and valves. We bury them in the ground. If anything changes    if the environment changes  the ground moves  or demand changes    we have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them. So I'd like to propose that we can combine those two worlds  that we can combine the world of the nanoscale programmable adaptive materials and the built environment. And I don't mean automated machines. I don't just mean smart machines that replace humans. But I mean programmable materials that build themselves. And that's called self assembly  which is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure through only local interaction. So what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale  We need a few simple ingredients. The first ingredient is materials and geometry  and that needs to be tightly coupled with the energy source. And you can use passive energy    so heat  shaking  pneumatics  gravity  magnetics. And then you need smartly designed interactions. And those interactions allow for error correction  and they allow the shapes to go from one state to another state. So now I'm going to show you a number of projects that we've built  from one dimensional  two dimensional  three dimensional and even four dimensional systems. So in one dimensional systems    this is a project called the self folding proteins. And the idea is that you take the three dimensional structure of a protein    in this case it's the crambin protein    you take the backbone    so no cross linking  no environmental interactions    and you break that down into a series of components. And then we embed elastic. And when I throw this up into the air and catch it  it has the full three dimensional structure of the protein  all of the intricacies. And this gives us a tangible model of the three dimensional protein and how it folds and all of the intricacies of the geometry. So we can study this as a physical  intuitive model. And we're also translating that into two dimensional systems    so flat sheets that can self fold into three dimensional structures. In three dimensions  we did a project last year at TEDGlobal with Autodesk and Arthur Olson where we looked at autonomous parts    so individual parts not pre connected that can come together on their own. And we built     of these glass beakers. They had different molecular structures inside and different colors that could be mixed and matched. And we gave them away to all the TEDsters. And so these became intuitive models to understand how molecular self assembly works at the human scale. This is the polio virus. You shake it hard and it breaks apart. And then you shake it randomly and it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own. And this is demonstrating that through random energy  we can build non random shapes. We even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale. Last year at TED Long Beach  we built an installation that builds installations. The idea was  could we self assemble furniture scale objects  So we built a large rotating chamber  and people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slower  adding energy to the system and getting an intuitive understanding of how self assembly works and how we could use this as a macroscale construction or manufacturing technique for products. So remember  I said  D. So today for the first time  we're unveiling a new project  which is a collaboration with Stratasys  and it's called  D printing. The idea behind  D printing is that you take multi material  D printing    so you can deposit multiple materials    and you add a new capability  which is transformation  that right off the bed  the parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own. And this is like robotics without wires or motors. So you completely print this part  and it can transform into something else. We also worked with Autodesk on a software they're developing called Project Cyborg. And this allows us to simulate this self assembly behavior and try to optimize which parts are folding when. But most importantly  we can use this same software for the design of nanoscale self assembly systems and human scale self assembly systems. These are parts being printed with multi material properties. Here's the first demonstration. A single strand dipped in water that completely self folds on its own into the letters M I T. I'm biased. This is another part  single strand  dipped in a bigger tank that self folds into a cube  a three dimensional structure  on its own. So no human interaction. And we think this is the first time that a program and transformation has been embedded directly into the materials themselves. And it also might just be the manufacturing technique that allows us to produce more adaptive infrastructure in the future. So I know you're probably thinking  okay  that's cool  but how do we use any of this stuff for the built environment  So I've started a lab at MIT  and it's called the Self Assembly Lab. And we're dedicated to trying to develop programmable materials for the built environment. And we think there's a few key sectors that have fairly near term applications. One of those is in extreme environments. These are scenarios where it's difficult to build  our current construction techniques don't work  it's too large  it's too dangerous  it's expensive  too many parts. And space is a great example of that. We're trying to design new scenarios for space that have fully reconfigurable and self assembly structures that can go from highly functional systems from one to another. Let's go back to infrastructure. In infrastructure  we're working with a company out of Boston called Geosyntec. And we're developing a new paradigm for piping. Imagine if water pipes could expand or contract to change capacity or change flow rate  or maybe even undulate like peristaltics to move the water themselves. So this isn't expensive pumps or valves. This is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own. So I want to remind you today of the harsh realities of assembly in our world. These are complex things built with complex parts that come together in complex ways. So I would like to invite you from whatever industry you're from to join us in reinventing and reimagining the world  how things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale  so that we can go from a world like this to a world that's more like this. Thank you. In two weeks time  that's the ninth anniversary of the day I first stepped out onto that hallowed  Jeopardy  set. I mean  nine years is a long time. And given  Jeopardy's  average demographics  I think what that means is most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead. But not all  a few are still alive. Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever. And when I do  it's as a bit of a know it all. I think that ship has sailed  it's too late for me. For better or for worse  that's what I'm going to be known as  as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff. And I can't complain about this. I feel like that was always sort of my destiny  although I had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet. If nothing else  you realize very quickly as a teenager  it is not a hit with girls to know Captain Kirk's middle name. And as a result  I was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know it all for many years. But if you go further back  if you look at it  it's all there. I was the kind of kid who was always bugging Mom and Dad with whatever great fact I had just read about    Haley's comet or giant squids or the size of the world's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was. I now have a    year old of my own who's exactly the same. And I know how deeply annoying it is  so karma does work. And I loved game shows  fascinated with game shows. I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in      because it had just hit me  as badly as I wanted to go to school  that I was also going to miss  Hollywood Squares  and  Family Feud.  I was going to miss my game shows. And later  in the mid '  s  when  Jeopardy  came back on the air  I remember running home from school every day to watch the show. It was my favorite show  even before it paid for my house. And we lived overseas  we lived in South Korea where my dad was working  where there was only one English language TV channel. There was Armed Forces TV  and if you didn't speak Korean  that's what you were watching. So me and all my friends would run home every day and watch  Jeopardy.  I was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid. I remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the '  s and holding my own  back when that was a fad. There's a weird sense of mastery you get when you know some bit of boomer trivia that Mom and Dad don't know. You know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn't know. And you think  ah hah  knowledge really is power    the right fact deployed at exactly the right place. I never had a guidance counselor who thought this was a legitimate career path  that thought you could major in trivia or be a professional ex game show contestant. And so I sold out way too young. I didn't try to figure out what one does with that. I studied computers because I heard that was the thing  and I became a computer programmer    not an especially good one  not an especially happy one at the time when I was first on  Jeopardy  in     . But that's what I was doing. And it made it doubly ironic    my computer background    a few years later  I think      or so  when I got another phone call from  Jeopardy  saying   It's early days yet  but IBM tells us they want to build a supercomputer to beat you at 'Jeopardy.' Are you up for this   This was the first I'd heard of it. And of course I said yes  for several reasons. One  because playing  Jeopardy  is a great time. It's fun. It's the most fun you can have with your pants on. And I would do it for nothing. I don't think they know that  luckily  but I would go back and play for Arby's coupons. I just love  Jeopardy   and I always have. And second of all  because I'm a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future. People playing computers on game shows was the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future  and now I could be on the stage with it. I was not going to say no. The third reason I said yes is because I was pretty confident that I was going to win. I had taken some artificial intelligence classes. I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on  Jeopardy.  People don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program that can read a  Jeopardy  clue in a natural language like English and understand all the double meanings  the puns  the red herrings  unpack the meaning of the clue. The kind of thing that a three  or four year old human  little kid could do  very hard for a computer. And I thought  well this is going to be child's play. Yes  I will come destroy the computer and defend my species. But as the years went on  as IBM started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this  I started to get occasional updates from them  and I started to get a little more worried. I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph. It was a scatter chart showing performance on  Jeopardy   tens of thousands of dots representing  Jeopardy  champions up at the top with their performance plotted on number of    I was going to say questions answered  but answers questioned  I guess  clues responded to    versus the accuracy of those answers. So there's a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to. And at first  it was very low. There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena. But then you see the line start to go up. And it's getting very close to what they call the winner's cloud. And I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart some darker dots  some black dots  that were a different color. And thought  what are these   The black dots in the upper right represent    time 'Jeopardy' champion Ken Jennings.  And I saw this line coming for me. And I realized  this is it. This is what it looks like when the future comes for you. It's not the Terminator's gun sight  it's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do  the only thing that makes you special  the thing you're best at. And when the game eventually happened about a year later  it was very different than the  Jeopardy  games I'd been used to. We were not playing in L.A. on the regular  Jeopardy  set. Watson does not travel. Watson's actually huge. It's thousands of processors  a terabyte of memory  trillions of bytes of memory. We got to walk through his climate controlled server room. The only other  Jeopardy  contestant to this day I've ever been inside. And so Watson does not travel. You must come to it  you must make the pilgrimage. So me and the other human player wound up at this secret IBM research lab in the middle of these snowy woods in Westchester County to play the computer. And we realized right away that the computer had a big home court advantage. There was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage. Like you're going to play the Chicago Bulls  and there's the thing in the middle of their court. And the crowd was full of IBM V.P.s and programmers cheering on their little darling  having poured millions of dollars into this hoping against hope that the humans screw up  and holding up  Go Watson  signs and just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right. I think guys had  W A T S O N  written on their bellies in grease paint. If you can imagine computer programmers with the letters  W A T S O N  written on their gut  it's an unpleasant sight. But they were right. They were exactly right. I don't want to spoil it  if you still have this sitting on your DVR  but Watson won handily. And I remember standing there behind the podium as I could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking. It had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer. And you could hear that little tick  tick  tick  tick. And I remember thinking  this is it. I felt obsolete. I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the '  s seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line. I felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete under this new regime of thinking computers. And it hasn't been the last. If you watch the news  you'll see occasionally    and I see this all the time    that pharmacists now  there's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically without actually needing a human pharmacist. And a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals because there's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions. You don't need human assistants for that anymore. I read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score from a baseball or football game and it spits out a news article as if a human had watched the game and was commenting on it. And obviously these new technologies can't do as clever or creative a job as the humans they're replacing  but they're faster  and crucially  they're much  much cheaper. So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be. I've read economists saying that  as a result of these new technologies  we'll enter a new golden age of leisure when we'll all have time for the things we really love because all these onerous tasks will be taken over by Watson and his digital brethren. I've heard other people say quite the opposite  that this is yet another tier of the middle class that's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology and that this is actually something ominous  something that we should worry about. I'm not an economist myself. All I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work. And it was friggin' demoralizing. It was terrible. Here's the one thing that I was ever good at  and all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people and thousands of processors working in parallel and they could do the same thing. They could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV  and  I'm sorry  Ken. We don't need you anymore.  And it made me think  what does this mean  if we're going to be able to start outsourcing  not just lower unimportant brain functions. I'm sure many of you remember a distant time when we had to know phone numbers  when we knew our friends' phone numbers. And suddenly there was a machine that did that  and now we don't need to remember that anymore. I have read that there's now actually evidence that the hippocampus  the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships  physically shrinks and atrophies in people who use tools like GPS  because we're not exercising our sense of direction anymore. We're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard. And as a result  a part of our brain that's supposed to do that kind of stuff gets smaller and dumber. And it made me think  what happens when computers are now better at knowing and remembering stuff than we are  Is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that  Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less  As somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know  this was a terrifying idea to me. The more I thought about it  I realized  no  it's still important. The things we know are still important. I came to believe there were two advantages that those of us who have these things in our head have over somebody who says   Oh  yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second.  There's an advantage of volume  and there's an advantage of time. The advantage of volume  first  just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays. There's so much information out there. Being a Renaissance man or woman  that's something that was only possible in the Renaissance. Now it's really not possible to be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor. There's just too much. They say that the scope of human information is now doubling every    months or so  the sum total of human information. That means between now and late       we will generate as much information  in terms of gigabytes  as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together. It's doubling every    months now. This is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts. A decision like where do I go to school  What should I major in  Who do I vote for  Do I take this job or that one  These are the decisions that require correct judgments about many different kinds of facts. If we have those facts at our mental fingertips  we're going to be able to make informed decisions. If  on the other hand  we need to look them all up  we may be in trouble. According to a National Geographic survey I just saw  somewhere along the lines of    percent of the people who vote in a U.S. presidential election about issues like foreign policy cannot find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map. If you can't do that first step  are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you're going to need to know to master your knowledge of U.S. foreign policy  Quite probably not. At some point you're just going to be like   You know what  There's too much to know. Screw it.  And you'll make a less informed decision. The other issue is the advantage of time that you have if you have all these things at your fingertips. I always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith. She was a    year old girl from Surrey  England on vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket  Thailand. She runs up to them on the beach one morning and says   Mom  Dad  we've got to get off the beach.  And they say   What do you mean  We just got here.  And she said   In Mr. Kearney's geography class last month  he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea and you see the waves churning way out there  that's the sign of a tsunami  and you need to clear the beach.  What would you do if your    year old daughter came up to you with this  Her parents thought about it  and they finally  to their credit  decided to believe her. They told the lifeguard  they went back to the hotel  and the lifeguard cleared over     people off the beach  luckily  because that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami  the day after Christmas        that killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean. But not on that beach  not on Mai Khao Beach  because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before. Now when facts come in handy like that    I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact  one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time    normally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life. But in this case it happened in real life. And it happens in real life all the time. It's not always a tsunami  often it's a social situation. It's a meeting or job interview or first date or some relationship that gets lubricated because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge. You say where you're from  and I say   Oh  yeah.  Or your alma mater or your job  and I know just a little something about it  enough to get the ball rolling. People love that shared connection that gets created when somebody knows something about you. It's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met. That's often the advantage of time. And it's not effective if you say   Well  hold on. You're from Fargo  North Dakota. Let me see what comes up. Oh  yeah. Roger Maris was from Fargo.  That doesn't work. That's just annoying. The great   th century British theologian and thinker  friend of Dr. Johnson  Samuel Parr once said   It's always better to know a thing than not to know it.  And if I have lived my life by any kind of creed  it's probably that. I have always believed that the things we know    that knowledge is an absolute good  that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads are what make us who we are  as individuals and as a species. I don't know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete. I don't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced by these little bubbles of specialty  so that none of us know about the common associations that used to bind our civilization together. I don't want to be the last trivia know it all sitting on a mountain somewhere  reciting to himself the state capitals and the names of  Simpsons  episodes and the lyrics of Abba songs. I feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices  to our search engines and our smartphones. In the movies  when computers like Watson start to think  things don't always end well. Those movies are never about beautiful utopias. It's always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in      .  Things always go terribly wrong. And I feel like we're sort of at the point now where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in. This is a question of leadership  because it becomes a question of who leads the future. On the one hand  we can choose between a new golden age where information is more universally available than it's ever been in human history  where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips. And on the other hand  we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia where the machines have taken over and we've all decided it's not important what we know anymore  that knowledge isn't valuable because it's all out there in the cloud  and why would we ever bother learning anything new. Those are the two choices we have. I know which future I would rather be living in. And we can all make that choice. We make that choice by being curious  inquisitive people who like to learn  who don't just say   Well  as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over  I don't have to learn anymore   or  Thank goodness I have my diploma. I'm done learning for a lifetime. I don't have to learn new things anymore.  No  every day we should be striving to learn something new. We should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us. That's where the people you see on  Jeopardy  come from. These know it alls  they're not Rainman style savants sitting at home memorizing the phone book. I've met a lot of them. For the most part  they are just normal folks who are universally interested in the world around them  curious about everything  thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject. We can live in one of these two worlds. We can live in a world where our brains  the things that we know  continue to be the thing that makes us special  or a world in which we've outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like Watson. Ladies and gentlemen  the choice is yours. Thank you very much. So I'll be talking about the success of my campus  the University of Maryland  Baltimore County  UMBC  in educating students of all types  across the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas. What makes our story especially important is that we have learned so much from a group of students who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder    students of color  students underrepresented in selected areas. And what makes the story especially unique is that we have learned how to help African American students  Latino students  students from low income backgrounds  to become some of the best in the world in science and engineering. And so I begin with a story about my childhood. We all are products of our childhood experiences. It's hard for me to believe that it's been    years since I had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in Birmingham  Alabama  a kid who loved getting A's  a kid who loved math  who loved to read  a kid who would say to the teacher    when the teacher said   Here are    problems   to the class  this little fat kid would say   Give us    more.  And the whole class would say   Shut up  Freeman.  And there was a designated kicker every day. And so I was always asking this question   Well how could we get more kids to really love to learn   And amazingly  one week in church  when I really didn't want to be there and I was in the back of the room being placated by doing math problems  I heard this man say this   If we can get the children to participate in this peaceful demonstration here in Birmingham  we can show America that even children know the difference between right and wrong and that children really do want to get the best possible education.  And I looked up and said   Who is that man   And they said his name was Dr. Martin Luther King. And I said to my parents   I've got to go. I want to go. I want to be a part of this.  And they said   Absolutely not.  And we had a rough go of it. And at that time  quite frankly  you really did not talk back to your parents. And somehow I said   You know  you guys are hypocrites. You make me go to this. You make me listen. The man wants me to go  and now you say no.  And they thought about it all night. And they came into my room the next morning. They had not slept. They had been literally crying and praying and thinking   Will we let our    year old participate in this march and probably have to go to jail   And they decided to do it. And when they came in to tell me  I was at first elated. And then all of a sudden I began thinking about the dogs and the fire hoses  and I got really scared  I really did. And one of the points I make to people all the time is that sometimes when people do things that are courageous  it doesn't really mean that they're that courageous. It simply means that they believe it's important to do it. I wanted a better education. I did not want to have to have hand me down books. I wanted to know that the school I attended not only had good teachers  but the resources we needed. And as a result of that experience  in the middle of the week  while I was there in jail  Dr. King came and said with our parents   What you children do this day will have an impact on children who have not been born.  I recently realized that two thirds of Americans today had not been born at the time of     . And so for them  when they hear about the Children's Crusade in Birmingham  in many ways  if they see it on TV  it's like our looking at the       Lincoln  movie  It's history. And the real question is  what lessons did we learn  Well amazingly  the most important for me was this  That children can be empowered to take ownership of their education. They can be taught to be passionate about wanting to learn and to love the idea of asking questions. And so it is especially significant that the university I now lead  the University of Maryland  Baltimore County  UMBC  was founded the very year I went to jail with Dr. King  in     . And what made that institutional founding especially important is that Maryland is the South  as you know  and  quite frankly  it was the first university in our state founded at a time when students of all races could go there. And so we had black and white students and others who began to attend. And it has been for    years an experiment. The experiment is this  Is it possible to have institutions in our country  universities  where people from all backgrounds can come and learn and learn to work together and learn to become leaders and to support each other in that experience  Now what is especially important about that experience for me is this  We found that we could do a lot in the arts and humanities and social sciences. And so we began to work on that  for years in the '  s. And we produced a number of people in law  all the way to the humanities. We produced great artists. Beckett is our muse. A lot of our students get into theater. It's great work. The problem that we faced was the same problem America continues to face    that students in the sciences and engineering  black students were not succeeding. But when I looked at the data  what I found was that  quite frankly  students in general  large numbers were not making it. And as a result of that  we decided to do something that would help  first of all  the group at the bottom  African American students  and then Hispanic students. And Robert and Jane Meyerhoff  philanthropists  said   We'd like to help.  Robert Meyerhoff said   Why is it that everything I see on TV about black boys  if it's not about basketball  is not positive  I'd like to make a difference  to do something that's positive.  We married those ideas  and we created this Meyerhoff Scholars program. And what is significant about the program is that we learned a number of things. And the question is this  How is it that now we lead the country in producing African Americans who go on to complete Ph.D.'s in science and engineering and M.D. Ph.D.'s  That's a big deal. Give me a hand for that. That's a big deal. That's a big deal. It really is. You see  most people don't realize that it's not just minorities who don't do well in science and engineering. Quite frankly  you're talking about Americans. If you don't know it  while    percent of blacks and Hispanics who begin with a major in science and engineering will actually graduate in science and engineering  only    percent of whites who begin with majors in those areas actually succeed and graduate in those areas  and only    percent of Asian Americans. And so  the real question is  what is the challenge  Well a part of it  of course  is K   . We need to strengthen K   . But the other part has to do with the culture of science and engineering on our campuses. Whether you know it or not  large numbers of students with high SAT's and large numbers of A.P. credits who go to the most prestigious universities in our country begin in pre med or pre engineering and engineering  and they end up changing their majors. And the number one reason  we find  quite frankly  is they did not do well in first year science courses. In fact  we call first year science and engineering  typically around America  weed out courses or barrier courses. How many of you in this audience know somebody who started off in pre med or engineering and changed their major within a year or two  It's an American challenge. Half of you in the room. I know. I know. I know. And what is interesting about that is that so many students are smart and can do it. We need to find ways of making it happen. So what are the four things we did to help minority students that now are helping students in general  Number one  high expectations. It takes an understanding of the academic preparation of students    their grades  the rigor of the course work  their test taking skills  their attitude  the fire in their belly  the passion for the work  to make it. And so doing things to help students prepare to be in that position  very important. But equally important  it takes an understanding that it's hard work that makes the difference. I don't care how smart you are or how smart you think you are. Smart simply means you're ready to learn. You're excited about learning and you want to ask good questions. I. I. Rabi  a Nobel laureate  said that when he was growing up in New York  all of his friends' parents would ask them  What did you learn in school   at the end of a day. And he said  in contrast  his Jewish mother would say   Izzy  did you ask a good question today   And so high expectations have to do with curiosity and encouraging young people to be curious. And as a result of those high expectations  we began to find students we wanted to work with to see what could we do to help them  not simply to survive in science and engineering  but to become the very best  to excel. Interestingly enough  an example  One young man who earned a C in the first course and wanted to go on to med school  we said   We need to have you retake the course  because you need a strong foundation if you're going to move to the next level.  Every foundation makes the difference in the next level. He retook the course. That young man went on to graduate from UMBC  to become the first black to get the M.D. Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. He now works at Harvard. Nice story. Give him a hand for that too. Secondly  it's not about test scores only. Test scores are important  but they're not the most important thing. One young woman had great grades  but test scores were not as high. But she had a factor that was very important. She never missed a day of school  K   . There was fire in that belly. That young woman went on  and she is today with an M.D. Ph.D. from Hopkins. She's on the faculty  tenure track in psychiatry  Ph.D. in neuroscience. She and her adviser have a patent on a second use of Viagra for diabetes patients. Big hand for her. Big hand for her. And so high expectations  very important. Secondly  the idea of building community among the students. You all know that so often in science and engineering we tend to think cutthroat. Students are not taught to work in groups. And that's what we work to do with that group to get them to understand each other  to build trust among them  to support each other  to learn how to ask good questions  but also to learn how to explain concepts with clarity. As you know  it's one thing to earn an A yourself  it's another thing to help someone else do well. And so to feel that sense of responsibility makes all the difference in the world. So building community among those students  very important. Third  the idea of  it takes researchers to produce researchers. Whether you're talking about artists producing artists or you're talking about people getting into the social sciences  whatever the discipline    and especially in science and engineering  as in art  for example    you need scientists to pull the students into the work. And so our students are working in labs regularly. And one great example that you'll appreciate  During a snowstorm in Baltimore several years ago  the guy on our campus with this Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant literally came back to work in his lab after several days  and all these students had refused to leave the lab. They had food they had packed out. They were in the lab working  and they saw the work  not as schoolwork  but as their lives. They knew they were working on AIDS research. They were looking at this amazing protein design. And what was interesting was each one of them focused on that work. And he said   It doesn't get any better than that.  And then finally  if you've got the community and you've got the high expectations and you've got researchers producing researchers  you have to have people who are willing as faculty to get involved with those students  even in the classroom. I'll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying   I've got this young man in class  a young black guy  and he seems like he's just not excited about the work. He's not taking notes. We need to talk to him.  What was significant was that the faculty member was observing every student to understand who was really involved and who was not and was saying   Let me see how I can work with them. Let me get the staff to help me out.  It was that connecting. That young man today is actually a faculty member M.D. Ph.D. in neuroengineering at Duke. Give him a big hand for that. And so the significance is that we have now developed this model that is helping us  not only finally with evaluation  assessing what works. And what we learned was that we needed to think about redesigning courses. And so we redesigned chemistry  we redesigned physics. But now we are looking at redesigning the humanities and social sciences. Because so many students are bored in class. Do you know that  Many students  K    and in universities  don't want to just sit there and listen to somebody talk. They need to be engaged. And so we have done    if you look at our website at the Chemistry Discovery Center  you'll see people coming from all over the country to look at how we are redesigning courses  having an emphasis on collaboration  use of technology  using problems out of our biotech companies on our campus  and not giving students the theories  but having them struggle with those theories. And it's working so well that throughout our university system in Maryland  more and more courses are being redesigned. It's called academic innovation. And what does all of that mean  It means that now  not just in science and engineering  we now have programs in the arts  in the humanities  in the social sciences  in teacher education  even particularly for women in I.T. If you don't know it  there's been a    percent decline in the number of women majoring in computer science just since     . And what I'm saying is that what will make the difference will be building community among students  telling young women  young minority students and students in general  you can do this work. And most important  giving them a chance to build that community with faculty pulling them into the work and our assessing what works and what does not work. Most important  if a student has a sense of self  it is amazing how the dreams and the values can make all the difference in the world. When I was a    year old child in the jail in Birmingham  I kept thinking   I wonder what my future could be.  I had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in Birmingham to one day be president of a university that has students from     countries  where students are not there just to survive  where they love learning  where they enjoy being the best  where they will one day change the world. Aristotle said   Excellence is never an accident. It is the result of high intention  sincere effort and intelligent execution. It represents the wisest option among many alternatives.  And then he said something that gives me goosebumps. He said   Choice  not chance  determines your destiny.  Choice  not chance  determines your destiny  dreams and values. Thank you all very much. So just by a show of hands  how many of you all have a robot at home  Not very many of you. Okay. And actually of those hands  if you don't include Roomba how many of you have a robot at home  So a couple. That's okay. That's the problem that we're trying to solve at Romotive    that I and the other    nerds at Romotive are obsessed with solving. So we really want to build a robot that anyone can use  whether you're eight or   . And as it turns out  that's a really hard problem  because you have to build a small  portable robot that's not only really affordable  but it has to be something that people actually want to take home and have around their kids. This robot can't be creepy or uncanny. He should be friendly and cute. So meet Romo. Romo's a robot that uses a device you already know and love    your iPhone    as his brain. And by leveraging the power of the iPhone's processor  we can create a robot that is wi fi enabled and computer vision capable for     bucks  which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past. When Romo wakes up  he's in creature mode. So he's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face. If I duck down  he'll follow me. He's wary  so he'll keep his eyes on me. If I come over here  he'll turn to follow me. If I come over here     Laughs  He's smart. And if I get too close to him  he gets scared just like any other creature. So in a lot of ways  Romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own. Thanks  little guy. Bless you. And if I want to explore the world    uh oh  Romo's tired    if I want to explore the world with Romo  I can actually connect him from any other iOS device. So here's the iPad. And Romo will actually stream video to this device. So I can see everything that Romo sees  and I get a robot's eye view of the world. Now this is a free app on the App Store  so if any of you guys had this app on your phones  we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together. So I'll show you really quickly  Romo actually    he's streaming video  so you can see me and the entire TED audience. If I get in front of Romo here. And if I want to control him  I can just drive. So I can drive him around  and I can take pictures of you. I've always wanted a picture of a       person TED audience. So I'll snap a picture. And in the same way that you scroll through content on an iPad  I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device. So there are all of you through Romo's eyes. And finally  because Romo is an extension of me  I can express myself through his emotions. So I can go in and I can say let's make Romo excited. But the most important thing about Romo is that we wanted to create something that was literally completely intuitive. You do not have to teach someone how to drive Romo. In fact  who would like to drive a robot  Okay. Awesome. Here you go. Thank you  Scott. And even cooler  you actually don't have to be in the same geographic location as the robot to control him. So he actually streams two way audio and video between any two smart devices. So you can log in through the browser  and it's kind of like Skype on wheels. So we were talking before about telepresence  and this is a really cool example. You can imagine an eight year old girl  for example  who has an iPhone  and her mom buys her a robot. That girl can take her iPhone  put it on the robot  send an email to Grandma  who lives on the other side of the country. Grandma can log into that robot and play hide and go seek with her granddaughter for fifteen minutes every single night  when otherwise she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once or twice a year. Thanks  Scott. So those are a couple of the really cool things that Romo can do today. But I just want to finish by talking about something that we're working on in the future. This is actually something that one of our engineers  Dom  built in a weekend. It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly. This allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code and create any behavior for this robot you want. You do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for Romo. And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser  which is what you see Romo doing on the left. And then if you have something you like  you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life  run the program in real life. And then if you have something you're proud of  you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world. So all of these wi fi enabled robots actually learn from each other. The reason we're so focused on building robots that everyone can train is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal. They change from person to person. So we think that if you're going to have a robot in your home  that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination. So I wish that I could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like. To be honest  I have no idea. But what we do know is that it isn't    years or    billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away. The future of personal robotics is happening today  and it's going to depend on small  agile robots like Romo and the creativity of people like yourselves. So we can't wait to get you all robots  and we can't wait to see what you build. Thank you. I want to talk a little bit today about labor and work. When we think about how people work  the naive intuition we have is that people are like rats in a maze    that all people care about is money  and the moment we give them money  we can direct them to work one way  we can direct them to work another way. This is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways. And we really have this incredibly simplistic view of why people work  and what the labor market looks like. At the same time  if you think about it  there's all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us. Think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing. If you read books of people who climb mountains  difficult mountains  do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness  No  they are full of misery. In fact  it's all about frostbite and having difficulty walking  and difficulty breathing    cold  challenging circumstances. And if people were just trying to be happy  the moment they would get to the top  they would say   This was a terrible mistake. I'll never do it again.   Instead  let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos.  But instead  people go down  and after they recover  they go up again. And if you think about mountain climbing as an example  it suggests all kinds of things. It suggests that we care about reaching the end  a peak. It suggests that we care about the fight  about the challenge. It suggests that there's all kinds of other things that motivate us to work or behave in all kinds of ways. And for me personally  I started thinking about this after a student came to visit me. This was one of my students from a few years earlier  and he came one day back to campus. And he told me the following story  He said that for more than two weeks  he was working on a PowerPoint presentation. He was working in a big bank  and this was in preparation for a merger and acquisition. And he was working very hard on this presentation    graphs  tables  information. He stayed late at night every day. And the day before it was due  he sent his PowerPoint presentation to his boss  and his boss wrote him back and said   Nice presentation  but the merger is canceled.  And the guy was deeply depressed. Now at the moment when he was working  he was actually quite happy. Every night he was enjoying his work  he was staying late  he was perfecting this PowerPoint presentation. But knowing that nobody would ever watch it made him quite depressed. So I started thinking about how do we experiment with this idea of the fruits of our labor. And to start with  we created a little experiment in which we gave people Legos  and we asked them to build with Legos. And for some people  we gave them Legos and we said   Hey  would you like to build this Bionicle for three dollars  We'll pay you three dollars for it.  And people said yes  and they built with these Legos. And when they finished  we took it  we put it under the table  and we said   Would you like to build another one  this time for   .     If they said yes  we gave them another one  and when they finished  we asked them   Do you want to build another one   for   .      .    and so on  until at some point people said   No more. It's not worth it for me.  This was what we called the meaningful condition. People built one Bionicle after another. After they finished every one of them  we put them under the table. And we told them that at the end of the experiment  we will take all these Bionicles  we will disassemble them  we will put them back in the boxes  and we will use it for the next participant. There was another condition. This other condition was inspired by David  my student. And this other condition we called the Sisyphic condition. And if you remember the story about Sisyphus  Sisyphus was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill  and when he almost got to the end  the rock would roll over  and he would have to start again. And you can think about this as the essence of doing futile work. You can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills  at least he would have some sense of progress. Also  if you look at prison movies  sometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners is to get them to dig a hole  and when the prisoner is finished  they ask him to fill the hole back up and then dig again. There's something about this cyclical version of doing something over and over and over that seems to be particularly demotivating. So in the second condition of this experiment  that's exactly what we did. We asked people   Would you like to build one Bionicle for three dollars   And if they said yes  they built it. Then we asked them   Do you want to build another one for   .     And if they said yes  we gave them a new one  and as they were building it  we took apart the one that they just finished. And when they finished that  we said   Would you like to build another one  this time for    cents less   And if they said yes  we gave them the one that they built and we broke. So this was an endless cycle of them building  and us destroying in front of their eyes. Now what happens when you compare these two conditions  The first thing that happened was that people built many more Bionicles    eleven in the meaningful condition  versus seven in the Sisyphus condition. And by the way  we should point out that this was not big meaning. People were not curing cancer or building bridges. People were building Bionicles for a few cents. And not only that  everybody knew that the Bionicles would be destroyed quite soon. So there was not a real opportunity for big meaning. But even the small meaning made a difference. Now we had another version of this experiment. In this other version of the experiment  we didn't put people in this situation  we just described to them the situation  much as I am describing to you now  and we asked them to predict what the result would be. What happened  People predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude. People who were just given the description of the experiment said that in the meaningful condition  people would probably build one more Bionicle. So people understand that meaning is important  they just don't understand the magnitude of the importance  the extent to which it's important. There was one other piece of data we looked at. If you think about it  there are some people who love Legos  and some people who don't. And you would speculate that the people who love Legos would build more Legos  even for less money  because after all  they get more internal joy from it. And the people who love Legos less would build less Legos because the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower. And that's actually what we found in the meaningful condition. There was a very nice correlation between the love of Legos and the amount of Legos people built. What happened in the Sisyphic condition  In that condition  the correlation was zero    there was no relationship between the love of Legos  and how much people built  which suggests to me that with this manipulation of breaking things in front of people's eyes  we basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity. We basically eliminated it. Soon after I finished running this experiment  I went to talk to a big software company in Seattle. I can't tell you who they were  but they were a big company in Seattle. This was a group within the software company that was put in a different building  and they asked them to innovate  and create the next big product for this company. And the week before I showed up  the CEO of this big software company went to that group      engineers  and canceled the project. And I stood there in front of     of the most depressed people I've ever talked to. And I described to them some of these Lego experiments  and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment. And I asked them  I said   How many of you now show up to work later than you used to   And everybody raised their hand. I said   How many of you now go home earlier than you used to   Everybody raised their hand. I asked them   How many of you now add not so kosher things to your expense reports   And they didn't raise their hands  but they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do with expense reports. And then I asked them  I said   What could the CEO have done to make you not as depressed   And they came up with all kinds of ideas. They said the CEO could have asked them to present to the whole company about their journey over the last two years and what they decided to do. He could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology could fit with other parts of the organization. He could have asked them to build some next generation prototypes  and see how they would work. But the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation. And I think the CEO basically did not understand the importance of meaning. If the CEO  just like our participants  thought the essence of meaning is unimportant  then he  wouldn't  care. And he would say   At the moment I directed you in this way  and now that I'm directing you in this way  everything will be okay.  But if you understood how important meaning is  then you would figure out that it's actually important to spend some time  energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they're doing. The next experiment was slightly different. We took a sheet of paper with random letters  and we asked people to find pairs of letters that were identical next to each other. That was the task. People did the first sheet  then we asked if they wanted to do another for a little less money  the next sheet for a little bit less  and so on and so forth. And we had three conditions. In the first condition  people wrote their name on the sheet  found all the pairs of letters  gave it to the experimenter  the experimenter would look at it  scan it from top to bottom  say  Uh huh   and put it on the pile next to them. In the second condition  people did not write their name on it. The experimenter looked at it  took the sheet of paper  did not look at it  did not scan it  and simply put it on the pile of pages. So you take a piece  you just put it on the side. In the third condition  the experimenter got the sheet of paper  and put it directly into a shredder. What happened in those three conditions  In this plot I'm showing you at what pay rate people stopped. So low numbers mean that people worked harder. They worked for much longer. In the acknowledged condition  people worked all the way down to    cents. At    cents per page  they basically stopped these efforts. In the shredder condition  it was twice as much       cents per sheet. And this is basically the result we had before. You shred people's efforts  output    you get them not to be as happy with what they're doing. But I should point out  by the way  that in the shredder condition  people could have cheated. They could have done not so good work  because they realized people were just shredding it. So maybe the first sheet you'd do good work  but then you see nobody is really testing it  so you would do more and more and more. So in fact  in the shredder condition  people could have submitted more work and gotten more money  and put less effort into it. But what about the ignored condition  Would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder  or somewhere in the middle  It turns out it was almost like the shredder. Now there's good news and bad news here. The bad news is that ignoring the performance of people is almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes. Ignoring gets you a whole way out there. The good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done  scanning it and saying  Uh huh   that seems to be quite sufficient to dramatically improve people's motivations. So the good news is that adding motivation doesn't seem to be so difficult. The bad news is that eliminating motivations seems to be incredibly easy  and if we don't think about it carefully  we might overdo it. So this is all in terms of negative motivation  or eliminating negative motivation. The next part I want to show you is something about positive motivation. So there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA. And IKEA is a store with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble. I don't know about you  but every time I assemble one of those  it takes me much longer  it's much more effortful  it's much more confusing  I put things in the wrong way    I can't say I enjoy those pieces. I can't say I enjoy the process. But when I finish it  I seem to like those IKEA pieces of furniture more than I like other ones. And there's an old story about cake mixes. So when they started cake mixes in the '  s  they would take this powder and they would put it in a box  and they would ask housewives to basically pour it in  stir some water in it  mix it  put it in the oven  and    voila    you had cake. But it turns out they were very unpopular. People did not want them  and they thought about all kinds of reasons for that. Maybe the taste was not good  No  the taste was great. What they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved. It was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say   Here is my cake.  No  it was somebody else's cake  as if you bought it in the store. It didn't really feel like your own. So what did they do  They took the eggs and the milk out of the powder. Now you had to break the eggs and add them  you had to measure the milk and add it  mixing it. Now it was your cake. Now everything was fine. Now  I think a little bit like the IKEA effect  by getting people to work harder  they actually got them to love what they're doing to a higher degree. So how do we look at this question experimentally  We asked people to build some origami. We gave them instructions on how to create origami  and we gave them a sheet of paper. And these were all novices  and they built something that was really quite ugly    nothing like a frog or a crane. But then we told them   Look  this origami really belongs to us. You worked for us  but I'll tell you what  we'll sell it to you. How much do you want to pay for it   And we measured how much they were willing to pay for it. And we had two types of people  We had the people who built it  and the people who did not build it  and just looked at it as external observers. And what we found was that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami    and they were willing to pay five times more for them than the people who just evaluated them externally. Now you could say    if you were a builder  do you think  you'd say    Oh  I love this origami  but I know that nobody else would love it   Or  I love this origami  and everybody else will love it as well   Which one of those two is correct  Turns out the builders not only loved the origami more  they thought that everybody would see the world in their view. They thought everybody else would love it more as well. In the next version  we tried to do the IKEA effect. We tried to make it more difficult. So for some people  we gave the same task. For some people  we made it harder by hiding the instructions. At the top of the sheet  we had little diagrams of how you fold origami. For some people  we just eliminated that. So now this was tougher. What happened  Well in an objective way  the origami now was uglier  it was more difficult. Now when we looked at the easy origami  we saw the same thing    builders loved it more  evaluators loved it less. When you looked at the hard instructions  the effect was larger. Why  Because now the builders loved it even more. They put all this extra effort into it. And evaluators  They loved it even less. Because in reality  it was even uglier than the first version. Of course  this tells you something about how we evaluate things. Now think about kids. Imagine I asked you   How much would you sell your kids for   Your memories and associations and so on. Most people would say for a lot  a lot of money. On good days. But imagine this was slightly different. Imagine if you did not have your kids. And one day you went to the park and you met some kids. They were just like your kids  and you played with them for a few hours  and when you were about to leave  the parents said   Hey  by the way  just before you leave  if you're interested  they're for sale.  How much would you pay for them now  Most people say not that much. And this is because our kids are so valuable  not just because of who they are  but because of us  because they are so connected to us  and because of the time and connection. By the way  if you think IKEA instructions are not good  what about the instructions that come with kids  those are really tough. By the way  these are my kids  which  of course  are wonderful and so on. Which comes to tell you one more thing  which is  much like our builders  when they look at the creature of their creation  we don't see that other people don't see things our way. Let me say one last comment. If you think about Adam Smith versus Karl Marx  Adam Smith had a very important notion of efficiency. He gave an example of a pin factory. He said pins have    different steps  and if one person does all    steps  production is very low. But if you get one person to do step one  and one person to do step two and step three and so on  production can increase tremendously. And indeed  this is a great example  and the reason for the Industrial Revolution and efficiency. Karl Marx  on the other hand  said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important in how people think about the connection to what they are doing. And if you do all    steps  you care about the pin. But if you do one step every time  maybe you don't care as much. I think that in the Industrial Revolution  Adam Smith was more correct than Karl Marx. But the reality is that we've switched  and now we're in the knowledge economy. You can ask yourself  what happens in a knowledge economy  Is efficiency still more important than meaning  I think the answer is no. I think that as we move to situations in which people have to decide on their own about how much effort  attention  caring  how connected they feel to it  are they thinking about labor on the way to work  and in the shower and so on  all of a sudden Marx has more things to say to us. So when we think about labor  we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing  but the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it    meaning  creation  challenges  ownership  identity  pride  etc. The good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them    how do we create our own meaning  pride  motivation  and how do we do it in our workplace  and for the employees    I think we could get people to be both more productive and happier. Thank you very much. I want to share some personal friends and stories with you that I've actually never talked about in public before to help illustrate the idea and the need and the hope for us to reinvent our health care system around the world. Twenty four years ago  I had    a sophomore in college  I had a series of fainting spells. No alcohol was involved. And I ended up in student health  and they ran some labwork and came back right away  and said   Kidney problems.  And before I knew it  I was involved and thrown into this six months of tests and trials and tribulations with six doctors across two hospitals in this clash of medical titans to figure out which one of them was right about what was wrong with me. And I'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound  and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once  and I'm like   Uh oh  this is bad news.  And their diagnosis was this  They said   You have two rare kidney diseases that are going to actually destroy your kidneys eventually  you have cancer like cells in your immune system that we need to start treatment right away  and you'll never be eligible for a kidney transplant  and you're not likely to live more than two or three years.  Now  with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis  it just sucked me in immediately  as if I began preparing myself as a patient to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me  until I met a patient named Verna in a waiting room  who became a dear friend  and she grabbed me one day and took me off to the medical library and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases  and said   Eric  these people who get this are normally in their '  s and '  s. They don't know anything about you. Wake up. Take control of your health and get on with your life.  And I did. Now  these people making these proclamations to me were not bad people. In fact  these professionals were miracle workers  but they're working in a flawed  expensive system that's set up the wrong way. It's dependent on hospitals and clinics for our every care need. It's dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us. It's dependent on guesswork of diagnoses and drug cocktails  and so something either works or you die. And it's dependent on passive patients who just take it and don't ask any questions. Now the problem with this model is that it's unsustainable globally. It's unaffordable globally. We need to invent what I call a personal health system. So what does this personal health system look like  and what new technologies and roles is it going to entail  Now  I'm going to start by actually sharing with you a new friend of mine  Libby  somebody I've become quite attached to over the last six months. This is Libby  or actually  this is an ultrasound image of Libby. This is the kidney transplant I was never supposed to have. Now  this is an image that we shot a couple of weeks ago for today  and you'll notice  on the edge of this image  there's some dark spots there  which was really concerning to me. So we're going to actually do a live exam to sort of see how Libby's doing. This is not a wardrobe malfunction. I have to take my belt off here. Don't you in the front row worry or anything. I'm going to use a device from a company called Mobisante. This is a portable ultrasound. It can plug into a smartphone. It can plug into a tablet. Mobisante is up in Redmond  Washington  and they kindly trained me to actually do this on myself. They're not approved to do this. Patients are not approved to do this. This is a concept demo  so I want to make that clear. All right  I gotta gel up. Now the people in the front row are very nervous.  Laughter  And I want to actually introduce you to Dr. Batiuk  who's another friend of mine. He's up in Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland  Oregon. So let me just make sure. Hey  Dr. Batiuk. Can you hear me okay  And actually  can you see Libby  Thomas Batuik  Hi there  Eric. You look busy. How are you  Eric Dishman  I'm good. I'm just taking my clothes off in front of a few hundred people. It's wonderful. So I just wanted to see  is this the image you need to get  And I know you want to look and see if those spots are still there. TB  Okay. Well let's scan around a little bit here  give me a lay of the land. ED  All right.TB  Okay. Turn it a little bit inside  a little bit toward the middle for me. Okay  that's good. How about up a little bit  Okay  freeze that image. That's a good one for me. ED  All right. Now last week  when I did this  you had me measure that spot to the right. Should I do that again  TB  Yeah  let's do that. ED  All right. This is kind of hard to do with one hand on your belly and one hand on measuring  but I've got it  I think  and I'll save that image and send it to you. So tell me a little bit about what this dark spot means. It's not something I was very happy about. TB  Many people after a kidney transplant will develop a little fluid collection around the kidney. Most of the time it doesn't create any kind of mischief  but it does warrant looking at  so I'm happy we've got an opportunity to look at it today  make sure that it's not growing  it's not creating any problems. Based on the other images we have  I'm really happy how it looks today. ED  All right. Well  I guess we'll double check it when I come in. I've got my six month biopsy in a couple of weeks  and I'm going to let you do that in the clinic  because I don't think I can do that one on myself. TB  Good choice.ED  All right  thanks  Dr. Batiuk. All right. So what you're sort of seeing here is an example of disruptive technologies  of mobile  social and analytic technologies. These are the foundations of what's going to make personal health possible. Now there's really three pillars of this personal health I want to talk to you about now  and it's care anywhere  care networking and care customization. And you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with Dr. Batiuk. So let's start with care anywhere. Humans invented the idea of hospitals and clinics in the     s. It is time to update our thinking. We have got to untether clinicians and patients from the notion of traveling to a special bricks and mortar place for all of our care  because these places are often the wrong tool  and the most expensive tool  for the job. And these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients  especially in an era of superbugs and hospital acquired infections. And many countries are going to go brickless from the start because they're never going to be able to afford the mega medicalplexes that a lot of the rest of the world has built. Now I personally learned that hospitals can be a very dangerous place at a young age. This was me in third grade. I broke my elbow very seriously  had to have surgery  worried that they were going to actually lose the arm. Recovering from the surgery in the hospital  I get bedsores. Those bedsores become infected  and they give me an antibiotic which I end up being allergic to  and now my whole body breaks out  and now all of those become infected. The longer I stayed in the hospital  the sicker I became  and the more expensive it became  and this happens to millions of people around the world every year. The future of personal health that I'm talking about says care must occur at home as the default model  not in a hospital or clinic. You have to earn your way into those places by being sick enough to use that tool for the job. Now the smartphones that we're already carrying can clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them  and a whole array of others  today  and as sensing is built into these  we'll be able to do vital signs monitor and behavioral monitoring like we've never had before. Many of us will have implantables that will actually look real time at what's going on with our blood chemistry and in our proteins right now. Now the software is also getting smarter  right  Think about a coach  an agent online  that's going to help me do safe self care. That same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound will likely have real time image processing  and the device will say   Up  down  left  right  ah  Eric  that's the perfect spot to send that image off to your doctor.  Now  if we've got all these networked devices that are helping us to do care anywhere  it stands to reason that we also need a team to be able to interact with all of that stuff  and that leads to the second pillar I want to talk about  care networking. We have got to go beyond this paradigm of isolated specialists doing parts care to multidisciplinary teams doing person care. Uncoordinated care today is expensive at best  and it is deadly at worst. Eighty percent of medical errors are actually caused by communication and coordination problems amongst medical team members. I had my own heart scare years ago in graduate school  when we're under treatment for the kidney  and suddenly  they're like   Oh  we think you have a heart problem.  And I have these palpitations that are showing up. They put me through five weeks of tests    very expensive  very scary    before the nurse finally notices the piece of the paper  my meds list that I've been carrying to every single appointment  and says   Oh my gosh.  Three different specialists had prescribed three different versions of the same drug to me. I did not have a heart problem. I had an overdose problem. I had a care coordination problem. And this happens to millions of people every year. I want to use technology that we're all working on and making happen to make health care a coordinated team sport. Now this is the most frightening thing to me. Out of all the care I've had in hospitals and clinics around the world  the first time I've ever had a true team based care experience was at Legacy Good Sam these last six months for me to go get this. And this is a picture of my graduation team from Legacy. There's a couple of the folks here. You'll recognize Dr. Batiuk. We just talked to him. Here's Jenny  one of the nurses  Allison  who helped manage the transplant list  and a dozen other people who aren't pictured  a pharmacist  a psychologist  a nutritionist  even a financial counselor  Lisa  who helped us deal with all the insurance hassles. I wept the day I graduated. I should have been happy  because I was so well that I could go back to my normal doctors  but I wept because I was so actually connected to this team. And here's the most important part. The other people in this picture are me and my wife  Ashley. Legacy trained us on how to do care for me at home so that they could offload the hospitals and clinics. That's the only way that the model works. My team is actually working in China on one of these self care models for a project we called Age Friendly Cities. We're trying to help build a social network that can help track and train the care of seniors caring for themselves as well as the care provided by their family members or volunteer community health workers  as well as have an exchange network online  where  for example  I can donate three hours of care a day to your mom  if somebody else can help me with transportation to meals  and we exchange all of that online. The most important point I want to make to you about this is the sacred and somewhat over romanticized doctor patient one on one is a relic of the past. The future of health care is smart teams  and you'd better be on that team for yourself. Now  the last thing that I want to talk to you about is care customization  because if you've got care anywhere and you've got care networking  those are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system  but there's still too much guesswork. Randomized clinical trials were actually invented in      to help invent the drugs that cured tuberculosis  and those are important things  don't get me wrong. These population studies that we've done have created tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives  but the problem is that health care is treating us as averages  not unique individuals  because at the end of the day  the patient is not the same thing as the population who are studied. That's what's leading to the guesswork. The technologies that are coming  high performance computing  analytics  big data that everyone's talking about  will allow us to build predictive models for each of us as individual patients. And the magic here is  experiment on my avatar in software  not my body in suffering. Now  I've had two examples I want to quickly share with you of this kind of care customization on my own journey. The first was quite simple. I finally realized some years ago that all my medical teams were optimizing my treatment for longevity. It's like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live. I was optimizing my life for quality of life  and quality of life for me means time in snow. So on my chart  I forced them to put   Patient goal  low doses of drugs over longer periods of time  side effects friendly to skiing.  And I think that's why I achieved longevity. I think that time in snow therapy was as important as the pharmaceuticals that I had. Now the second example of customization    and by the way  you can't customize care if you don't know your own goals  so health care can't know those until you know your own health care goals. But the second example I want to give you is  I happened to be an early guinea pig  and I got very lucky to have my whole genome sequenced. Now it took about two weeks of processing on Intel's highest end servers to make this happen  and another six months of human and computing labor to make sense of all of that data. And at the end of all of that  they said   Yes  those diagnoses of that clash of medical titans all of those years ago were wrong  and we have a better path forward.  The future that Intel's working on now is to figure out how to make that computing for personalized medicine go from months and weeks to even hours  and make this kind of tool available  not just in the mainframes of tier one research hospitals around the world  but in the mainstream    every patient  every clinic with access to whole genome sequencing. And I tell you  this kind of care customization for everything from your goals to your genetics will be the most game changing transformation that we witness in health care during our lifetime. So these three pillars of personal health  care anywhere  care networking  care customization  are happening in pieces now  but this vision will completely fail if we don't step up as caregivers and as patients to take on new roles. It's what my friend Verna said  Wake up and take control of your health. Because at the end of the day these technologies are simply about people caring for other people and ourselves in some powerful new ways. And it's in that spirit that I want to introduce you to one last friend  very quickly. Tracey Gamley stepped up to give me the impossible kidney that I was never supposed to have. So Tracey  just tell us a little bit quickly about what the donor experience was like with you. Tracey Gamley  For me  it was really easy. I only had one night in the hospital. The surgery was done laparoscopically  so I have just five very small scars on my abdomen  and I had four weeks away from work and went back to doing everything I'd done before without any changes. ED  Well  I probably will never get a chance to say this to you in such a large audience ever again. So  thank you  feel likes a really trite word  but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life. This TED stage and all of the TED stages are often about celebrating innovation and celebrating new technologies  and I've done that here today  and I've seen amazing things coming from TED speakers  I mean  my gosh  artificial kidneys  even printable kidneys  that are coming. But until such time that these amazing technologies are available to all of us  and even when they are  it's up to us to care for  and even save  one another. I hope you will go out and make personal health happen for yourselves and for everyone. Thanks so much. I'd like you to come back with me for a moment to the   th century  specifically to June         . The British Association for the Advancement of Science is holding its third meeting at the University of Cambridge. It's the first night of the meeting  and a confrontation is about to take place that will change science forever. An elderly  white haired man stands up. The members of the Association are shocked to realize that it's the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge  who hadn't even left his house in years until that day. They're even more shocked by what he says.  You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers.  Coleridge felt that true philosophers like himself pondered the cosmos from their armchairs. They were not mucking around in the fossil pits or conducting messy experiments with electrical piles like the members of the British Association. The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly. A young Cambridge scholar named William Whewell stood up and quieted the audience. He politely agreed that an appropriate name for the members of the association did not exist.  If 'philosophers' is taken to be too wide and lofty a term   he said   then  by analogy with 'artist ' we may form 'scientist.'  This was the first time the word scientist was uttered in public  only     years ago. I first found out about this confrontation when I was in graduate school  and it kind of blew me away. I mean  how could the word scientist not have existed until       What were scientists called before  What had changed to make a new name necessary precisely at that moment  Prior to this meeting  those who studied the natural world were talented amateurs. Think of the country clergyman or squire collecting his beetles or fossils  like Charles Darwin  for example  or  the hired help of a nobleman  like Joseph Priestley  who was the literary companion to the Marquis of Lansdowne when he discovered oxygen. After this  they were scientists  professionals with a particular scientific method  goals  societies and funding. Much of this revolution can be traced to four men who met at Cambridge University in       Charles Babbage  John Herschel  Richard Jones and William Whewell. These were brilliant  driven men who accomplished amazing things. Charles Babbage  I think known to most TEDsters  invented the first mechanical calculator and the first prototype of a modern computer. John Herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere  and  in his spare time  co invented photography. I'm sure we could all be that productive without Facebook or Twitter to take up our time. Richard Jones became an important economist who later influenced Karl Marx. And Whewell not only coined the term scientist  as well as the words anode  cathode and ion  but spearheaded international big science with his global research on the tides. In the Cambridge winter of      and       the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts. They talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution. They felt science had stagnated since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened in the   th century. It was time for a new revolution  which they pledged to bring about  and what's so amazing about these guys is  not only did they have these grandiose undergraduate dreams  but they actually carried them out  even beyond their wildest dreams. And I'm going to tell you today about four major changes to science these men made. About     years before  Francis Bacon and then  later  Isaac Newton  had proposed an inductive scientific method. Now that's a method that starts from observations and experiments and moves to generalizations about nature called natural laws  which are always subject to revision or rejection should new evidence arise. However  in       David Ricardo muddied the waters by arguing that the science of economics should use a different  deductive method. The problem was that an influential group at Oxford began arguing that because it worked so well in economics  this deductive method ought to be applied to the natural sciences too. The members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed. They wrote books and articles promoting inductive method in all the sciences that were widely read by natural philosophers  university students and members of the public. Reading one of Herschel's books was such a watershed moment for Charles Darwin that he would later say   Scarcely anything in my life made so deep an impression on me. It made me wish to add my might to the accumulated store of natural knowledge.  It also shaped Darwin's scientific method  as well as that used by his peers.  Science for the public good  Previously  it was believed that scientific knowledge ought to be used for the good of the king or queen  or for one's own personal gain. For example  ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports. Harbormasters would gather this knowledge and sell it to the ship captains. The philosophical breakfast club changed that  working together. Whewell's worldwide study of the tides resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps that freely provided the harbormasters' knowledge to all ship captains. Herschel helped by making tidal observations off the coast of South Africa  and  as he complained to Whewell  he was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble. The four men really helped each other in every way. They also relentlessly lobbied the British government for the money to build Babbage's engines because they believed these engines would have a huge practical impact on society. In the days before pocket calculators  the numbers that most professionals needed    bankers  insurance agents  ship captains  engineers   were to be found in lookup books like this  filled with tables of figures. These tables were calculated using a fixed procedure over and over by part time workers known as    and this is amazing    computers  but these calculations were really difficult. I mean  this nautical almanac published the lunar differences for every month of the year. Each month required       calculations  so these tables were filled with mistakes. Babbage's difference engine was the first mechanical calculator devised to accurately compute any of these tables. Two models of his engine were built in the last    years by a team from the Science Museum of London using his own plans. This is the one now at the Computer History Museum in California  and it calculates accurately. It actually works. Later  Babbage's analytical engine was the first mechanical computer in the modern sense. It had a separate memory and central processor. It was capable of iteration  conditional branching and parallel processing  and it was programmable using punched cards  an idea Babbage took from Jacquard's loom. Tragically  Babbage's engines never were built in his day because most people thought that non human computers would have no usefulness for the public.  New scientific institutions  Founded in Bacon's time  the Royal Society of London was the foremost scientific society in England and even in the rest of the world. By the   th century  it had become a kind of gentleman's club populated mainly by antiquarians  literary men and the nobility. The members of the philosophical breakfast club helped form a number of new scientific societies  including the British Association. These new societies required that members be active researchers publishing their results. They reinstated the tradition of the Q A after scientific papers were read  which had been discontinued by the Royal Society as being ungentlemanly. And for the first time  they gave women a foot in the door of science. Members were encouraged to bring their wives  daughters and sisters to the meetings of the British Association  and while the women were expected to attend only the public lectures and the social events like this one  they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well. The British Association would later be the first of the major national science organizations in the world to admit women as full members.  External funding for science  Up to the   th century  natural philosophers were expected to pay for their own equipment and supplies. Occasionally  there were prizes  such as that given to John Harrison in the   th century  for solving the so called longitude problem  but prizes were only given after the fact  when they were given at all. On the advice of the philosophical breakfast club  the British Association began to use the extra money generated by its meetings to give grants for research in astronomy  the tides  fossil fish  shipbuilding  and many other areas. These grants not only allowed less wealthy men to conduct research  but they also encouraged thinking outside the box  rather than just trying to solve one pre set question. Eventually  the Royal Society and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit  and this has become    fortunately it's become    a major part of the scientific landscape today. So the philosophical breakfast club helped invent the modern scientist. That's the heroic part of their story. There's a flip side as well. They did not foresee at least one consequence of their revolution. They would have been deeply dismayed by today's disjunction between science and the rest of culture. It's shocking to realize that only    percent of American adults have even a very basic level of science literacy  and this was tested by asking simple questions like   Did humans and dinosaurs inhabit the Earth at the same time   and  What proportion of the Earth is covered in water   Once scientists became members of a professional group  they were slowly walled off from the rest of us. This is the unintended consequence of the revolution that started with our four friends. Charles Darwin said   I sometimes think that general and popular treatises are almost as important for the progress of science as original work.  In fact   Origin of Species  was written for a general and popular audience  and was widely read when it first appeared. Darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten  that science is not only for scientists. Thank you. Let's talk dirty. A few years ago  oddly enough  I needed the bathroom  and I found one  a public bathroom  and I went into the stall  and I prepared to do what I'd done most of my life  use the toilet  flush the toilet  forget about the toilet. And for some reason that day  instead  I asked myself a question  and it was  where does this stuff go  And with that question  I found myself plunged into the world of sanitation    there's more coming     Laughter    sanitation  toilets and poop  and I have yet to emerge. And that's because it's such an enraging  yet engaging place to be. To go back to that toilet  it wasn't a particularly fancy toilet  it wasn't as nice as this one from the World Toilet Organization. That's the other WTO.  Laughter  But it had a lockable door  it had privacy  it had water  it had soap so I could wash my hands  and I did because I'm a woman  and we do that. But that day  when I asked that question  I learned something  and that was that I'd grown up thinking that a toilet like that was my right  when in fact it's a privilege.  .  billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet. They don't have a bucket or a box. Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet. And they have to do what this little boy is doing by the side of the Mumbai Airport expressway  which is called open defecation  or poo pooing in the open. And he does that every day  and every day  probably  that guy in the picture walks on by  because he sees that little boy  but he doesn't see him. But he should  because the problem with all that poop lying around is that poop carries passengers. Fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit. All those things  the eggs  the cysts  the bacteria  the viruses  all those can travel in one gram of human feces. How  Well  that little boy will not have washed his hands. He's barefoot. He'll run back into his house  and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet. In what I call the flushed and plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in  the most common symptoms associated with those diseases  diarrhea  is now a bit of a joke. It's the runs  the Hershey squirts  the squits. Where I come from  we call it Delhi belly  as a legacy of empire. But if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency  this is the picture that you come up with. Still not sure about the bikini. And here's another image of diarrhea. This is Marie Saylee  nine months old. You can't see her  because she's buried under that green grass in a little village in Liberia  because she died in three days from diarrhea    the Hershey squirts  the runs  a joke. And that's her dad. But she wasn't alone that day  because       other children died of diarrhea  and they do every day. Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide  and you've probably been asked to care about things like HIV AIDS or T.B. or measles  but diarrhea kills more children than all those three things put together. It's a very potent weapon of mass destruction. And the cost to the world is immense      billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation. These are cholera beds in Haiti. You'll have heard of cholera  but we don't hear about diarrhea. It gets a fraction of the attention and funding given to any of those other diseases. But we know how to fix this. We know  because in the mid   th century  wonderful Victorian engineers installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment and the flush toilet  and disease dropped dramatically. Child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history. The flush toilet was voted the best medical advance of the last     years by the readers of the British Medical Journal  and they were choosing over the Pill  anesthesia  and surgery. It's a wonderful waste disposal device. But I think that it's so good   it doesn't smell  we can put it in our house  we can lock it behind a door   and I think we've locked it out of conversation too. We don't have a neutral word for it. Poop's not particularly adequate. Shit offends people. Feces is too medical. Because I can't explain otherwise  when I look at the figures  what's going on. We know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation  but if you look at the budgets of countries  developing and developed  you'll think there's something wrong with the math  because you'll expect absurdities like Pakistan spending    times more on its military than it does on water and sanitation  even though         children die of diarrhea in Pakistan every year. But then you look at that already minuscule water and sanitation budget  and    to    percent of it will go on clean water supply  which is great  we all need water. No one's going to refuse clean water. But the humble latrine  or flush toilet  reduces disease by twice as much as just putting in clean water. Think about it. That little boy who's running back into his house  he may have a nice  clean fresh water supply  but he's got dirty hands that he's going to contaminate his water supply with. And I think that the real waste of human waste is that we are wasting it as a resource and as an incredible trigger for development  because these are a few things that toilets and poop itself can do for us. So a toilet can put a girl back in school. Twenty five percent of girls in India drop out of school because they have no adequate sanitation. They've been used to sitting through lessons for years and years holding it in. We've all done that  but they do it every day  and when they hit puberty and they start menstruating  it just gets too much. And I understand that. Who can blame them  So if you met an educationalist and said   I can improve education attendance rates by    percent with just one simple thing   you'd make a lot of friends in education. That's not the only thing it can do for you. Poop can cook your dinner. It's got nutrients in it. We ingest nutrients. We excrete nutrients as well. We don't keep them all. In Rwanda  they are now getting    percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners' bowels. So these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare. They're genocidal inmates  most of them  and they're stirring the contents of their own latrines  because if you put poop in a sealed environment  in a tank  pretty much like a stomach  then  pretty much like a stomach  it gives off gas  and you can cook with it. And you might think it's just good karma to see these guys stirring shit  but it's also good economic sense  because they're saving a million dollars a year. They're cutting down on deforestation  and they've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible  infinite and free at the point of production. It's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives. Here's a woman who's about to get a dose of the brown stuff in those syringes  which is what you think it is  except not quite  because it's actually donated. There is now a new career path called stool donor. It's like the new sperm donor. Because she has been suffering from a superbug called C. diff  and it's resistant to antibiotics in many cases. She's been suffering for years. She gets a dose of healthy human feces  and the cure rate for this procedure is    percent. It's astonishing  but hardly anyone is still doing it. Maybe it's the ick factor. That's okay  because there's a team of research scientists in Canada who have now created a stool sample  a fake stool sample which is called RePOOPulate. So you'd be thinking by now  okay  the solution's simple  we give everyone a toilet. And this is where it gets really interesting  because it's not that simple  because we are not simple. So the really interesting  exciting work    this is the engaging bit    in sanitation is that we need to understand human psychology. We need to understand software as well as just giving someone hardware. They've found in many developing countries that governments have gone in and given out free latrines and gone back a few years later and found that they've got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms with their owners happily walking past them and going over to the open defecating ground. So the idea is to manipulate human emotion. It's been done for decades. The soap companies did it in the early   th century. They tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it. They tried selling it as sexy. Everyone bought it. In India now there's a campaign which persuades young brides not to marry into families that don't have a toilet. It's called  No Loo  No I Do.  And in case you think that poster's just propaganda  here's Priyanka     years old. I met her last October in India  and she grew up in a conservative environment. She grew up in a rural village in a poor area of India  and she was engaged at     and then at    or so  she moved into her in law's house. And she was horrified to get there and find that they didn't have a toilet. She'd grown up with a latrine. It was no big deal  but it was a latrine. And the first night she was there  she was told that at   o'clock in the morning    her mother in law got her up  told her to go outside and go and do it in the dark in the open. And she was scared. She was scared of drunks hanging around. She was scared of snakes. She was scared of rape. After three days  she did an unthinkable thing. She left. And if you know anything about rural India  you'll know that's an unspeakably courageous thing to do. But not just that. She got her toilet  and now she goes around all the other villages in India persuading other women to do the same thing. It's what I call social contagion  and it's really powerful and really exciting. Another version of this  another village in India near where Priyanka lives is this village  called Lakara  and about a year ago  it had no toilets whatsoever. Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera. Some visitors came  using various behavioral change tricks like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit and watching the flies go one to the other. Somehow  people who'd been thinking that what they were doing was not disgusting at all suddenly thought   Oops.  Not only that  but they were ingesting their neighbors' shit. That's what really made them change their behavior. So this woman  this boy's mother installed this latrine in a few hours. Her entire life  she'd been using the banana field behind  but she installed the latrine in a few hours. It cost nothing. It's going to save that boy's life. So when I get despondent about the state of sanitation  even though these are pretty exciting times because we've got the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation reinventing the toilet  which is great  we've got Matt Damon going on bathroom strike  which is great for humanity  very bad for his colon. But there are things to worry about. It's the most off track Millennium Development Goal. It's about    or so years off track. We're not going to meet targets  providing people with sanitation at this rate. So when I get sad about sanitation  I think of Japan  because Japan    years ago was a nation of people who used pit latrines and wiped with sticks  and now it's a nation of what are called Woshurettos  washlet toilets. They have in built bidet nozzles for a lovely  hands free cleaning experience  and they have various other features like a heated seat and an automatic lid raising device which is known as the  marriage saver.  But most importantly  what they have done in Japan  which I find so inspirational  is they've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door. They've made it conversational. People go out and upgrade their toilet. They talk about it. They've sanitized it. I hope that we can do that. It's not a difficult thing to do. All we really need to do is look at this issue as the urgent  shameful issue that it is. And don't think that it's just in the poor world that things are wrong. Our sewers are crumbling. Things are going wrong here too. The solution to all of this is pretty easy. I'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon and just ask you to do one thing  and that's to go out  protest  speak about the unspeakable  and talk shit. Thank you. So let's start with some good news  and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases  Let's start with leukemia  acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL  the most common cancer of children. When I was a student  the mortality rate was about    percent. Today  some        years later  we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by    percent. Six thousand children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured. If you want the really big numbers  look at these numbers for heart disease. Heart disease used to be the biggest killer  particularly for men in their   s. Today  we've seen a    percent reduction in mortality from heart disease    remarkably   .  million deaths averted every year. AIDS  incredibly  has just been named  in the past month  a chronic disease  meaning that a    year old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks  months  or a couple of years  as we said only a decade ago  but is thought to live decades  probably to die in his '  s or '  s from other causes altogether. These are just remarkable  remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers. And one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about  stroke  which has been  along with heart disease  one of the biggest killers in this country  is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within three hours of the onset  some    percent of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever. Remarkable stories  good news stories  all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early. Early detection  early intervention  that's the story for these successes. Unfortunately  the news is not all good. Let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide. Now this is  of course  not a disease  per se. It's a condition  or it's a situation that leads to mortality. What you may not realize is just how prevalent it is. There are        suicides each year in the United States. That means one about every    minutes. Third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of    and   . It's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatalities in this country. Now  when we talk about suicide  there is also a medical contribution here  because    percent of suicides are related to a mental illness  depression  bipolar disorder  schizophrenia  anorexia  borderline personality. There's a long list of disorders that contribute  and as I mentioned before  often early in life. But it's not just the mortality from these disorders. It's also morbidity. If you look at disability  as measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the Disability Adjusted Life Years  it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist  except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes  and as you can see  virtually    percent of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders  neuropsychiatric syndromes. You're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense. I mean  cancer seems far more serious. Heart disease seems far more serious. But you can see actually they are further down this list  and that's because we're talking here about disability. What drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression  Why are they number one here  Well  there are probably three reasons. One is that they're highly prevalent. About one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime. A second  of course  is that  for some people  these become truly disabling  and it's about four to five percent  perhaps one in   . But what really drives these numbers  this high morbidity  and to some extent the high mortality  is the fact that these start very early in life. Fifty percent will have onset by age        percent by age     a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease  diabetes  hypertension    most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality. These are  indeed  the chronic disorders of young people. Now  I started by telling you that there were some good news stories. This is obviously not one of them. This is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult  and in a sense this is a kind of confession for me. My job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders. I work for the federal government. Actually  I work for you. You pay my salary. And maybe at this point  when you know what I do  or maybe what I've failed to do  you'll think that I probably ought to be fired  and I could certainly understand that. But what I want to suggest  and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these illnesses. What I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders  diseases of the mind. That's actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days  and people feel that  for whatever reason  it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior. Fair enough. They are disorders of behavior  and they are disorders of the mind. But what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms  which have been in play for a century or more  are actually now impediments to progress  that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders. Now  for some of you  you're going to say   Oh my goodness  here we go again. We're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules  or maybe into some sort of very flat  unidimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia. When we talk about the brain  it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic. It depends  of course  on what scale or what scope you want to think about  but this is an organ of surreal complexity  and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it  whether you're thinking about the     billion neurons that are in the cortex or the     trillion synapses that make up all the connections. We have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports our own minds. It's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough to understand itself. In a sense  it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying behavior or cognition  something you can observe  that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex  mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand. Now  already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about  depression  obsessive compulsive disorder  post traumatic stress disorder  while we don't have an in depth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses  we have been able to already identify some of the connectional differences  or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders. We call this the human connectome  and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain. You'll hear more about this in a few minutes. The important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders  the one in five of us who struggle in some way  you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired  but there are some predictable patterns  and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders. It's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex. Here we're talking about traffic jams  or sometimes detours  or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions. You could  if you want  compare this to  on the one hand  a myocardial infarction  a heart attack  where you have dead tissue in the heart  versus an arrhythmia  where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it. Either one would kill you  in only one of them will you find a major lesion. As we think about this  probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder  and that would be schizophrenia  because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters. These are scans from Judy Rapoport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia  and you can see already in the top there's areas that are red or orange  yellow  are places where there's less gray matter  and as they followed them over five years  comparing them to age match controls  you can see that  particularly in areas like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus  there's a profound loss of gray matter. And it's important  if you try to model this  you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical mass  loss of cortical gray matter  and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that mark  and at some point  when you overshoot  you cross a threshold  and it's that threshold where we say  this is a person who has this disease  because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions. That's something we can observe. But look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold. They've crossed a brain threshold much earlier  that perhaps not at age    or     but even by age    or    you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain  not at the level of behavior. Why does this matter  Well first because  for brain disorders  behavior is the last thing to change. We know that for Alzheimer's  for Parkinson's  for Huntington's. There are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change. The tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier  long before the symptoms emerge. But most important  go back to where we started. The good news stories in medicine are early detection  early intervention. If we waited until the heart attack  we would be sacrificing  .  million lives every year in this country to heart disease. That is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders  brain circuit disorders  has a behavioral disorder. We wait until the behavior becomes manifest. That's not early detection. That's not early intervention. Now to be clear  we're not quite ready to do this. We don't have all the facts. We don't actually even know what the tools will be  nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different. But this tells us how we need to think about it  and where we need to go. Are we going to be there soon  I think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years  but I'd like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who's thought a lot about changes in concepts and changes in technology.  We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next   .     Bill Gates. Thanks very much. One year ago  I rented a car in Jerusalem to go find a man I'd never met but who had changed my life. I didn't have a phone number to call to say I was coming. I didn't have an exact address  but I knew his name  Abed  I knew that he lived in a town of         Kfar Kara  and I knew that     years before  just outside this holy city  he broke my neck. And so  on an overcast morning in January  I headed north off in a silver Chevy to find a man and some peace. The road dropped and I exited Jerusalem. I then rounded the very bend where his blue truck  heavy with four tons of floor tiles  had borne down with great speed onto the back left corner of the minibus where I sat. I was then    years old. I'd grown five inches and done some        pushups in eight months  and the night before the crash  I delighted in my new body  playing basketball with friends into the wee hours of a May morning. I palmed the ball in my large right hand  and when that hand reached the rim  I felt invincible. I was off in the bus to get the pizza I'd won on the court. I didn't see Abed coming. From my seat  I was looking up at a stone town on a hilltop  bright in the noontime sun  when from behind there was a great bang  as loud and violent as a bomb. My head snapped back over my red seat. My eardrum blew. My shoes flew off. I flew too  my head bobbing on broken bones  and when I landed  I was a quadriplegic. Over the coming months  I learned to breathe on my own  then to sit and to stand and to walk  but my body was now divided vertically. I was a hemiplegic  and back home in New York  I used a wheelchair for four years  all through college. College ended and I returned to Jerusalem for a year. There I rose from my chair for good  I leaned on my cane  and I looked back  finding all from my fellow passengers in the bus to photographs of the crash  and when I saw this photograph  I didn't see a bloody and unmoving body. I saw the healthy bulk of a left deltoid  and I mourned that it was lost  mourned all I had not yet done  but was now impossible. It was then I read the testimony that Abed gave the morning after the crash  of driving down the right lane of a highway toward Jerusalem. Reading his words  I welled with anger. It was the first time I'd felt anger toward this man  and it came from magical thinking. On this xeroxed piece of paper  the crash had not yet happened. Abed could still turn his wheel left so that I would see him whoosh by out my window and I would remain whole.  Be careful  Abed  look out. Slow down.  But Abed did not slow  and on that xeroxed piece of paper  my neck again broke  and again  I was left without anger. I decided to find Abed  and when I finally did  he responded to my Hebrew hello which such nonchalance  it seemed he'd been awaiting my phone call. And maybe he had. I didn't mention to Abed his prior driving record       violations by the age of     the last  his not shifting his truck into a low gear on that May day   and I didn't mention my prior record    the quadriplegia and the catheters  the insecurity and the loss   and when Abed went on about how hurt he was in the crash  I didn't say that I knew from the police report that he'd escaped serious injury. I said I wanted to meet. Abed said that I should call back in a few weeks  and when I did  and a recording told me that his number was disconnected  I let Abed and the crash go. Many years passed. I walked with my cane and my ankle brace and a backpack on trips in six continents. I pitched overhand in a weekly softball game that I started in Central Park  and home in New York  I became a journalist and an author  typing hundreds of thousands of words with one finger. A friend pointed out to me that all of my big stories mirrored my own  each centering on a life that had changed in an instant  owing  if not to a crash  then to an inheritance  a swing of the bat  a click of the shutter  an arrest. Each of us had a before and an after. I'd been working through my lot after all. Still  Abed was far from my mind  when last year  I returned to Israel to write of the crash  and the book I then wrote   Half Life   was nearly complete when I recognized that I still wanted to meet Abed  and finally I understood why  to hear this man say two words   I'm sorry.  People apologize for less. And so I got a cop to confirm that Abed still lived somewhere in his same town  and I was now driving to it with a potted yellow rose in the back seat  when suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering. But what to get the man who broke your fucking neck  I pulled into the town of Abu Ghosh  and bought a brick of Turkish delight  pistachios glued in rosewater. Better. Back on Highway    I envisioned what awaited. Abed would hug me. Abed would spit at me. Abed would say   I'm sorry.  I then began to wonder  as I had many times before  how my life would have been different had this man not injured me  had my genes been fed a different helping of experience. Who was I  Was I who I had been before the crash  before this road divided my life like the spine of an open book  Was I what had been done to me  Were all of us the results of things done to us  done for us  the infidelity of a parent or spouse  money inherited  Were we instead our bodies  their inborn endowments and deficits  It seemed that we could be nothing more than genes and experience  but how to tease out the one from the other  As Yeats put that same universal question   O body swayed to music  o brightening glance  how can we know the dancer from the dance   I'd been driving for an hour when I looked in my rearview mirror and saw my own brightening glance. The light my eyes had carried for as long as they had been blue. The predispositions and impulses that had propelled me as a toddler to try and slip over a boat into a Chicago lake  that had propelled me as a teen to jump into wild Cape Cod Bay after a hurricane. But I also saw in my reflection that  had Abed not injured me  I would now  in all likelihood  be a doctor and a husband and a father. I would be less mindful of time and of death  and  oh  I would not be disabled  would not suffer the thousand slings and arrows of my fortune. The frequent furl of five fingers  the chips in my teeth come from biting at all the many things a solitary hand cannot open. The dancer and the dance were hopelessly entwined. It was approaching    when I exited right toward Afula  and passed a large quarry and was soon in Kfar Kara. I felt a pang of nerves. But Chopin was on the radio  seven beautiful mazurkas  and I pulled into a lot by a gas station to listen and to calm. I'd been told that in an Arab town  one need only mention the name of a local and it will be recognized. And I was mentioning Abed and myself  noting deliberately that I was here in peace  to the people in this town  when I met Mohamed outside a post office at noon. He listened to me. You know  it was most often when speaking to people that I wondered where I ended and my disability began  for many people told me what they told no one else. Many cried. And one day  after a woman I met on the street did the same and I later asked her why  she told me that  best she could tell  her tears had had something to do with my being happy and strong  but vulnerable too. I listened to her words. I suppose they were true. I was me  but I was now me despite a limp  and that  I suppose  was what now made me  me. Anyway  Mohamed told me what perhaps he would not have told another stranger. He led me to a house of cream stucco  then drove off. And as I sat contemplating what to say  a woman approached in a black shawl and black robe. I stepped from my car and said  Shalom   and identified myself  and she told me that her husband Abed would be home from work in four hours. Her Hebrew was not good  and she later confessed that she thought that I had come to install the Internet. I drove off and returned at       thankful to the minaret up the road that helped me find my way back. And as I approached the front door  Abed saw me  my jeans and flannel and cane  and I saw Abed  an average looking man of average size. He wore black and white  slippers over socks  pilling sweatpants  a piebald sweater  a striped ski cap pulled down to his forehead. He'd been expecting me. Mohamed had phoned. And so at once  we shook hands  and smiled  and I gave him my gift  and he told me I was a guest in his home  and we sat beside one another on a fabric couch. It was then that Abed resumed at once the tale of woe he had begun over the phone    years before. He'd just had surgery on his eyes  he said. He had problems with his side and his legs too  and  oh  he'd lost his teeth in the crash. Did I wish to see him remove them  Abed then rose and turned on the TV so that I wouldn't be alone when he left the room  and returned with polaroids of the crash and his old driver's license.  I was handsome   he said. We looked down at his laminated mug. Abed had been less handsome than substantial  with thick black hair and a full face and a wide neck. It was this youth who on May           had broken two necks including mine  and bruised one brain and taken one life. Twenty one years later  he was now thinner than his wife  his skin slack on his face  and looking at Abed looking at his young self  I remembered looking at that photograph of my young self after the crash  and recognized his longing.  The crash changed both of our lives   I said. Abed then showed me a picture of his mashed truck  and said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver in the left lane who did not let him pass. I did not want to recap the crash with Abed. I'd hoped for something simpler  to exchange a Turkish dessert for two words and be on my way. And so I didn't point out that in his own testimony the morning after the crash  Abed did not even mention the bus driver. No  I was quiet. I was quiet because I had not come for truth. I had come for remorse. And so I now went looking for remorse and threw truth under the bus.  I understand   I said   that the crash was not your fault  but does it make you sad that others suffered   Abed spoke three quick words.  Yes  I suffered.  Abed then told me why he'd suffered. He'd lived an unholy life before the crash  and so God had ordained the crash  but now  he said  he was religious  and God was pleased. It was then that God intervened  news on the TV of a car wreck that hours before had killed three people up north. We looked up at the wreckage.  Strange   I said.  Strange   he agreed. I had the thought that there  on Route      there were perpetrators and victims  dyads bound by a crash. Some  as had Abed  would forget the date. Some  as had I  would remember. The report finished and Abed spoke.  It is a pity   he said   that the police in this country are not tough enough on bad drivers.  I was baffled. Abed had said something remarkable. Did it point up the degree to which he'd absolved himself of the crash  Was it evidence of guilt  an assertion that he should have been put away longer  He'd served six months in prison  lost his truck license for a decade. I forgot my discretion.  Um  Abed   I said   I thought you had a few driving issues before the crash.   Well   he said   I once went    in a   .  And so    violations    driving through a red light  driving at excessive speed  driving on the wrong side of a barrier  and finally  riding his brakes down that hill    reduced to one. And it was then I understood that no matter how stark the reality  the human being fits it into a narrative that is palatable. The goat becomes the hero. The perpetrator becomes the victim. It was then I understood that Abed would never apologize. Abed and I sat with our coffee. We'd spent    minutes together  and he was now known to me. He was not a particularly bad man or a particularly good man. He was a limited man who'd found it within himself to be kind to me. With a nod to Jewish custom  he told me that I should live to be     years old. But it was hard for me to relate to one who had so completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing  to one whose life was so unexamined that he said he thought two people had died in the crash. There was much I wished to say to Abed. I wished to tell him that  were he to acknowledge my disability  it would be okay  for people are wrong to marvel at those like me who smile as we limp. People don't know that they have lived through worse  that problems of the heart hit with a force greater than a runaway truck  that problems of the mind are greater still  more injurious  than a hundred broken necks. I wished to tell him that what makes most of us who we are most of all is not our minds and not our bodies and not what happens to us  but how we respond to what happens to us.  This   wrote the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl   is the last of the human freedoms  to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.  I wished to tell him that not only paralyzers and paralyzees must evolve  reconcile to reality  but we all must    the aging and the anxious and the divorced and the balding and the bankrupt and everyone. I wished to tell him that one does not have to say that a bad thing is good  that a crash is from God and so a crash is good  a broken neck is good. One can say that a bad thing sucks  but that this natural world still has many glories. I wished to tell him that  in the end  our mandate is clear  We have to rise above bad fortune. We have to be in the good and enjoy the good  study and work and adventure and friendship    oh  friendship    and community and love. But most of all  I wished to tell him what Herman Melville wrote  that  truly to enjoy bodily warmth  some small part of you must be cold  for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast.  Yes  contrast. If you are mindful of what you do not have  you may be truly mindful of what you do have  and if the gods are kind  you may truly enjoy what you have. That is the one singular gift you may receive if you suffer in any existential way. You know death  and so may wake each morning pulsing with ready life. Some part of you is cold  and so another part may truly enjoy what it is to be warm  or even to be cold. When one morning  years after the crash  I stepped onto stone and the underside of my left foot felt the flash of cold  nerves at last awake  it was exhilarating  a gust of snow. But I didn't say these things to Abed. I told him only that he had killed one man  not two. I told him the name of that man. And then I said   Goodbye.  Thank you. Thanks a lot. One of the things I want to establish right from the start is that not all neurosurgeons wear cowboy boots. I just wanted you to know that. So I am indeed a neurosurgeon  and I follow a long tradition of neurosurgery  and what I'm going to tell you about today is adjusting the dials in the circuits in the brain  being able to go anywhere in the brain and turning areas of the brain up or down to help our patients. So as I said  neurosurgery comes from a long tradition. It's been around for about       years. In Mesoamerica  there used to be neurosurgery  and there were these neurosurgeons that used to treat patients. And they were trying to    they knew that the brain was involved in neurological and psychiatric disease. They didn't know exactly what they were doing. Not much has changed  by the way.  Laughter  But they thought that  if you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease  it must be because you are possessed by an evil spirit. So if you are possessed by an evil spirit causing neurologic or psychiatric problems  then the way to treat this is  of course  to make a hole in your skull and let the evil spirit escape. So this was the thinking back then  and these individuals made these holes. Sometimes the patients were a little bit reluctant to go through this because  you can tell that the holes are made partially and then  I think  there was some trepanation  and then they left very quickly and it was only a partial hole  and we know they survived these procedures. But this was common. There were some sites where one percent of all the skulls have these holes  and so you can see that neurologic and psychiatric disease is quite common  and it was also quite common about       years ago. Now  in the course of time  we've come to realize that different parts of the brain do different things. So there are areas of the brain that are dedicated to controlling your movement or your vision or your memory or your appetite  and so on. And when things work well  then the nervous system works well  and everything functions. But once in a while  things don't go so well  and there's trouble in these circuits  and there are some rogue neurons that are misfiring and causing trouble  or sometimes they're underactive and they're not quite working as they should. Now  the manifestation of this depends on where in the brain these neurons are. So when these neurons are in the motor circuit  you get dysfunction in the movement system  and you get things like Parkinson's disease. When the malfunction is in a circuit that regulates your mood  you get things like depression  and when it is in a circuit that controls your memory and cognitive function  then you get things like Alzheimer's disease. So what we've been able to do is to pinpoint where these disturbances are in the brain  and we've been able to intervene within these circuits in the brain to either turn them up or turn them down. So this is very much like choosing the correct station on the radio dial. Once you choose the right station  whether it be jazz or opera  in our case whether it be movement or mood  we can put the dial there  and then we can use a second button to adjust the volume  to turn it up or turn it down. So what I'm going to tell you about is using the circuitry of the brain to implant electrodes and turning areas of the brain up and down to see if we can help our patients. And this is accomplished using this kind of device  and this is called deep brain stimulation. So what we're doing is placing these electrodes throughout the brain. Again  we are making holes in the skull about the size of a dime  putting an electrode in  and then this electrode is completely underneath the skin down to a pacemaker in the chest  and with a remote control very much like a television remote control  we can adjust how much electricity we deliver to these areas of the brain. We can turn it up or down  on or off. Now  about a hundred thousand patients in the world have received deep brain stimulation  and I'm going to show you some examples of using deep brain stimulation to treat disorders of movement  disorders of mood and disorders of cognition. So this looks something like this when it's in the brain. You see the electrode going through the skull into the brain and resting there  and we can place this really anywhere in the brain. I tell my friends that no neuron is safe from a neurosurgeon  because we can really reach just about anywhere in the brain quite safely now. Now the first example I'm going to show you is a patient with Parkinson's disease  and this lady has Parkinson's disease  and she has these electrodes in her brain  and I'm going to show you what she's like when the electrodes are turned off and she has her Parkinson's symptoms  and then we're going to turn it on. So this looks something like this. The electrodes are turned off now  and you can see that she has tremor. We're now going to turn it on. It's on. Just turned it on. And this works like that  instantly. And the difference between shaking in this way and not    The difference between shaking in this way and not is related to the misbehavior of        neurons in her subthalamic nucleus. So we now know how to find these troublemakers and tell them   Gentlemen  that's enough. We want you to stop doing that.  And we do that with electricity. So we use electricity to dictate how they fire  and we try to block their misbehavior using electricity. So in this case  we are suppressing the activity of abnormal neurons. We started using this technique in other problems  and I'm going to tell you about a fascinating problem that we encountered  a case of dystonia. So dystonia is a disorder affecting children. It's a genetic disorder  and it involves a twisting motion  and these children get progressively more and more twisting until they can't breathe  until they get sores  urinary infections  and then they die. So back in       I was asked to see this young boy  perfectly normal. He has this genetic form of dystonia. There are eight children in the family. Five of them have dystonia. So here he is. This boy is nine years old  perfectly normal until the age six  and then he started twisting his body  first the right foot  then the left foot  then the right arm  then the left arm  then the trunk  and then by the time he arrived  within the course of one or two years of the disease onset  he could no longer walk  he could no longer stand. He was crippled  and indeed the natural progression as this gets worse is for them to become progressively twisted  progressively disabled  and many of these children do not survive. So he is one of five kids. The only way he could get around was crawling on his belly like this. He did not respond to any drugs. We did not know what to do with this boy. We did not know what operation to do  where to go in the brain  but on the basis of our results in Parkinson's disease  we reasoned  why don't we try to suppress the same area in the brain that we suppressed in Parkinson's disease  and let's see what happens  So here he was. We operated on him hoping that he would get better. We did not know. So here he is now  back in Israel where he lives  three months after the procedure  and here he is. On the basis of this result  this is now a procedure that's done throughout the world  and there have been hundreds of children that have been helped with this kind of surgery. This boy is now in university and leads quite a normal life. This has been one of the most satisfying cases that I have ever done in my entire career  to restore movement and walking to this kind of child. We realized that perhaps we could use this technology not only in circuits that control your movement but also circuits that control other things  and the next thing that we took on was circuits that control your mood. And we decided to take on depression  and the reason we took on depression is because it's so prevalent  and as you know  there are many treatments for depression  with medication and psychotherapy  even electroconvulsive therapy  but there are millions of people  and there are still    or    percent of patients with depression that do not respond  and it is these patients that we want to help. And let's see if we can use this technique to help these patients with depression. So the first thing we did was  we compared  what's different in the brain of someone with depression and someone who is normal  and what we did was PET scans to look at the blood flow of the brain  and what we noticed is that in patients with depression compared to normals  areas of the brain are shut down  and those are the areas in blue. So here you really have the blues  and the areas in blue are areas that are involved in motivation  in drive and decision making  and indeed  if you're severely depressed as these patients were  those are impaired. You lack motivation and drive. The other thing we discovered was an area that was overactive  area     seen there in red  and area    is the sadness center of the brain. If I make any of you sad  for example  I make you remember the last time you saw your parent before they died or a friend before they died  this area of the brain lights up. It is the sadness center of the brain. And so patients with depression have hyperactivity. The area of the brain for sadness is on red hot. The thermostat is set at     degrees  and the other areas of the brain  involved in drive and motivation  are shut down. So we wondered  can we place electrodes in this area of sadness and see if we can turn down the thermostat  can we turn down the activity  and what will be the consequence of that  So we went ahead and implanted electrodes in patients with depression. This is work done with my colleague Helen Mayberg from Emory. And we placed electrodes in area     and in the top scan you see before the operation  area     the sadness area is red hot  and the frontal lobes are shut down in blue  and then  after three months of continuous stimulation     hours a day  or six months of continuous stimulation  we have a complete reversal of this. We're able to drive down area     down to a more normal level  and we're able to turn back online the frontal lobes of the brain  and indeed we're seeing very striking results in these patients with severe depression. So now we are in clinical trials  and are in Phase III clinical trials  and this may become a new procedure  if it's safe and we find that it's effective  to treat patients with severe depression. I've shown you that we can use deep brain stimulation to treat the motor system in cases of Parkinson's disease and dystonia. I've shown you that we can use it to treat a mood circuit in cases of depression. Can we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter  Anybody interested in that  Of course we can  right  So what we've decided to do is we're going to try to turbocharge the memory circuits in the brain. We're going to place electrodes within the circuits that regulate your memory and cognitive function to see if we can turn up their activity. Now we're not going to do this in normal people. We're going to do this in people that have cognitive deficits  and we've chosen to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease who have cognitive and memory deficits. As you know  this is the main symptom of early onset Alzheimer's disease. So we've placed electrodes within this circuit in an area of the brain called the fornix  which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit  with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory circuit  and whether that can  in turn  help these patients with Alzheimer's disease. Now it turns out that in Alzheimer's disease  there's a huge deficit in glucose utilization in the brain. The brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose. It uses    percent of all your    even though it only weighs two percent    it uses    times more glucose than it should based on its weight. Twenty percent of all the glucose in your body is used by the brain  and as you go from being normal to having mild cognitive impairment  which is a precursor for Alzheimer's  all the way to Alzheimer's disease  then there are areas of the brain that stop using glucose. They shut down. They turn off. And indeed  what we see is that these areas in red around the outside ribbon of the brain are progressively getting more and more blue until they shut down completely. This is analogous to having a power failure in an area of the brain  a regional power failure. So the lights are out in parts of the brain in patients with Alzheimer's disease  and the question is  are the lights out forever  or can we turn the lights back on  Can we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again  So this is what we did. We implanted electrodes in the fornix of patients with Alzheimer's disease  we turned it on  and we looked at what happens to glucose use in the brain. And indeed  at the top  you'll see before the surgery  the areas in blue are the areas that use less glucose than normal  predominantly the parietal and temporal lobes. These areas of the brain are shut down. The lights are out in these areas of the brain. We then put in the DBS electrodes and we wait for a month or a year  and the areas in red represent the areas where we increase glucose utilization. And indeed  we are able to get these areas of the brain that were not using glucose to use glucose once again. So the message here is that  in Alzheimer's disease  the lights are out  but there is someone home  and we're able to turn the power back on to these areas of the brain  and as we do so  we expect that their functions will return. So this is now in clinical trials. We are going to operate on    patients with early Alzheimer's disease to see whether this is safe and effective  whether we can improve their neurologic function. So the message I want to leave you with today is that  indeed  there are several circuits in the brain that are malfunctioning across various disease states  whether we're talking about Parkinson's disease  depression  schizophrenia  Alzheimer's. We are now learning to understand what are the circuits  what are the areas of the brain that are responsible for the clinical signs and the symptoms of those diseases. We can now reach those circuits. We can introduce electrodes within those circuits. We can graduate the activity of those circuits. We can turn them down if they are overactive  if they're causing trouble  trouble that is felt throughout the brain  or we can turn them up if they are underperforming  and in so doing  we think that we may be able to help the overall function of the brain. The implications of this  of course  is that we may be able to modify the symptoms of the disease  but I haven't told you but there's also some evidence that we might be able to help the repair of damaged areas of the brain using electricity  and this is something for the future  to see if  indeed  we not only change the activity but also some of the reparative functions of the brain can be harvested. So I envision that we're going to see a great expansion of indications of this technique. We're going to see electrodes being placed for many disorders of the brain. One of the most exciting things about this is that  indeed  it involves multidisciplinary work. It involves the work of engineers  of imaging scientists  of basic scientists  of neurologists  psychiatrists  neurosurgeons  and certainly at the interface of these multiple disciplines that there's the excitement. And I think that we will see that we will be able to chase more of these evil spirits out from the brain as time goes on  and the consequence of that  of course  will be that we will be able to help many more patients. Thank you very much. When I was    years old  I had low self esteem. I felt I was not talented at anything. One day  I bought a yo yo. When I tried my first trick  it looked like this. I couldn't even do the simplest trick  but it was very natural for me  because I was not dextrous  and hated all sports. But after one week of practicing  my throws became more like this. A bit better. I thought  the yo yo is something for me to be good at  for the first time in my life. I found my passion. I was spending all my time practicing. It took me hours and hours a day to build my skills up to the next level. And then  four years later  when I was    years old  I was standing onstage at the World Yo Yo Contest. And I won. I was so excited.  Yes  I did it  I became a hero. I may get many sponsors  a lot of money  tons of interviews  and be on TV   I thought.  Laughter  But after coming back to Japan  totally nothing changed in my life. I realized society didn't value my passion. So I went back to my college and became a typical Japanese worker as a systems engineer. I felt my passion  heart and soul  had left my body. I felt I was not alive anymore. So I started to consider what I should do  and I thought  I wanted to make my performance better  and to show onstage how spectacular the yo yo could be to change the public's image of the yo yo. So I quit my company and started a career as a professional performer. I started to learn classic ballet  jazz dance  acrobatics and other things to make my performance better. As a result of these efforts  and the help of many others  it happened. I won the World Yo Yo Contest again in the artistic performance division. I passed an audition for Cirque du Soleil. Today  I am standing on the TED stage with the yo yo in front of you. What I learned from the yo yo is  if I make enough effort with huge passion  there is no impossible. Could you let me share my passion with you through my performance  We always hear that texting is a scourge. The idea is that texting spells the decline and fall of any kind of serious literacy  or at least writing ability  among young people in the United States and now the whole world today. The fact of the matter is that it just isn't true  and it's easy to think that it is true  but in order to see it in another way  in order to see that actually texting is a miraculous thing  not just energetic  but a miraculous thing  a kind of emergent complexity that we're seeing happening right now  we have to pull the camera back for a bit and look at what language really is  in which case  one thing that we see is that texting is not writing at all. What do I mean by that  Basically  if we think about language  language has existed for perhaps         years  at least        years  and what it arose as is speech. People talked. That's what we're probably genetically specified for. That's how we use language most. Writing is something that came along much later  and as we saw in the last talk  there's a little bit of controversy as to exactly when that happened  but according to traditional estimates  if humanity had existed for    hours  then writing only came along at about       p.m. That's how much of a latterly thing writing is. So first there's speech  and then writing comes along as a kind of artifice. Now don't get me wrong  writing has certain advantages. When you write  because it's a conscious process  because you can look backwards  you can do things with language that are much less likely if you're just talking. For example  imagine a passage from Edward Gibbon's  The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire    The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours  till the graduate retreat of the Persians was changed into a disorderly flight  of which the shameful example was given by the principal leaders and the Surenas himself.  That's beautiful  but let's face it  nobody talks that way. Or at least  they shouldn't if they're interested in reproducing. That    is not the way any human being speaks casually. Casual speech is something quite different. Linguists have actually shown that when we're speaking casually in an unmonitored way  we tend to speak in word packets of maybe seven to    words. You'll notice this if you ever have occasion to record yourself or a group of people talking. That's what speech is like. Speech is much looser. It's much more telegraphic. It's much less reflective    very different from writing. So we naturally tend to think  because we see language written so often  that that's what language is  but actually what language is  is speech. They are two things. Now of course  as history has gone by  it's been natural for there to be a certain amount of bleed between speech and writing. So  for example  in a distant era now  it was common when one gave a speech to basically talk like writing. So I mean the kind of speech that you see someone giving in an old movie where they clear their throat  and they go   Ahem  ladies and gentlemen   and then they speak in a certain way which has nothing to do with casual speech. It's formal. It uses long sentences like this Gibbon one. It's basically talking like you write  and so  for example  we're thinking so much these days about Lincoln because of the movie. The Gettysburg Address was not the main meal of that event. For two hours before that  Edward Everett spoke on a topic that  frankly  cannot engage us today and barely did then. The point of it was to listen to him speaking like writing. Ordinary people stood and listened to that for two hours. It was perfectly natural. That's what people did then  speaking like writing. Well  if you can speak like writing  then logically it follows that you might want to also sometimes write like you speak. The problem was just that in the material  mechanical sense  that was harder back in the day for the simple reason that materials don't lend themselves to it. It's almost impossible to do that with your hand except in shorthand  and then communication is limited. On a manual typewriter it was very difficult  and even when we had electric typewriters  or then computer keyboards  the fact is that even if you can type easily enough to keep up with the pace of speech  more or less  you have to have somebody who can receive your message quickly. Once you have things in your pocket that can receive that message  then you have the conditions that allow that we can write like we speak. And that's where texting comes in. And so  texting is very loose in its structure. No one thinks about capital letters or punctuation when one texts  but then again  do you think about those things when you talk  No  and so therefore why would you when you were texting  What texting is  despite the fact that it involves the brute mechanics of something that we call writing  is fingered speech. That's what texting is. Now we can write the way we talk. And it's a very interesting thing  but nevertheless easy to think that still it represents some sort of decline. We see this general bagginess of the structure  the lack of concern with rules and the way that we're used to learning on the blackboard  and so we think that something has gone wrong. It's a very natural sense. But the fact of the matter is that what is going on is a kind of emergent complexity. That's what we're seeing in this fingered speech. And in order to understand it  what we want to see is the way  in this new kind of language  there is new structure coming up. And so  for example  there is in texting a convention  which is LOL. Now LOL  we generally think of as meaning  laughing out loud.  And of course  theoretically  it does  and if you look at older texts  then people used it to actually indicate laughing out loud. But if you text now  or if you are someone who is aware of the substrate of texting the way it's become  you'll notice that LOL does not mean laughing out loud anymore. It's evolved into something that is much subtler. This is an actual text that was done by a non male person of about    years old not too long ago.  I love the font you're using  btw.  Julie   lol thanks gmail is being slow right now  Now if you think about it  that's not funny. No one's laughing.  Laughter  And yet  there it is  so you assume there's been some kind of hiccup. Then Susan says  lol  I know   again more guffawing than we're used to when you're talking about these inconveniences. So Julie says   I just sent you an email.  Susan   lol  I see it.  Very funny people  if that's what LOL means. This Julie says   So what's up   Susan   lol  I have to write a    page paper.  She's not amused. Let's think about it. LOL is being used in a very particular way. It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation. We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles. Any spoken language that's used by real people has them. If you happen to speak Japanese  think about that little word  ne  that you use at the end of a lot of sentences. If you listen to the way black youth today speak  think about the use of the word  yo.  Whole dissertations could be written about it  and probably are being written about it. A pragmatic particle  that's what LOL has gradually become. It's a way of using the language between actual people. Another example is  slash.  Now  we can use slash in the way that we're used to  along the lines of   We're going to have a party slash networking session.  That's kind of like what we're at. Slash is used in a very different way in texting among young people today. It's used to change the scene. So for example  this Sally person says   So I need to find people to chill with  and Jake says   Haha     you could write a dissertation about  Haha  too  but we don't have time for that    Haha so you're going by yourself  Why   Sally   For this summer program at NYU.  Jake   Haha. Slash I'm watching this video with suns players trying to shoot with one eye.  The slash is interesting. I don't really even know what Jake is talking about after that  but you notice that he's changing the topic. Now that seems kind of mundane  but think about how in real life  if we're having a conversation and we want to change the topic  there are ways of doing it gracefully. You don't just zip right into it. You'll pat your thighs and look wistfully off into the distance  or you'll say something like   Hmm  makes you think     when it really didn't  but what you're really    what you're really trying to do is change the topic. You can't do that while you're texting  and so ways are developing of doing it within this medium. All spoken languages have what a linguist calls a new information marker    or two  or three. Texting has developed one from this slash. So we have a whole battery of new constructions that are developing  and yet it's easy to think  well  something is still wrong. There's a lack of structure of some sort. It's not as sophisticated as the language of The Wall Street Journal. Well  the fact of the matter is  look at this person in       and this is when texting doesn't exist   I Love Lucy  is still on the air.  Many do not know the alphabet or multiplication table  cannot write grammatically      We've heard that sort of thing before  not just in     .       Connecticut schoolteacher.     . This is the time when we all assume that everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect because the people on  Downton Abbey  are articulate  or something like that. So   From every college in the country goes up the cry  'Our freshmen can't spell  can't punctuate.'  And so on. You can go even further back than this. It's the President of Harvard. It's     . There's no electricity. People have three names.  Bad spelling  incorrectness as well as inelegance of expression in writing.  And he's talking about people who are otherwise well prepared for college studies. You can go even further back.       some long lost superintendent of schools is upset because of what he has for a long time  noted with regret the almost entire neglect of the original  blah blah blah blah blah. Or you can go all the way back to    A.D.     Laughter     and there's this poor man who doesn't like the way people are speaking Latin. As it happens  he was writing about what had become French. And so  there are always    Laughter   Applause    there are always people worrying about these things and the planet somehow seems to keep spinning. And so  the way I'm thinking of texting these days is that what we're seeing is a whole new way of writing that young people are developing  which they're using alongside their ordinary writing skills  and that means that they're able to do two things. Increasing evidence is that being bilingual is cognitively beneficial. That's also true of being bidialectal. That's certainly true of being bidialectal in terms of your writing. And so texting actually is evidence of a balancing act that young people are using today  not consciously  of course  but it's an expansion of their linguistic repertoire. It's very simple. If somebody from      looked at what was on a dormitory message board in       the slang would have changed a little bit since the era of  Love Story   but they would understand what was on that message board. Take that person from         not that long ago  this is  Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure     those people. Take those people and they read a very typical text written by a    year old today. Often they would have no idea what half of it meant because a whole new language has developed among our young people doing something as mundane as what it looks like to us when they're batting around on their little devices. So in closing  if I could go into the future  if I could go into       the first thing I would ask is whether David Simon had done a sequel to  The Wire.  I would want to know. And   I really would ask that   and then I'd want to know actually what was going on on  Downton Abbey.  That'd be the second thing. And then the third thing would be  please show me a sheaf of texts written by    year old girls  because I would want to know where this language had developed since our times  and ideally I would then send them back to you and me now so we could examine this linguistic miracle happening right under our noses. Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  That's how we traveled in the year     . That's an open buggy. It doesn't have heating. It doesn't have air conditioning. That horse is pulling it along at one percent of the speed of sound  and the rutted dirt road turns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains. That's a Boeing    . Only    years later  it travels at    percent of the speed of sound  and we don't travel any faster today because commercial supersonic air travel turned out to be a bust. So I started wondering and pondering  could it be that the best years of American economic growth are behind us  And that leads to the suggestion  maybe economic growth is almost over. Some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial. There are four headwinds that are just hitting the American economy in the face. They're demographics  education  debt and inequality. They're powerful enough to cut growth in half. So we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline. And here's my theme  Because of the headwinds  if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been in the last     years  growth is cut in half. If innovation is less powerful  invents less great  wonderful things  then growth is going to be even lower than half of history. Now here's eight centuries of economic growth. The vertical axis is just percent per year of growth  zero percent a year  one percent a year  two percent a year. The white line is for the U.K.  and then the U.S. takes over as the leading nation in the year       when the line switches to red. You'll notice that  for the first four centuries  there's hardly any growth at all  just  .  percent. Then growth gets better and better. It maxes out in the     s  '  s and '  s  and then it starts slowing down  and here's a cautionary note. That last downward notch in the red line is not actual data. That is a forecast that I made six years ago that growth would slow down to  .  percent. But you know what the actual facts are  You know what the growth in per person income has been in the United States in the last six years  Negative. This led to a fantasy. What if I try to fit a curved line to this historical record  I can make the curved line end anywhere I wanted  but I decided I would end it at  .   just like the U.K. growth for the first four centuries. Now the history that we've achieved is that we've grown at  .  percent per year over the whole period       to       and remember it's been a little bit negative since     . But if growth slows down  instead of doubling our standard of living every generation  Americans in the future can't expect to be twice as well off as their parents  or even a quarter  more well off than  their parents. Now we're going to change and look at the level of per capita income. The vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today's prices. You'll notice that in       over on the left  we were at about       dollars. Today we're at about        dollars of total output per member of the population. Now what if we could achieve that historic two percent growth for the next    years  Well  it's a matter of arithmetic. Two percent growth quadruples your standard of living in    years. That means we'd go from        to        . Well  we're not going to do that  and the reason is the headwinds. The first headwind is demographics. It's a truism that your standard of living rises faster than productivity  rises faster than output per hour  if hours per person increased. And we got that gift back in the '  s and '  s when women entered the labor force. But now it's turned around. Now hours per person are shrinking  first because of the retirement of the baby boomers  and second because there's been a very significant dropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males who are in the bottom half of the educational distribution. The next headwind is education. We've got problems all over our educational system despite Race to the Top. In college  we've got cost inflation in higher education that dwarfs cost inflation in medical care. We have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt  and our college completion rate is    points     percentage points below Canada. We have a lot of debt. Our economy grew from      to      on the back of consumers massively overborrowing. Consumers paying off that debt is one of the main reasons why our economic recovery is so sluggish today. And everybody of course knows that the federal government debt is growing as a share of GDP at a very rapid rate  and the only way that's going to stop is some combination of faster growth in taxes or slower growth in entitlements  also called transfer payments. And that gets us down from the  .   where we've reached for education  down to  . . And then we have inequality. Over the    years before the financial crisis  the growth rate of the bottom    percent of the income distribution was half a point slower than the averages we've been talking about before. All the rest went to the top one percent. So that brings us down to  . . And that  .  is the big challenge. Are we going to grow at  .   If so  that's going to require that our inventions are as important as the ones that happened over the last     years. So let's see what some of those inventions were. If you wanted to read in      at night  you needed to have an oil or a gas lamp. They created pollution  they created odors  they were hard to control  the light was dim  and they were a fire hazard. By       electric light was everywhere. We had the vertical city  the invention of the elevator. Central Manhattan became possible. And then  in addition to that  at the same time  hand tools were replaced by massive electric tools and hand powered electric tools  all achieved by electricity. Electricity was also very helpful in liberating women. Women  back in the late   th century  spent two days a week doing the laundry. They did it on a scrub board. Then they had to hang the clothes out to dry. Then they had to bring them in. The whole thing took two days out of the seven day week. And then we had the electric washing machine. And by       they were everywhere. But the women still had to shop every day  but no they didn't  because electricity brought us the electric refrigerator. Back in the late   th century  the only source of heat in most homes was a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating. The bedrooms were cold. They were unheated. But by       certainly by       we had central heating everywhere. What about the internal combustion engine  which was invented in       In America  before the motor vehicle  transportation depended entirely on the urban horse  which dropped  without restraint     to    pounds of manure on the streets every day together with a gallon of urine. That comes out at five to    tons daily per square mile in cities. Those horses also ate up fully one quarter of American agricultural land. That's the percentage of American agricultural land it took to feed the horses. Of course  when the motor vehicle was invented  and it became almost ubiquitous by       that agricultural land could be used for human consumption or for export. And here's an interesting ratio  Starting from zero in       only    years later  the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households in the United States reached    percent in just    years. Back before the turn of the century  women had another problem. All the water for cooking  cleaning and bathing had to be carried in buckets and pails in from the outside. It's a historical fact that in       the average North Carolina housewife walked     miles a year carrying    tons of water. But by       cities around the country had put in underground water pipes. They had put in underground sewer pipes  and as a result  one of the great scourges of the late   th century  waterborne diseases like cholera  began to disappear. And an amazing fact for techno optimists is that in the first half of the   th century  the rate of improvement of life expectancy was three times faster than it was in the second half of the   th century. So it's a truism that things can't be more than     percent of themselves. And I'll just give you a few examples. We went from one percent to    percent of the speed of sound. Electrification  central heat  ownership of motor cars  they all went from zero to     percent. Urban environments make people more productive than on the farm. We went from    percent urban to    percent by the early postwar years. What about the electronic revolution  Here's an early computer. It's amazing. The mainframe computer was invented in     . By      we had telephone bills  bank statements were being produced by computers. The earliest cell phones  the earliest personal computers were invented in the     s. The     s brought us Bill Gates  DOS  ATM machines to replace bank tellers  bar code scanning to cut down on labor in the retail sector. Fast forward through the '  s  we had the dotcom revolution and a temporary rise in productivity growth. But I'm now going to give you an experiment. You have to choose either option A or option B. Option A is you get to keep everything invented up till    years ago. So you get Google  you get Amazon  you get Wikipedia  and you get running water and indoor toilets. Or you get everything invented to yesterday  including Facebook and your iPhone  but you have to give up  go out to the outhouse  and carry in the water. Hurricane Sandy caused a lot of people to lose the   th century  maybe for a couple of days  in some cases for more than a week  electricity  running water  heating  gasoline for their cars  and a charge for their iPhones. The problem we face is that all these great inventions  we have to match them in the future  and my prediction that we're not going to match them brings us down from the original two percent growth down to  .   the fanciful curve that I drew you at the beginning. So here we are back to the horse and buggy. I'd like to award an Oscar to the inventors of the   th century  the people from Alexander Graham Bell to Thomas Edison to the Wright Brothers  I'd like to call them all up here  and they're going to call back to you. Your challenge is  can you match what we achieved  Thank you. Growth is not dead. Let's start the story     years ago  when American factories began to electrify their operations  igniting the Second Industrial Revolution. The amazing thing is that productivity did not increase in those factories for    years. Thirty years. That's long enough for a generation of managers to retire. You see  the first wave of managers simply replaced their steam engines with electric motors  but they didn't redesign the factories to take advantage of electricity's flexibility. It fell to the next generation to invent new work processes  and then productivity soared  often doubling or even tripling in those factories. Electricity is an example of a general purpose technology  like the steam engine before it. General purpose technologies drive most economic growth  because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations  like lightbulbs and  yes  factory redesign. Is there a general purpose technology of our era  Sure. It's the computer. But technology alone is not enough. Technology is not destiny. We shape our destiny  and just as the earlier generations of managers needed to redesign their factories  we're going to need to reinvent our organizations and even our whole economic system. We're not doing as well at that job as we should be. As we'll see in a moment  productivity is actually doing all right  but it has become decoupled from jobs  and the income of the typical worker is stagnating. These troubles are sometimes misdiagnosed as the end of innovation  but they are actually the growing pains of what Andrew McAfee and I call the new machine age. Let's look at some data. So here's GDP per person in America. There's some bumps along the way  but the big story is you could practically fit a ruler to it. This is a log scale  so what looks like steady growth is actually an acceleration in real terms. And here's productivity. You can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid '  s  but it matches up pretty well with the Second Industrial Revolution  when factories were learning how to electrify their operations. After a lag  productivity accelerated again. So maybe  history doesn't repeat itself  but sometimes it rhymes.  Today  productivity is at an all time high  and despite the Great Recession  it grew faster in the     s than it did in the     s  the roaring     s  and that was faster than the '  s or '  s. It's growing faster than it did during the Second Industrial Revolution. And that's just the United States. The global news is even better. Worldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate in the past decade than ever in history. If anything  all these numbers actually understate our progress  because the new machine age is more about knowledge creation than just physical production. It's mind not matter  brain not brawn  ideas not things. That creates a problem for standard metrics  because we're getting more and more stuff for free  like Wikipedia  Google  Skype  and if they post it on the web  even this TED Talk. Now getting stuff for free is a good thing  right  Sure  of course it is. But that's not how economists measure GDP. Zero price means zero weight in the GDP statistics. According to the numbers  the music industry is half the size that it was    years ago  but I'm listening to more and better music than ever. You know  I bet you are too. In total  my research estimates that the GDP numbers miss over     billion dollars per year in free goods and services on the Internet. Now let's look to the future. There are some super smart people who are arguing that we've reached the end of growth  but to understand the future of growth  we need to make predictions about the underlying drivers of growth. I'm optimistic  because the new machine age is digital  exponential and combinatorial. When goods are digital  they can be replicated with perfect quality at nearly zero cost  and they can be delivered almost instantaneously. Welcome to the economics of abundance. But there's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world. Measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress. In the age of big data  we can measure the world in ways we never could before. Secondly  the new machine age is exponential. Computers get better faster than anything else ever. A child's Playstation today is more powerful than a military supercomputer from     . But our brains are wired for a linear world. As a result  exponential trends take us by surprise. I used to teach my students that there are some things  you know  computers just aren't good at  like driving a car through traffic. That's right  here's Andy and me grinning like madmen because we just rode down Route     in  yes  a driverless car. Thirdly  the new machine age is combinatorial. The stagnationist view is that ideas get used up  like low hanging fruit  but the reality is that each innovation creates building blocks for even more innovations. Here's an example. In just a matter of a few weeks  an undergraduate student of mine built an app that ultimately reached  .  million users. He was able to do that so easily because he built it on top of Facebook  and Facebook was built on top of the web  and that was built on top of the Internet  and so on and so forth. Now individually  digital  exponential and combinatorial would each be game changers. Put them together  and we're seeing a wave of astonishing breakthroughs  like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah or leap tall buildings in a single bound. You know  robots are even revolutionizing cat transportation. But perhaps the most important invention  the most important invention is machine learning. Consider one project  IBM's Watson. These little dots here  those are all the champions on the quiz show  Jeopardy.  At first  Watson wasn't very good  but it improved at a rate faster than any human could  and shortly after Dave Ferrucci showed this chart to my class at MIT  Watson beat the world  Jeopardy  champion. At age seven  Watson is still kind of in its childhood. Recently  its teachers let it surf the Internet unsupervised. The next day  it started answering questions with profanities. Damn.  Laughter  But you know  Watson is growing up fast. It's being tested for jobs in call centers  and it's getting them. It's applying for legal  banking and medical jobs  and getting some of them. Isn't it ironic that at the very moment we are building intelligent machines  perhaps the most important invention in human history  some people are arguing that innovation is stagnating  Like the first two industrial revolutions  the full implications of the new machine age are going to take at least a century to fully play out  but they are staggering. So does that mean we have nothing to worry about  No. Technology is not destiny. Productivity is at an all time high  but fewer people now have jobs. We have created more wealth in the past decade than ever  but for a majority of Americans  their income has fallen. This is the great decoupling of productivity from employment  of wealth from work. You know  it's not surprising that millions of people have become disillusioned by the great decoupling  but like too many others  they misunderstand its basic causes. Technology is racing ahead  but it's leaving more and more people behind. Today  we can take a routine job  codify it in a set of machine readable instructions  and then replicate it a million times. You know  I recently overheard a conversation that epitomizes these new economics. This guy says   Nah  I don't use H R Block anymore. TurboTax does everything that my tax preparer did  but it's faster  cheaper and more accurate.  How can a skilled worker compete with a     piece of software  She can't. Today  millions of Americans do have faster  cheaper  more accurate tax preparation  and the founders of Intuit have done very well for themselves. But    percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs. That is a microcosm of what's happening  not just in software and services  but in media and music  in finance and manufacturing  in retailing and trade    in short  in every industry. People are racing against the machine  and many of them are losing that race. What can we do to create shared prosperity  The answer is not to try to slow down technology. Instead of racing against the machine  we need to learn to race with the machine. That is our grand challenge. The new machine age can be dated to a day    years ago when Garry Kasparov  the world chess champion  played Deep Blue  a supercomputer. The machine won that day  and today  a chess program running on a cell phone can beat a human grandmaster. It got so bad that  when he was asked what strategy he would use against a computer  Jan Donner  the Dutch grandmaster  replied   I'd bring a hammer.  But today a computer is no longer the world chess champion. Neither is a human  because Kasparov organized a freestyle tournament where teams of humans and computers could work together  and the winning team had no grandmaster  and it had no supercomputer. What they had was better teamwork  and they showed that a team of humans and computers  working together  could beat any computer or any human working alone. Racing with the machine beats racing against the machine. Technology is not destiny. We shape our destiny. Thank you. Let's face it  Driving is dangerous. It's one of the things that we don't like to think about  but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms show up on dashboards around the world betrays the fact that we know this to be true. Car accidents are the leading cause of death in people ages    to    in the United States    leading cause of death    and    percent of these accidents have nothing to do with drugs or alcohol. So what happens  No one can say for sure  but I remember my first accident. I was a young driver out on the highway  and the car in front of me  I saw the brake lights go on. I'm like   Okay  all right  this guy is slowing down  I'll slow down too.  I step on the brake. But no  this guy isn't slowing down. This guy is stopping  dead stop  dead stop on the highway. It was just going       to zero  I slammed on the brakes. I felt the ABS kick in  and the car is still going  and it's not going to stop  and I know it's not going to stop  and the air bag deploys  the car is totaled  and fortunately  no one was hurt. But I had no idea that car was stopping  and I think we can do a lot better than that. I think we can transform the driving experience by letting our cars talk to each other. I just want you to think a little bit about what the experience of driving is like now. Get into your car. Close the door. You're in a glass bubble. You can't really directly sense the world around you. You're in this extended body. You're tasked with navigating it down partially seen roadways  in and amongst other metal giants  at super human speeds. Okay  And all you have to guide you are your two eyes. Okay  so that's all you have  eyes that weren't really designed for this task  but then people ask you to do things like  you want to make a lane change  what's the first thing they ask you do  Take your eyes off the road. That's right. Stop looking where you're going  turn  check your blind spot  and drive down the road without looking where you're going. You and everyone else. This is the safe way to drive. Why do we do this  Because we have to  we have to make a choice  do I look here or do I look here  What's more important  And usually we do a fantastic job picking and choosing what we attend to on the road. But occasionally we miss something. Occasionally we sense something wrong or too late. In countless accidents  the driver says   I didn't see it coming.  And I believe that. I believe that. We can only watch so much. But the technology exists now that can help us improve that. In the future  with cars exchanging data with each other  we will be able to see not just three cars ahead and three cars behind  to the right and left  all at the same time  bird's eye view  we will actually be able to see into those cars. We will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us  to see how fast that guy's going or stopping. If that guy's going down to zero  I'll know. And with computation and algorithms and predictive models  we will be able to see the future. You may think that's impossible. How can you predict the future  That's really hard. Actually  no. With cars  it's not impossible. Cars are three dimensional objects that have a fixed position and velocity. They travel down roads. Often they travel on pre published routes. It's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions about where a car's going to be in the near future. Even if  when you're in your car and some motorcyclist comes    bshoom        miles an hour down  lane splitting    I know you've had this experience    that guy didn't  just come out of nowhere.  That guy's been on the road probably for the last half hour. Right  I mean  somebody's seen him. Ten         miles back  someone's seen that guy  and as soon as one car sees that guy and puts him on the map  he's on the map    position  velocity  good estimate he'll continue going    miles an hour. You'll know  because your car will know  because that other car will have whispered something in his ear  like   By the way  five minutes  motorcyclist  watch out.  You can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave. I mean  they're Newtonian objects. That's very nice about them. So how do we get there  We can start with something as simple as sharing our position data between cars  just sharing GPS. If I have a GPS and a camera in my car  I have a pretty precise idea of where I am and how fast I'm going. With computer vision  I can estimate where the cars around me are  sort of  and where they're going. And same with the other cars. They can have a precise idea of where they are  and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are. What happens if two cars share that data  if they talk to each other  I can tell you exactly what happens. Both models improve. Everybody wins. Professor Bob Wang and his team have done computer simulations of what happens when fuzzy estimates combine  even in light traffic  when cars just share GPS data  and we've moved this research out of the computer simulation and into robot test beds that have the actual sensors that are in cars now on these robots  stereo cameras  GPS  and the two dimensional laser range finders that are common in backup systems. We also attach a discrete short range communication radio  and the robots talk to each other. When these robots come at each other  they track each other's position precisely  and they can avoid each other. We're now adding more and more robots into the mix  and we encountered some problems. One of the problems  when you get too much chatter  it's hard to process all the packets  so you have to prioritize  and that's where the predictive model helps you. If your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories  you don't pay as much attention to those packets. You prioritize the one guy who seems to be going a little off course. That guy could be a problem. And you can predict the new trajectory. So you don't only know that he's going off course  you know how. And you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way. And we wanted to do    how can we best alert everyone  How can these cars whisper   You need to get out of the way   Well  it depends on two things  one  the ability of the car  and second the ability of the driver. If one guy has a really great car  but they're on their phone or  you know  doing something  they're not probably in the best position to react in an emergency. So we started a separate line of research doing driver state modeling. And now  using a series of three cameras  we can detect if a driver is looking forward  looking away  looking down  on the phone  or having a cup of coffee. We can predict the accident and we can predict who  which cars  are in the best position to move out of the way to calculate the safest route for everyone. Fundamentally  these technologies exist today. I think the biggest problem that we face is our own willingness to share our data. I think it's a very disconcerting notion  this idea that our cars will be watching us  talking about us to other cars  that we'll be going down the road in a sea of gossip. But I believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy  just like right now  when I look at your car from the outside  I don't really know about you. If I look at your license plate number  I don't really know who you are. I believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs. And I think it's going to be a great thing. I want you to consider for a moment if you really don't want the distracted teenager behind you to know that you're braking  that you're coming to a dead stop. By sharing our data willingly  we can do what's best for everyone. So let your car gossip about you. It's going to make the roads a lot safer. Thank you. I've noticed something interesting about society and culture. Everything risky requires a license. So  learning to drive  owning a gun  getting married. There's a certain    That's true in everything risky  except technology. For some reason  there's no standard syllabus  there's no basic course. They just sort of give you your computer and then kick you out of the nest. You're supposed to learn this stuff    how  Just by osmosis. Nobody ever sits down and tells you   This is how it works.  So today I'm going to tell you ten things that you thought everybody knew  but it turns out they don't. First of all  on the web  if you want to scroll down  don't pick up the mouse and use the scroll bar. That's a terrible waste of time. Do that only if you're paid by the hour. Instead  hit the space bar. The space bar scrolls down one page. Hold down the Shift key to scroll back up again. So  space bar to scroll down one page  works in every browser  in every kind of computer. Also on the web  when you're filling in one of these forms like your addresses  I assume you know that you can hit the Tab key to jump from box to box to box. But what about the pop up menu where you put in your state  Don't open the pop up menu. That's a terrible waste of calories. Type the first letter of your state over and over and over. So if you want Connecticut  go  C  C  C. If you want Texas  go T  T  and you jump right to that thing without even opening the pop up menu. Also on the web  when the text is too small  what you do is hold down the Control key and hit plus  plus  plus. You make the text larger with each tap. Works on every computer  every web browser  or minus  minus  to get smaller again. If you're on the Mac  it might be Command instead. When you're typing on your Blackberry  Android  iPhone  don't bother switching layouts to the punctuation layout to hit the period and then a space  then try to capitalize the next letter. Just hit the space bar twice. The phone puts the period  the space  and the capital for you. Go space  space. It is totally amazing. Also when it comes to cell phones  on all phones  if you want to redial somebody that you've dialed before  all you have to do is hit the call button  and it puts the last phone number into the box for you  and at that point you can hit call again to actually dial it. No need to go to the recent calls list if you're trying to call somebody just hit the call button again. Something that drives me crazy  When I call you and leave a message on your voice mail  I hear you saying   Leave a message   and then I get these    seconds of freaking instructions  like we haven't had answering machines for    years  I'm not bitter. So it turns out there's a keyboard shortcut that lets you jump directly to the beep like this. Phone  At the tone  please... David Pogue  Unfortunately  the carriers didn't adopt the same keystroke  so it's different by carrier  so it devolves upon you to learn the keystroke for the person you're calling. I didn't say these were going to be perfect. So most of you think of Google as something that lets you look up a web page  but it is also a dictionary. Type the word  define  and the word you want to know. You don't even have to click anything. There's the definition as you type. It's also a complete FAA database. Type the name of the airline and the flight. It shows you where the flight is  the gate  the terminal  how long until it lands. You don't need an app. It's also unit and currency conversion. Again  you don't have to click one of the results. Just type it into the box  and there's your answer. While we're talking about text    When you want to highlight    this is just an example    When you want to highlight a word  please don't waste your life dragging across it with the mouse like a newbie. Double click the word. Watch          I go double click  it neatly selects just that word. Also  don't delete what you've highlighted. You can just type over it. This is in every program. Also  you can go double click  drag  to highlight in one word increments as you drag. Much more precise. Again  don't bother deleting. Just type over it. Shutter lag is the time between your pressing the shutter button and the moment the camera actually snaps. It's extremely frustrating on any camera under       . So  that's because the camera needs time to calculate the focus and exposure  but if you pre focus with a half press  leave your finger down    no shutter lag  You get it every time. I've just turned your     camera into a        camera with that trick. And finally  it often happens that you're giving a talk  and for some reason  the audience is looking at the slide instead of at you  So when that happens    this works in Keynote  PowerPoint  it works in every program    all you do is hit the letter B key  B for blackout  to black out the slide  make everybody look at you  and then when you're ready to go on  you hit B again  and if you're really on a roll  you can hit the W key for  whiteout   and you white out the slide  and then you can hit W again to un blank it. So I know I went super fast. If you missed anything  I'll be happy to send you the list of these tips. In the meantime  congratulations. You all get your California Technology License. Have a great day. What you're doing  right now  at this very moment  is killing you. More than cars or the Internet or even that little mobile device we keep talking about  the technology you're using the most almost every day is this  your tush. Nowadays people are sitting  .  hours a day  which is more than we're sleeping  at  .  hours. Sitting is so incredibly prevalent  we don't even question how much we're doing it  and because everyone else is doing it  it doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay. In that way  sitting has become the smoking of our generation. Of course there's health consequences to this  scary ones  besides the waist. Things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical  activity   Ten percent in fact  on both of those. Six percent for heart disease  seven percent for type   diabetes  which is what my father died of. Now  any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more  but if you're anything like me  it won't. What did get me moving was a social interaction. Someone invited me to a meeting  but couldn't manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting  and said   I have to walk my dogs tomorrow. Could you come then   It seemed kind of odd to do  and actually  that first meeting  I remember thinking   I have to be the one to ask the next question   because I knew I was going to huff and puff during this conversation. And yet  I've taken that idea and made it my own. So instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent lit conference room meetings  I ask people to go on a walking meeting  to the tune of    to    miles a week. It's changed my life. But before that  what actually happened was  I used to think about it as  you could take care of your health  or you could take care of obligations  and one always came at the cost of the other. So now  several hundred of these walking meetings later  I've learned a few things. First  there's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out of the box thinking. Whether it's nature or the exercise itself  it certainly works. And second  and probably the more reflective one  is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they're really not that way. And if we're going to solve problems and look at the world really differently  whether it's in governance or business or environmental issues  job creation  maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true. Because it was when that happened with this walk and talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable. So I started this talk talking about the tush  so I'll end with the bottom line  which is  walk and talk. Walk the talk. You'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking  and in the way that you do  you'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas. Thank you. Well  I have a big announcement to make today  and I'm really excited about this. And this may be a little bit of a surprise to many of you who know my research and what I've done well. I've really tried to solve some big problems  counterterrorism  nuclear terrorism  and health care and diagnosing and treating cancer  but I started thinking about all these problems  and I realized that the really biggest problem we face  what all these other problems come down to  is energy  is electricity  the flow of electrons. And I decided that I was going to set out to try to solve this problem. And this probably is not what you're expecting. You're probably expecting me to come up here and talk about fusion  because that's what I've done most of my life. But this is actually a talk about  okay    but this is actually a talk about fission. It's about perfecting something old  and bringing something old into the   st century. Let's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works. In a nuclear power plant  you have a big pot of water that's under high pressure  and you have some fuel rods  and these fuel rods are encased in zirconium  and they're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel  and a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level  and that reaction heats up water  the water turns to steam  steam turns the turbine  and you produce electricity from it. This is the same way we've been producing electricity  the steam turbine idea  for     years  and nuclear was a really big advancement in a way to heat the water  but you still boil water and that turns to steam and turns the turbine. And I thought  you know  is this the best way to do it  Is fission kind of played out  or is there something left to innovate here  And I realized that I had hit upon something that I think has this huge potential to change the world. And this is what it is. This is a small modular reactor. So it's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here. This is between    and     megawatts. But that's a ton of power. That's between  say at an average use  that's maybe        to         homes could run off that. Now the really interesting thing about these reactors is they're built in a factory. So they're modular reactors that are built essentially on an assembly line  and they're trucked anywhere in the world  you plop them down  and they produce electricity. This region right here is the reactor. And this is buried below ground  which is really important. For someone who's done a lot of counterterrorism work  I can't extol to you how great having something buried below the ground is for proliferation and security concerns. And inside this reactor is a molten salt  so anybody who's a fan of thorium  they're going to be really excited about this  because these reactors happen to be really good at breeding and burning the thorium fuel cycle  uranium    . But I'm not really concerned about the fuel. You can run these off    they're really hungry  they really like down blended weapons pits  so that's highly enriched uranium and weapons grade plutonium that's been down blended. It's made into a grade where it's not usable for a nuclear weapon  but they love this stuff. And we have a lot of it sitting around  because this is a big problem. You know  in the Cold War  we built up this huge arsenal of nuclear weapons  and that was great  and we don't need them anymore  and what are we doing with all the waste  essentially  What are we doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons  Well  we're securing them  and it would be great if we could burn them  eat them up  and this reactor loves this stuff. So it's a molten salt reactor. It has a core  and it has a heat exchanger from the hot salt  the radioactive salt  to a cold salt which isn't radioactive. It's still thermally hot but it's not radioactive. And then that's a heat exchanger to what makes this design really  really interesting  and that's a heat exchanger to a gas. So going back to what I was saying before about all power being produced    well  other than photovoltaic    being produced by this boiling of steam and turning a turbine  that's actually not that efficient  and in fact  in a nuclear power plant like this  it's only roughly    to    percent efficient. That's how much thermal energy the reactor's putting out to how much electricity it's producing. And the reason the efficiencies are so low is these reactors operate at pretty low temperature. They operate anywhere from  you know  maybe     to     degrees Celsius. And these reactors run at     to     degrees Celsius  which means the higher the temperature you go to  thermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies. And this reactor doesn't use water. It uses gas  so supercritical CO  or helium  and that goes into a turbine  and this is called the Brayton cycle. This is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity  and this makes this almost    percent efficient  between    and    percent efficiency. And I'm really excited about this  because it's a very compact core. Molten salt reactors are very compact by nature  but what's also great is you get a lot more electricity out for how much uranium you're fissioning  not to mention the fact that these burn up. Their burn up is much higher. So for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor  a lot more of it's being used. And the problem with a traditional nuclear power plant like this is  you've got these rods that are clad in zirconium  and inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets. Well  uranium dioxide's a ceramic  and ceramic doesn't like releasing what's inside of it. So you have what's called the xenon pit  and so some of these fission products love neutrons. They love the neutrons that are going on and helping this reaction take place. And they eat them up  which means that  combined with the fact that the cladding doesn't last very long  you can only run one of these reactors for roughly  say     months without refueling it. So these reactors run for    years without refueling  which is  in my opinion  very  very amazing  because it means it's a sealed system. No refueling means you can seal them up and they're not going to be a proliferation risk  and they're not going to have either nuclear material or radiological material proliferated from their cores. But let's go back to safety  because everybody after Fukushima had to reassess the safety of nuclear  and one of the things when I set out to design a power reactor was it had to be passively and intrinsically safe  and I'm really excited about this reactor for essentially two reasons. One  it doesn't operate at high pressure. So traditional reactors like a pressurized water reactor or boiling water reactor  they're very  very hot water at very high pressures  and this means  essentially  in the event of an accident  if you had any kind of breach of this stainless steel pressure vessel  the coolant would leave the core. These reactors operate at essentially atmospheric pressure  so there's no inclination for the fission products to leave the reactor in the event of an accident. Also  they operate at high temperatures  and the fuel is molten  so they can't melt down  but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances  or you lost off site power in the case of something like Fukushima  there's a dump tank. Because your fuel is liquid  and it's combined with your coolant  you could actually just drain the core into what's called a sub critical setting  basically a tank underneath the reactor that has some neutrons absorbers. And this is really important  because the reaction stops. In this kind of reactor  you can't do that. The fuel  like I said  is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods  and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors  Fukushima and Three Mile Island    looking back at Three Mile Island  we didn't really see this for a while   but these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods  what happens is  when they see high pressure water  steam  in an oxidizing environment  they'll actually produce hydrogen  and that hydrogen has this explosive capability to release fission products. So the core of this reactor  since it's not under pressure and it doesn't have this chemical reactivity  means that there's no inclination for the fission products to leave this reactor. So even in the event of an accident  yeah  the reactor may be toast  which is  you know  sorry for the power company  but we're not going to contaminate large quantities of land. So I really think that in the  say     years it's going to take us to get fusion and make fusion a reality  this could be the source of energy that provides carbon free electricity. Carbon free electricity. And it's an amazing technology because not only does it combat climate change  but it's an innovation. It's a way to bring power to the developing world  because it's produced in a factory and it's cheap. You can put them anywhere in the world you want to. And maybe something else. As a kid  I was obsessed with space. Well  I was obsessed with nuclear science too  to a point  but before that I was obsessed with space  and I was really excited about  you know  being an astronaut and designing rockets  which was something that was always exciting to me. But I think I get to come back to this  because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket that produces    to     megawatts. That is the rocket designer's dream. That's someone who is designing a habitat on another planet's dream. Not only do you have    to     megawatts to power whatever you want to provide propulsion to get you there  but you have power once you get there. You know  rocket designers who use solar panels or fuel cells  I mean a few watts or kilowatts    wow  that's a lot of power. I mean  now we're talking about     megawatts. That's a ton of power. That could power a Martian community. That could power a rocket there. And so I hope that maybe I'll have an opportunity to kind of explore my rocketry passion at the same time that I explore my nuclear passion. And people say   Oh  well  you've launched this thing  and it's radioactive  into space  and what about accidents   But we launch plutonium batteries all the time. Everybody was really excited about Curiosity  and that had this big plutonium battery on board that has plutonium      which actually has a higher specific activity than the low enriched uranium fuel of these molten salt reactors  which means that the effects would be negligible  because you launch it cold  and when it gets into space is where you actually activate this reactor. So I'm really excited. I think that I've designed this reactor here that can be an innovative source of energy  provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications  and I'm really prepared to do this. I graduated high school in May  and    I graduated high school in May  and I decided that I was going to start up a company to commercialize these technologies that I've developed  these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers and these systems to produce medical isotopes  but I want to do this  and I've slowly been building up a team of some of the most incredible people I've ever had the chance to work with  and I'm really prepared to make this a reality. And I think  I think  that looking at the technology  this will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas  and you don't have to refuel it for    years  which is an advantage for the developing world. And I'll just say one more maybe philosophical thing to end with  which is weird for a scientist. But I think there's something really poetic about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars  because the stars are giant fusion reactors. They're giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky. The energy that I'm able to talk to you today  while it was converted to chemical energy in my food  originally came from a nuclear reaction  and so there's something poetic about  in my opinion  perfecting nuclear fission and using it as a future source of innovative energy. So thank you guys.
