Good morning. My name is Eric Li  and I was born here. But no  I wasn't born there. This was where I was born  Shanghai  at the height of the Cultural Revolution. My grandmother tells me that she heard the sound of gunfire along with my first cries. When I was growing up  I was told a story that explained all I ever needed to know about humanity. It went like this. All human societies develop in linear progression  beginning with primitive society  then slave society  feudalism  capitalism  socialism  and finally  guess where we end up  Communism  Sooner or later  all of humanity  regardless of culture  language  nationality  will arrive at this final stage of political and social development. The entire world's peoples will be unified in this paradise on Earth and live happily ever after. But before we get there  we're engaged in a struggle between good and evil  the good of socialism against the evil of capitalism  and the good shall triumph. That  of course  was the meta narrative distilled from the theories of Karl Marx. And the Chinese bought it. We were taught that grand story day in and day out. It became part of us  and we believed in it. The story was a bestseller. About one third of the entire world's population lived under that meta narrative. Then  the world changed overnight. As for me  disillusioned by the failed religion of my youth  I went to America and became a Berkeley hippie. Now  as I was coming of age  something else happened. As if one big story wasn't enough  I was told another one. This one was just as grand. It also claims that all human societies develop in a linear progression towards a singular end. This one went as follows  All societies  regardless of culture  be it Christian  Muslim  Confucian  must progress from traditional societies in which groups are the basic units to modern societies in which atomized individuals are the sovereign units  and all these individuals are  by definition  rational  and they all want one thing  the vote. Because they are all rational  once given the vote  they produce good government and live happily ever after. Paradise on Earth  again. Sooner or later  electoral democracy will be the only political system for all countries and all peoples  with a free market to make them all rich. But before we get there  we're engaged in a struggle between good and evil. The good belongs to those who are democracies and are charged with a mission of spreading it around the globe  sometimes by force  against the evil of those who do not hold elections. who would hold power. Eric X. Li  Now    This story also became a bestseller. According to Freedom House  the number of democracies went from    in      to     in     . In the last    years  Western elites tirelessly trotted around the globe selling this prospectus  Multiple parties fight for political power and everyone voting on them is the only path to salvation to the long suffering developing world. Those who buy the prospectus are destined for success. Those who do not are doomed to fail. But this time  the Chinese didn't buy it. Fool me once... The rest is history. In just    years  China went from one of the poorest agricultural countries in the world to its second largest economy. Six hundred fifty million people were lifted out of poverty. Eighty percent of the entire world's poverty alleviation during that period happened in China. In other words  all the new and old democracies put together amounted to a mere fraction of what a single  one party state did without voting. See  I grew up on this stuff  food stamps. Meat was rationed to a few hundred grams per person per month at one point. Needless to say  I ate all my grandmother's portions. So I asked myself  what's wrong with this picture  Here I am in my hometown  my business growing leaps and bounds. Entrepreneurs are starting companies every day. Middle class is expanding in speed and scale unprecedented in human history. Yet  according to the grand story  none of this should be happening. So I went and did the only thing I could. I studied it. Yes  China is a one party state run by the Chinese Communist Party  the Party  and they don't hold elections. Three assumptions are made by the dominant political theories of our time. Such a system is operationally rigid  politically closed  and morally illegitimate. Well  the assumptions are wrong. The opposites are true. Adaptability  meritocracy  and legitimacy are the three defining characteristics of China's one party system. Now  most political scientists will tell us that a one party system is inherently incapable of self correction. It won't last long because it cannot adapt. Now here are the facts. In    years of running the largest country in the world  the range of the Party's policies has been wider than any other country in recent memory  from radical land collectivization to the Great Leap Forward  then privatization of farmland  then the Cultural Revolution  then Deng Xiaoping's market reform  then successor Jiang Zemin took the giant political step of opening up Party membership to private businesspeople  something unimaginable during Mao's rule. So the Party self corrects in rather dramatic fashions. Institutionally  new rules get enacted to correct previous dysfunctions. For example  term limits. Political leaders used to retain their positions for life  and they used that to accumulate power and perpetuate their rules. Mao was the father of modern China  yet his prolonged rule led to disastrous mistakes. So the Party instituted term limits with mandatory retirement age of    to   . One thing we often hear is   Political reforms have lagged far behind economic reforms   and  China is in dire need of political reform.  But this claim is a rhetorical trap hidden behind a political bias. See  some have decided a priori what kinds of changes they want to see  and only such changes can be called political reform. The truth is  political reforms have never stopped. Compared with    years ago     years  even    years ago  every aspect of Chinese society  how the country is governed  from the most local level to the highest center  are unrecognizable today. Now such changes are simply not possible without political reforms of the most fundamental kind. Now I would venture to suggest the Party is the world's leading expert in political reform. The second assumption is that in a one party state  power gets concentrated in the hands of the few  and bad governance and corruption follow. Indeed  corruption is a big problem  but let's first look at the larger context. Now  this may be counterintuitive to you. The Party happens to be one of the most meritocratic political institutions in the world today. China's highest ruling body  the Politburo  has    members. In the most recent one  only five of them came from a background of privilege  so called princelings. The other     including the president and the premier  came from entirely ordinary backgrounds. In the larger central committee of     or more  the percentage of those who were born into power and wealth was even smaller. The vast majority of senior Chinese leaders worked and competed their way to the top. Compare that with the ruling elites in both developed and developing countries  I think you'll find the Party being near the top in upward mobility. The question then is  how could that be possible in a system run by one party  Now we come to a powerful political institution  little known to Westerners  the Party's Organization Department. The department functions like a giant human resource engine that would be the envy of even some of the most successful corporations. It operates a rotating pyramid made up of three components  civil service  state owned enterprises  and social organizations like a university or a community program. They form separate yet integrated career paths for Chinese officials. They recruit college grads into entry level positions in all three tracks  and they start from the bottom  called  keyuan   clerk . Then they could get promoted through four increasingly elite ranks  fuke  deputy section manager   ke  section manager   fuchu  deputy division manager   and chu  division manger . Now these are not moves from  Karate Kid   okay  It's serious business. The range of positions is wide  from running health care in a village to foreign investment in a city district to manager in a company. Once a year  the department reviews their performance. They interview their superiors  their peers  their subordinates. They vet their personal conduct. They conduct public opinion surveys. Then they promote the winners. Throughout their careers  these cadres can move through and out of all three tracks. Over time  the good ones move beyond the four base levels to the fuju  deputy bureau chief  and ju  bureau chief  levels. There  they enter high officialdom. By that point  a typical assignment will be to manage a district with a population in the millions or a company with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Just to show you how competitive the system is  in       there were         fuke and ke levels          fuchu and chu levels  and only        fuju and ju levels. After the ju levels  the best few move further up several more ranks  and eventually make it to the Central Committee. The process takes two to three decades. Does patronage play a role  Yes  of course. But merit remains the fundamental driver. In essence  the Organization Department runs a modernized version of China's centuries old mentoring system. China's new president  Xi Jinping  is the son of a former leader  which is very unusual  first of his kind to make the top job. Even for him  the career took    years. He started as a village manager  and by the time he entered the Politburo  he had managed areas with a total population of     million people and combined GDPs of  .  trillion U.S. dollars. Now  please don't get me wrong  okay  This is not a put down of anyone. It's just a statement of fact. George W. Bush  remember him  This is not a put down. Before becoming governor of Texas  or Barack Obama before running for president  could not make even a small county manager in China's system. Winston Churchill once said that democracy is a terrible system except for all the rest. Well  apparently he hadn't heard of the Organization Department. Now  Westerners always assume that multi party election with universal suffrage is the only source of political legitimacy. I was asked once   The Party wasn't voted in by election. Where is the source of legitimacy   I said   How about competency   We all know the facts. In       when the Party took power  China was mired in civil wars  dismembered by foreign aggression  average life expectancy at that time     years old. Today  it's the second largest economy in the world  an industrial powerhouse  and its people live in increasing prosperity. Pew Research polls Chinese public attitudes  and here are the numbers in recent years. Satisfaction with the direction of the country     percent. Those who think they're better off than five years ago     percent. Those who expect the future to be better  a whopping    percent. Financial Times polls global youth attitudes  and these numbers  brand new  just came from last week. Ninety three percent of China's Generation Y are optimistic about their country's future. Now  if this is not legitimacy  I'm not sure what is. In contrast  most electoral democracies around the world are suffering from dismal performance. I don't need to elaborate for this audience how dysfunctional it is  from Washington to European capitals. With a few exceptions  the vast number of developing countries that have adopted electoral regimes are still suffering from poverty and civil strife. Governments get elected  and then they fall below    percent approval in a few months and stay there and get worse until the next election. Democracy is becoming a perpetual cycle of elect and regret. At this rate  I'm afraid it is democracy  not China's one party system  that is in danger of losing legitimacy. Now  I don't want to create the misimpression that China's hunky dory  on the way to some kind of superpowerdom. The country faces enormous challenges. The social and economic problems that come with wrenching change like this are mind boggling. Pollution is one. Food safety. Population issues. On the political front  the worst problem is corruption. Corruption is widespread and undermines the system and its moral legitimacy. But most analysts misdiagnose the disease. They say that corruption is the result of the one party system  and therefore  in order to cure it  you have to do away with the entire system. But a more careful look would tell us otherwise. Transparency International ranks China between    and    in recent years among     countries  and it's been moving up. India  the largest democracy in the world     and dropping. For the hundred or so countries that are ranked below China  more than half of them are electoral democracies. So if election is the panacea for corruption  how come these countries can't fix it  Now  I'm a venture capitalist. I make bets. It wouldn't be fair to end this talk without putting myself on the line and making some predictions. So here they are. In the next    years  China will surpass the U.S. and become the largest economy in the world. Income per capita will be near the top of all developing countries. Corruption will be curbed  but not eliminated  and China will move up    to    notches to above    in T.I. ranking. Economic reform will accelerate  political reform will continue  and the one party system will hold firm. We live in the dusk of an era. Meta narratives that make universal claims failed us in the   th century and are failing us in the   st. Meta narrative is the cancer that is killing democracy from the inside. Now  I want to clarify something. I'm not here to make an indictment of democracy. On the contrary  I think democracy contributed to the rise of the West and the creation of the modern world. It is the universal claim that many Western elites are making about their political system  the hubris  that is at the heart of the West's current ills. If they would spend just a little less time on trying to force their way onto others  and a little bit more on political reform at home  they might give their democracy a better chance. China's political model will never supplant electoral democracy  because unlike the latter  it doesn't pretend to be universal. It cannot be exported. But that is the point precisely. The significance of China's example is not that it provides an alternative  but the demonstration that alternatives exist. Let us draw to a close this era of meta narratives. Communism and democracy may both be laudable ideals  but the era of their dogmatic universalism is over. Let us stop telling people and our children there's only one way to govern ourselves and a singular future towards which all societies must evolve. It is wrong. It is irresponsible. And worst of all  it is boring. Let universality make way for plurality. Perhaps a more interesting age is upon us. Are we brave enough to welcome it  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Bruno Giussani  Eric  stay with me for a couple of minutes  because I want to ask you a couple of questions. I think many here  and in general in Western countries  would agree with your statement about analysis of democratic systems becoming dysfunctional  but at the same time  many would kind of find unsettling the thought that there is an unelected authority that  without any form of oversight or consultation  decides what the national interest is. What is the mechanism in the Chinese model that allows people to say  actually  the national interest as you defined it is wrong  EXL  You know  Frank Fukuyama  the political scientist  called the Chinese system  responsive authoritarianism.  It's not exactly right  but I think it comes close. So I know the largest public opinion survey company in China  okay  Do you know who their biggest client is  The Chinese government. Not just from the central government  the city government  the provincial government  to the most local neighborhood districts. They conduct surveys all the time. Are you happy with the garbage collection  Are you happy with the general direction of the country  So there is  in China  there is a different kind of mechanism to be responsive to the demands and the thinking of the people. My point is  I think we should get unstuck from the thinking that there's only one political system    election  election  election    that could make it responsive. I'm not sure  actually  elections produce responsive government anymore in the world. BG  Many seem to agree. One of the features of a democratic system is a space for civil society to express itself. And you have shown figures about the support that the government and the authorities have in China. But then you've just mentioned other elements like  you know  big challenges  and there are  of course  a lot of other data that go in a different direction  tens of thousands of unrests and protests and environmental protests  etc. So you seem to suggest the Chinese model doesn't have a space outside of the Party for civil society to express itself. EXL  There's a vibrant civil society in China  whether it's environment or what have you. But it's different. You wouldn't recognize it. Because  by Western definitions  a so called civil society has to be separate or even in opposition to the political system  but that concept is alien for Chinese culture. For thousands of years  you have civil society  yet they are consistent and coherent and part of a political order  and I think it's a big cultural difference. BG  Eric  thank you for sharing this with TED. EXL  Thank you. There's an old joke about a cop who's walking his beat in the middle of the night  and he comes across a guy under a street lamp who's looking at the ground and moving from side to side  and the cop asks him what he's doing. The guys says he's looking for his keys. So the cop takes his time and looks over and kind of makes a little matrix and looks for about two  three minutes. No keys. The cop says   Are you sure  Hey buddy  are you sure you lost your keys here   And the guy says   No  actually I lost them down at the other end of the street  but the light is better here.  There's a concept that people talk about nowadays called  big data.  And what they're talking about is all of the information that we're generating through our interaction with and over the Internet  everything from Facebook and Twitter to music downloads  movies  streaming  all this kind of stuff  the live streaming of TED. And the folks who work with big data  for them  they talk about that their biggest problem is we have so much information. The biggest problem is  how do we organize all that information  I can tell you that  working in global health  that is not our biggest problem. Because for us  even though the light is better on the Internet  the data that would help us solve the problems we're trying to solve is not actually present on the Internet. So we don't know  for example  how many people right now are being affected by disasters or by conflict situations. We don't know for  really  basically  any of the clinics in the developing world  which ones have medicines and which ones don't. We have no idea of what the supply chain is for those clinics. We don't know    and this is really amazing to me    we don't know how many children were born    or how many children there are    in Bolivia or Botswana or Bhutan. We don't know how many kids died last week in any of those countries. We don't know the needs of the elderly  the mentally ill. For all of these different critically important problems or critically important areas that we want to solve problems in  we basically know nothing at all. And part of the reason why we don't know anything at all is that the information technology systems that we use in global health to find the data to solve these problems is what you see here. This is about a       year old technology. Some of you may have used it before. It's kind of on its way out now  but we still use it for    percent of our stuff. This is a paper form. And what you're looking at is a paper form in the hand of a Ministry of Health nurse in Indonesia  who is tramping out across the countryside in Indonesia on  I'm sure  a very hot and humid day  and she is going to be knocking on thousands of doors over a period of weeks or months  knocking on the doors and saying   Excuse me  we'd like to ask you some questions. Do you have any children  Were your children vaccinated   Because the only way we can actually find out how many children were vaccinated in the country of Indonesia  what percentage were vaccinated  is actually not on the Internet  but by going out and knocking on doors  sometimes tens of thousands of doors. Sometimes it takes months to even years to do something like this. You know  a census of Indonesia would probably take two years to accomplish. And the problem  of course  with all of this is that  with all those paper forms    and I'm telling you  we have paper forms for every possible thing  We have paper forms for vaccination surveys. We have paper forms to track people who come into clinics. We have paper forms to track drug supplies  blood supplies    all these different paper forms for many different topics  they all have a single  common endpoint  and the common endpoint looks something like this. And what we're looking at here is a truckful of data. This is the data from a single vaccination coverage survey in a single district in the country of Zambia from a few years ago  that I participated in. The only thing anyone was trying to find out is what percentage of Zambian children are vaccinated  and this is the data  collected on paper over weeks  from a single district  which is something like a county in the United States. You can imagine that  for the entire country of Zambia  answering just that single question ... looks something like this. Truck after truck after truck  filled with stack after stack after stack of data. And what makes it even worse is that's just the beginning. Because once you've collected all that data  of course  someone    some unfortunate person    is going to have to type that into a computer. When I was a graduate student  I actually was that unfortunate person sometimes. I can tell you  I often wasn't really paying attention. I probably made a lot of mistakes when I did it that no one ever discovered  so data quality goes down. But eventually that data  hopefully  gets typed into a computer  and someone can begin to analyze it  and once they have an analysis and a report  hopefully  then you can take the results of that data collection and use it to vaccinate children better. Because if there's anything worse in the field of global public health    I don't know what's worse than allowing children on this planet to die of vaccine preventable diseases    diseases for which the vaccine costs a dollar. And millions of children die of these diseases every year. And the fact is  millions is a gross estimate  because we don't really know how many kids die each year of this. What makes it even more frustrating is that the data entry part  the part that I used to do as a grad student  can take sometimes six months. Sometimes it can take two years to type that information into a computer  And sometimes  actually not infrequently  it actually never happens. Now try and wrap your head around that for a second. You just had teams of hundreds of people. They went out into the field to answer a particular question. You probably spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on fuel and photocopying and per diem. And then for some reason  momentum is lost or there's no money left  and all of that comes to nothing  because no one actually types it into the computer at all. The process just stops. Happens all the time. This is what we base our decisions on in global health  little data  old data  no data. So back in       I began to think about ways in which we could improve this process. Now         obviously  that was quite a long time ago. It kind of frightens me to think of how long ago that was. The top movie of the year was  Die Hard with a Vengeance.  As you can see  Bruce Willis had a lot more hair back then. I was working in the Centers for Disease Control and I had a lot more hair back then as well. But to me  the most significant thing that I saw in      was this. Hard for us to imagine  but in       this was the ultimate elite mobile device. It wasn't an iPhone. It wasn't a Galaxy phone. It was a PalmPilot. And when I saw the PalmPilot for the first time  I thought   Why can't we put the forms on these PalmPilots  And go out into the field just carrying one PalmPilot  which can hold the capacity of tens of thousands of paper forms  Why don't we try to do that  Because if we can do that  if we can actually just collect the data electronically  digitally  from the very beginning  we can just put a shortcut right through that whole process of typing  of having somebody type that stuff into the computer. We can skip straight to the analysis and then straight to the use of the data to actually save lives.  So that's what I began to do. Working at CDC  I began to travel to different programs around the world and to train them in using PalmPilots to do data collection  instead of using paper. And it actually worked great. It worked exactly as well as anybody would have predicted. What do you know  Digital data collection is actually more efficient than collecting on paper. While I was doing it  my business partner  Rose  who's here with her husband  Matthew  here in the audience  Rose was out doing similar stuff for the American Red Cross. The problem was  after a few years of doing that  I realized    I had been to maybe six or seven programs    and I thought  you know  if I keep this up at this pace  over my whole career  maybe I'm going to go to maybe    or    programs. But the problem is     or    programs  like  training    or    programs to use this technology  that is a tiny drop in the bucket. The demand for this  the need for data to run better programs just within health    not to mention all of the other fields in developing countries    is enormous. There are millions and millions and millions of programs  millions of clinics that need to track drugs  millions of vaccine programs. There are schools that need to track attendance. There are all these different things for us to get the data that we need to do. And I realized if I kept up the way that I was doing  I was basically hardly going to make any impact by the end of my career. And so I began to rack my brain  trying to think about  what was the process that I was doing  How was I training folks  and what were the bottlenecks and what were the obstacles to doing it faster and to doing it more efficiently  And  unfortunately  after thinking about this for some time  I identified the main obstacle. And the main obstacle  it turned out    and this is a sad realization    the main obstacle was me. So what do I mean by that  I had developed a process whereby I was the center of the universe of this technology. If you wanted to use this technology  you had to get in touch with me. That means you had to know I existed. Then you had to find the money to pay for me to fly out to your country and the money to pay for my hotel and my per diem and my daily rate. So you could be talking about     or     or        dollars  if I actually had the time or it fit my schedule and I wasn't on vacation. The point is that anything  any system that depends on a single human being or two or three or five human beings    it just doesn't scale. And this is a problem for which we need to scale this technology  and we need to scale it now. And so I began to think of ways in which I could basically take myself out of the picture. And  you know  I was thinking   How could I take myself out of the picture   for quite some time. I'd been trained that the way you distribute technology within international development is always consultant based. It's always guys that look pretty much like me  flying from countries that look pretty much like this to other countries with people with darker skin. And you go out there  and you spend money on airfare and you spend time and you spend per diem and you spend for a hotel and all that stuff. As far as I knew  that was the only way you could distribute technology  and I couldn't figure out a way around it. But the miracle that happened    I'm going to call it Hotmail for short. You may not think of Hotmail as being miraculous  but for me it was miraculous  because I noticed  just as I was wrestling with this problem    I was working in sub Saharan Africa  mostly  at the time    I noticed that every sub Saharan African health worker that I was working with had a Hotmail account. And it struck me   Wait a minute    I know the Hotmail people surely didn't fly to the Ministry of Health in Kenya to train people in how to use Hotmail. So these guys are distributing technology  getting software capacity out there  but they're not actually flying around the world. I need to think about this more.  While I was thinking about it  people started using even more things like this  just as we were. They started using LinkedIn and Flickr and Gmail and Google Maps    all these things. Of course  all of these things are cloud based and don't require any training. They don't require any programmers. They don't require consultants. Because the business model for all these businesses requires that something be so simple we can use it ourselves  with little or no training. You just have to hear about it and go to the website. And so I thought  what would happen if we built software to do what I'd been consulting in  Instead of training people how to put forms onto mobile devices  let's create software that lets them do it themselves with no training and without me being involved. And that's exactly what we did. So we created software called Magpi  which has an online form creator. No one has to speak to me  you just have to hear about it and go to the website. You can create forms  and once you've created the forms  you push them to a variety of common mobile phones. Obviously  nowadays  we've moved past PalmPilots to mobile phones. And it doesn't have to be a smartphone  it can be a basic phone  like the phone on the right  the basic Symbian phone that's very common in developing countries. And the great part about this is it's just like Hotmail. It's cloud based  and it doesn't require any training  programming  consultants. But there are some additional benefits as well. Now we knew when we built this system  the whole point of it  just like with the PalmPilots  was that you'd be able to collect the data and immediately upload the data and get your data set. But what we found  of course  since it's already on a computer  we can deliver instant maps and analysis and graphing. We can take a process that took two years and compress that down to the space of five minutes. Unbelievable improvements in efficiency. Cloud based  no training  no consultants  no me. And I told you that in the first few years of trying to do this the old fashioned way  going out to each country  we probably trained about       people. What happened after we did this  In the second three years  we had        people find the website  sign up and start using it to collect data  data for disaster response  Canadian pig farmers tracking pig disease and pig herds  people tracking drug supplies. One of my favorite examples  the IRC  International Rescue Committee  they have a program where semi literate midwives  using     mobile phones  send a text message using our software  once a week  with the number of births and the number of deaths  which gives IRC something that no one in global health has ever had  a near real time system of counting babies  of knowing how many kids are born  of knowing how many children there are in Sierra Leone  which is the country where this is happening  and knowing how many children die. Physicians for Human Rights    this is moving a little bit outside the health field    they're basically training people to do rape exams in Congo  where this is an epidemic  a horrible epidemic  and they're using our software to document the evidence they find  including photographically  so that they can bring the perpetrators to justice. Camfed  another charity based out of the UK    Camfed pays girls' families to keep them in school. They understand this is the most significant intervention they can make. They used to track the disbursements  the attendance  the grades  on paper. The turnaround time between a teacher writing down grades or attendance and getting that into a report was about two to three years. Now it's real time. And because this is such a low cost system and based in the cloud  it costs  for the entire five countries that Camfed runs this in  with tens of thousands of girls  the whole cost combined is        dollars a year. That's less than I used to get just traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation. So I told you before that when we were doing it the old fashioned way  I realized all of our work was really adding up to just a drop in the bucket               different programs. We've made a lot of progress  but I recognize that right now  even the work that we've done with        people using this is still a drop in the bucket. But something's changed  and I think it should be obvious. What's changed now is  instead of having a program in which we're scaling at such a slow rate that we can never reach all the people who need us  we've made it unnecessary for people to get reached by us. We've created a tool that lets programs keep kids in school  track the number of babies that are born and the number of babies that die  catch criminals and successfully prosecute them    to do all these different things to learn more about what's going on  to understand more  to see more ... and to save lives and improve lives. Thank you. Throughout the history of computers we've been striving to shorten the gap between us and digital information  the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination can go wild. And this gap has become shorter  shorter  and even shorter  and now this gap is shortened down to less than a millimeter  the thickness of a touch screen glass  and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone. But I wondered  what if there could be no boundary at all  I started to imagine what this would look like. First  I created this tool which penetrates into the digital space  so when you press it hard on the screen  it transfers its physical body into pixels. Designers can materialize their ideas directly in  D  and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen. So with this tool  this boundary has been broken. But our two hands still remain outside the screen. How can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands  At Microsoft Applied Sciences  along with my mentor Cati Boulanger  I redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace. By combining a transparent display and depth cameras for sensing your fingers and face  now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard and reach inside this  D space and grab pixels with your bare hands. Because windows and files have a position in the real space  selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf. Then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines  words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window. Architects can stretch or rotate the models with their two hands directly. So in these examples  we are reaching into the digital world. But how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead  I'm sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online. But now you don't have to worry about it. What I got here is an online augmented fitting room. This is a view that you get from head mounted or see through display when the system understands the geometry of your body. Taking this idea further  I started to think  instead of just seeing these pixels in our space  how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it  What would such a future look like  At MIT Media Lab  along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii and my collaborator Rehmi Post  we created this one physical pixel. Well  in this case  this spherical magnet acts like a  D pixel in our space  which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little  D space. What we did was essentially canceling gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies. And by digitally programming the object  we are liberating the object from constraints of time and space  which means that now  human motions can be recorded and played back and left permanently in the physical world. So choreography can be taught physically over distance and Michael Jordan's famous shooting can be replicated over and over as a physical reality. Students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion  physics  and unlike computer screens or textbooks  this is a real  tangible experience that you can touch and feel  and it's very powerful. And what's more exciting than just turning what's currently in the computer physical is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities. As you can see  the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surroundings without disconnecting ourselves from our world. Today  we started by talking about the boundary  but if we remove this boundary  the only boundary left is our imagination. Thank you. When we talk about corruption  there are typical types of individuals that spring to mind. There's the former Soviet megalomaniacs. Saparmurat Niyazov  he was one of them. Until his death in       he was the all powerful leader of Turkmenistan  a Central Asian country rich in natural gas. Now  he really loved to issue presidential decrees. And one renamed the months of the year including after himself and his mother. He spent millions of dollars creating a bizarre personality cult  and his crowning glory was the building of a    foot high gold plated statue of himself which stood proudly in the capital's central square and rotated to follow the sun. He was a slightly unusual guy. And then there's that clich   the African dictator or minister or official. There's Teodor n Obiang. So his daddy is president for life of Equatorial Guinea  a West African nation that has exported billions of dollars of oil since the     s and yet has a truly appalling human rights record. The vast majority of its people are living in really miserable poverty despite an income per capita that's on a par with that of Portugal. So Obiang junior  well  he buys himself a     million mansion in Malibu  California. I've been up to its front gates. I can tell you it's a magnificent spread. He bought an     million art collection that used to belong to fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent  a stack of fabulous sports cars  some costing a million dollars apiece    oh  and a Gulfstream jet  too. Now get this  Until recently  he was earning an official monthly salary of less than       dollars. And there's Dan Etete. Well  he was the former oil minister of Nigeria under President Abacha  and it just so happens he's a convicted money launderer too. We've spent a great deal of time investigating a    billion    that's right  a    billion   oil deal that he was involved with  and what we found was pretty shocking  but more about that later. So it's easy to think that corruption happens somewhere over there  carried out by a bunch of greedy despots and individuals up to no good in countries that we  personally  may know very little about and feel really unconnected to and unaffected by what might be going on. But does it just happen over there  Well  at     I was very lucky. My first job out of university was investigating the illegal trade in African ivory. And that's how my relationship with corruption really began. In       with two friends who were colleagues  Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley  we set up an organization called Global Witness. Our first campaign was investigating the role of illegal logging in funding the war in Cambodia. So a few years later  and it's now       and I'm in Angola undercover investigating blood diamonds. Perhaps you saw the film  the Hollywood film  Blood Diamond   the one with Leonardo DiCaprio. Well  some of that sprang from our work. Luanda  it was full of land mine victims who were struggling to survive on the streets and war orphans living in sewers under the streets  and a tiny  very wealthy elite who gossiped about shopping trips to Brazil and Portugal. And it was a slightly crazy place. So I'm sitting in a hot and very stuffy hotel room feeling just totally overwhelmed. But it wasn't about blood diamonds. Because I'd been speaking to lots of people there who  well  they talked about a different problem  that of a massive web of corruption on a global scale and millions of oil dollars going missing. And for what was then a very small organization of just a few people  trying to even begin to think how we might tackle that was an enormous challenge. And in the years that I've been  and we've all been campaigning and investigating  I've repeatedly seen that what makes corruption on a global  massive scale possible  well it isn't just greed or the misuse of power or that nebulous phrase  weak governance.  I mean  yes  it's all of those  but corruption  it's made possible by the actions of global facilitators. So let's go back to some of those people I talked about earlier. Now  they're all people we've investigated  and they're all people who couldn't do what they do alone. Take Obiang junior. Well  he didn't end up with high end art and luxury houses without help. He did business with global banks. A bank in Paris held accounts of companies controlled by him  one of which was used to buy the art  and American banks  well  they funneled    million dollars into the States  some of which was used to buy that California mansion. And he didn't do all of this in his own name either. He used shell companies. He used one to buy the property  and another  which was in somebody else's name  to pay the huge bills it cost to run the place. And then there's Dan Etete. Well  when he was oil minister  he awarded an oil block now worth over a billion dollars to a company that  guess what  yeah  he was the hidden owner of. Now  it was then much later traded on with the kind assistance of the Nigerian government    now I have to be careful what I say here   to subsidiaries of Shell and the Italian Eni  two of the biggest oil companies around. So the reality is  is that the engine of corruption  well  it exists far beyond the shores of countries like Equatorial Guinea or Nigeria or Turkmenistan. This engine  well  it's driven by our international banking system  by the problem of anonymous shell companies  and by the secrecy that we have afforded big oil  gas and mining operations  and  most of all  by the failure of our politicians to back up their rhetoric and do something really meaningful and systemic to tackle this stuff. Now let's take the banks first. Well  it's not going to come as any surprise for me to tell you that banks accept dirty money  but they prioritize their profits in other destructive ways too. For example  in Sarawak  Malaysia. Now this region  it has just five percent of its forests left intact. Five percent. So how did that happen  Well  because an elite and its facilitators have been making millions of dollars from supporting logging on an industrial scale for many years. So we sent an undercover investigator in to secretly film meetings with members of the ruling elite  and the resulting footage  well  it made some people very angry  and you can see that on YouTube  but it proved what we had long suspected  because it showed how the state's chief minister  despite his later denials  used his control over land and forest licenses to enrich himself and his family. And HSBC  well  we know that HSBC bankrolled the region's largest logging companies that were responsible for some of that destruction in Sarawak and elsewhere. The bank violated its own sustainability policies in the process  but it earned around     million dollars. Now shortly after our expos   very shortly after our expos  earlier this year  the bank announced a policy review on this. And is this progress  Maybe  but we're going to be keeping a very close eye on that case. And then there's the problem of anonymous shell companies. Well  we've all heard about what they are  I think  and we all know they're used quite a bit by people and companies who are trying to avoid paying their proper dues to society  also known as taxes. But what doesn't usually come to light is how shell companies are used to steal huge sums of money  transformational sums of money  from poor countries. In virtually every case of corruption that we've investigated  shell companies have appeared  and sometimes it's been impossible to find out who is really involved in the deal. A recent study by the World Bank looked at     cases of corruption. It found that over    percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies  totaling almost    billion dollars. Now many of these companies were in America or the United Kingdom  its overseas territories and Crown dependencies  and so it's not just an offshore problem  it's an on shore one too. You see  shell companies  they're central to the secret deals which may benefit wealthy elites rather than ordinary citizens. One striking recent case that we've investigated is how the government in the Democratic Republic of Congo sold off a series of valuable  state owned mining assets to shell companies in the British Virgin Islands. So we spoke to sources in country  trawled through company documents and other information trying to piece together a really true picture of the deal. And we were alarmed to find that these shell companies had quickly flipped many of the assets on for huge profits to major international mining companies listed in London. Now  the Africa Progress Panel  led by Kofi Annan  they've calculated that Congo may have lost more than  .  billion dollars from these deals. That's almost twice the country's annual health and education budget combined. And will the people of Congo  will they ever get their money back  Well  the answer to that question  and who was really involved and what really happened  well that's going to probably remain locked away in the secretive company registries of the British Virgin Islands and elsewhere unless we all do something about it. And how about the oil  gas and mining companies  Okay  maybe it's a bit of a clich  to talk about them. Corruption in that sector  no surprise. There's corruption everywhere  so why focus on that sector  Well  because there's a lot at stake. In       natural resource exports outweighed aid flows by almost    to one in Africa  Asia and Latin America. Nineteen to one. Now that's a hell of a lot of schools and universities and hospitals and business startups  many of which haven't materialized and never will because some of that money has simply been stolen away. Now let's go back to the oil and mining companies  and let's go back to Dan Etete and that    billion deal. And now forgive me  I'm going to read the next bit because it's a very live issue  and our lawyers have been through this in some detail and they want me to get it right. Now  on the surface  the deal appeared straightforward. Subsidiaries of Shell and Eni paid the Nigerian government for the block. The Nigerian government transferred precisely the same amount  to the very dollar  to an account earmarked for a shell company whose hidden owner was Etete. Now  that's not bad going for a convicted money launderer. And here's the thing. After many months of digging around and reading through hundreds of pages of court documents  we found evidence that  in fact  Shell and Eni had known that the funds would be transferred to that shell company  and frankly  it's hard to believe they didn't know who they were really dealing with there. Now  it just shouldn't take these sorts of efforts to find out where the money in deals like this went. I mean  these are state assets. They're supposed to be used for the benefit of the people in the country. But in some countries  citizens and journalists who are trying to expose stories like this have been harassed and arrested and some have even risked their lives to do so. And finally  well  there are those who believe that corruption is unavoidable. It's just how some business is done. It's too complex and difficult to change. So in effect  what  We just accept it. But as a campaigner and investigator  I have a different view  because I've seen what can happen when an idea gains momentum. In the oil and mining sector  for example  there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transparency standard that could tackle some of these problems. In       when Global Witness called for oil companies to make payments on deals transparent  well  some people laughed at the extreme naivet  of that small idea. But literally hundreds of civil society groups from around the world came together to fight for transparency  and now it's fast becoming the norm and the law. Two thirds of the value of the world's oil and mining companies are now covered by transparency laws. Two thirds. So this is change happening. This is progress. But we're not there yet  by far. Because it really isn't about corruption somewhere over there  is it  In a globalized world  corruption is a truly globalized business  and one that needs global solutions  supported and pushed by us all  as global citizens  right here. Thank you. This is my grandfather. And this is my son. My grandfather taught me to work with wood when I was a little boy  and he also taught me the idea that if you cut down a tree to turn it into something  honor that tree's life and make it as beautiful as you possibly can. My little boy reminded me that for all the technology and all the toys in the world  sometimes just a small block of wood  if you stack it up tall  actually is an incredibly inspiring thing. These are my buildings. I build all around the world out of our office in Vancouver and New York. And we build buildings of different sizes and styles and different materials  depending on where we are. But wood is the material that I love the most  and I'm going to tell you the story about wood. And part of the reason I love it is that every time people go into my buildings that are wood  I notice they react completely differently. I've never seen anybody walk into one of my buildings and hug a steel or a concrete column  but I've actually seen that happen in a wood building. I've actually seen how people touch the wood  and I think there's a reason for it. Just like snowflakes  no two pieces of wood can ever be the same anywhere on Earth. That's a wonderful thing. I like to think that wood gives Mother Nature fingerprints in our buildings. It's Mother Nature's fingerprints that make our buildings connect us to nature in the built environment. Now  I live in Vancouver  near a forest that grows to    stories tall. Down the coast here in California  the redwood forest grows to    stories tall. But the buildings that we think about in wood are only four stories tall in most places on Earth. Even building codes actually limit the ability for us to build much taller than four stories in many places  and that's true here in the United States. Now there are exceptions  but there needs to be some exceptions  and things are going to change  I'm hoping. And the reason I think that way is that today half of us live in cities  and that number is going to grow to    percent. Cities and density mean that our buildings are going to continue to be big  and I think there's a role for wood to play in cities. And I feel that way because three billion people in the world today  over the next    years  will need a new home. That's    percent of the world that are going to need a new building built for them in the next    years. Now  one in three people living in cities today actually live in a slum. That's one billion people in the world live in slums. A hundred million people in the world are homeless. The scale of the challenge for architects and for society to deal with in building is to find a solution to house these people. But the challenge is  as we move to cities  cities are built in these two materials  steel and concrete  and they're great materials. They're the materials of the last century. But they're also materials with very high energy and very high greenhouse gas emissions in their process. Steel represents about three percent of man's greenhouse gas emissions  and concrete is over five percent. So if you think about that  eight percent of our contribution to greenhouse gases today comes from those two materials alone. We don't think about it a lot  and unfortunately  we actually don't even think about buildings  I think  as much as we should. This is a U.S. statistic about the impact of greenhouse gases. Almost half of our greenhouse gases are related to the building industry  and if we look at energy  it's the same story. You'll notice that transportation's sort of second down that list  but that's the conversation we mostly hear about. And although a lot of that is about energy  it's also so much about carbon. The problem I see is that  ultimately  the clash of how we solve that problem of serving those three billion people that need a home  and climate change  are a head on collision about to happen  or already happening. That challenge means that we have to start thinking in new ways  and I think wood is going to be part of that solution  and I'm going to tell you the story of why. As an architect  wood is the only material  big material  that I can build with that's already grown by the power of the sun. When a tree grows in the forest and gives off oxygen and soaks up carbon dioxide  and it dies and it falls to the forest floor  it gives that carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere or into the ground. If it burns in a forest fire  it's going to give that carbon back to the atmosphere as well. But if you take that wood and you put it into a building or into a piece of furniture or into that wooden toy  it actually has an amazing capacity to store the carbon and provide us with a sequestration. One cubic meter of wood will store one tonne of carbon dioxide. Now our two solutions to climate are obviously to reduce our emissions and find storage. Wood is the only major material building material I can build with that actually does both those two things. So I believe that we have an ethic that the Earth grows our food  and we need to move to an ethic in this century that the Earth should grow our homes. Now  how are we going to do that when we're urbanizing at this rate and we think about wood buildings only at four stories  We need to reduce the concrete and steel and we need to grow bigger  and what we've been working on is    story tall buildings made of wood. We've been engineering them with an engineer named Eric Karsh who works with me on it  and we've been doing this new work because there are new wood products out there for us to use  and we call them mass timber panels. These are panels made with young trees  small growth trees  small pieces of wood glued together to make panels that are enormous  eight feet wide     feet long  and of various thicknesses. The way I describe this best  I've found  is to say that we're all used to two by four construction when we think about wood. That's what people jump to as a conclusion. Two by four construction is sort of like the little eight dot bricks of Lego that we all played with as kids  and you can make all kinds of cool things out of Lego at that size  and out of two by fours. But do remember when you were a kid  and you kind of sifted through the pile in your basement  and you found that big    dot brick of Lego  and you were kind of like   Cool  this is awesome. I can build something really big  and this is going to be great.  That's the change. Mass timber panels are those    dot bricks. They're changing the scale of what we can do  and what we've developed is something we call FFTT  which is a Creative Commons solution to building a very flexible system of building with these large panels where we tilt up six stories at a time if we want to. This animation shows you how the building goes together in a very simple way  but these buildings are available for architects and engineers now to build on for different cultures in the world  different architectural styles and characters. In order for us to build safely  we've engineered these buildings  actually  to work in a Vancouver context  where we're a high seismic zone  even at    stories tall. Now obviously  every time I bring this up  people even  you know  here at the conference  say   Are you serious  Thirty stories  How's that going to happen   And there's a lot of really good questions that are asked and important questions that we spent quite a long time working on the answers to as we put together our report and the peer reviewed report. I'm just going to focus on a few of them  and let's start with fire  because I think fire is probably the first one that you're all thinking about right now. Fair enough. And the way I describe it is this. If I asked you to take a match and light it and hold up a log and try to get that log to go on fire  it doesn't happen  right  We all know that. But to build a fire  you kind of start with small pieces of wood and you work your way up  and eventually you can add the log to the fire  and when you do add the log to the fire  of course  it burns  but it burns slowly. Well  mass timber panels  these new products that we're using  are much like the log. It's hard to start them on fire  and when they do  they actually burn extraordinarily predictably  and we can use fire science in order to predict and make these buildings as safe as concrete and as safe as steel. The next big issue  deforestation. Eighteen percent of our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide is the result of deforestation. The last thing we want to do is cut down trees. Or  the last thing we want to do is cut down the wrong trees. There are models for sustainable forestry that allow us to cut trees properly  and those are the only trees appropriate to use for these kinds of systems. Now I actually think that these ideas will change the economics of deforestation. In countries with deforestation issues  we need to find a way to provide better value for the forest and actually encourage people to make money through very fast growth cycles                 year old trees that make these products and allow us to build at this scale. We've calculated a    story building  We'll grow enough wood in North America every    minutes. That's how much it takes. The carbon story here is a really good one. If we built a    story building out of cement and concrete  the process would result in the manufacturing of that cement and       tonnes of carbon dioxide. If we did it in wood  in this solution  we'd sequester about       tonnes  for a net difference of       tonnes. That's the equivalent of about     cars removed from the road in one year. Think back to that three billion people that need a new home  and maybe this is a contributor to reducing. We're at the beginning of a revolution  I hope  in the way we build  because this is the first new way to build a skyscraper in probably     years or more. But the challenge is changing society's perception of possibility  and it's a huge challenge. The engineering is  truthfully  the easy part of this. And the way I describe it is this. The first skyscraper  technically    and the definition of a skyscraper is    stories tall  believe it or not   but the first skyscraper was this one in Chicago  and people were terrified to walk underneath this building. But only four years after it was built  Gustave Eiffel was building the Eiffel Tower  and as he built the Eiffel Tower  he changed the skylines of the cities of the world  changed and created a competition between places like New York City and Chicago  where developers started building bigger and bigger buildings and pushing the envelope up higher and higher with better and better engineering. We built this model in New York  actually  as a theoretical model on the campus of a technical university soon to come  and the reason we picked this site to just show you what these buildings may look like  because the exterior can change. It's really just the structure that we're talking about. The reason we picked it is because this is a technical university  and I believe that wood is the most technologically advanced material I can build with. It just happens to be that Mother Nature holds the patent  and we don't really feel comfortable with it. But that's the way it should be  nature's fingerprints in the built environment. I'm looking for this opportunity to create an Eiffel Tower moment  we call it. Buildings are starting to go up around the world. There's a building in London that's nine stories  a new building that just finished in Australia that I believe is    or   . We're starting to push the height up of these wood buildings  and we're hoping  and I'm hoping  that my hometown of Vancouver actually potentially announces the world's tallest at around    stories in the not so distant future. That Eiffel Tower moment will break the ceiling  these arbitrary ceilings of height  and allow wood buildings to join the competition. And I believe the race is ultimately on. Thank you. Diana Reiss  You may think you're looking through a window at a dolphin spinning playfully  but what you're actually looking through is a two way mirror at a dolphin looking at itself spinning playfully. This is a dolphin that is self aware. This dolphin has self awareness. It's a young dolphin named Bayley. I've been very interested in understanding the nature of the intelligence of dolphins for the past    years. How do we explore intelligence in this animal that's so different from us  And what I've used is a very simple research tool  a mirror  and we've gained great information  reflections of these animal minds. Dolphins aren't the only animals  the only non human animals  to show mirror self recognition. We used to think this was a uniquely human ability  but we learned that the great apes  our closest relatives  also show this ability. Then we showed it in dolphins  and then later in elephants. We did this work in my lab with the dolphins and elephants  and it's been recently shown in the magpie. Now  it's interesting  because we've embraced this Darwinian view of a continuity in physical evolution  this physical continuity. But we've been much more reticent  much slower at recognizing this continuity in cognition  in emotion  in consciousness in other animals. Other animals are conscious. They're emotional. They're aware. There have been multitudes of studies with many species over the years that have given us exquisite evidence for thinking and consciousness in other animals  other animals that are quite different than we are in form. We are not alone. We are not alone in these abilities. And I hope  and one of my biggest dreams  is that  with our growing awareness about the consciousness of others and our relationship with the rest of the animal world  that we'll give them the respect and protection that they deserve. So that's a wish I'm throwing out here for everybody  and I hope I can really engage you in this idea. Now  I want to return to dolphins  because these are the animals that I feel like I've been working up closely and personal with for over    years. And these are real personalities. They are not persons  but they're personalities in every sense of the word. And you can't get more alien than the dolphin. They are very different from us in body form. They're radically different. They come from a radically different environment. In fact  we're separated by    million years of divergent evolution. Look at this body. And in every sense of making a pun here  these are true non terrestrials. I wondered how we might interface with these animals. In the     s  I developed an underwater keyboard. This was a custom made touch screen keyboard. What I wanted to do was give the dolphins choice and control. These are big brains  highly social animals  and I thought  well  if we give them choice and control  if they can hit a symbol on this keyboard    and by the way  it was interfaced by fiber optic cables from Hewlett Packard with an Apple II computer. This seems prehistoric now  but this was where we were with technology. So the dolphins could hit a key  a symbol  they heard a computer generated whistle  and they got an object or activity. Now here's a little video. This is Delphi and Pan  and you're going to see Delphi hitting a key  he hears a computer generated whistle     Whistle     and gets a ball  so they can actually ask for things they want. What was remarkable is  they explored this keyboard on their own. There was no intervention on our part. They explored the keyboard. They played around with it. They figured out how it worked. And they started to quickly imitate the sounds they were hearing on the keyboard. They imitated on their own. Beyond that  though  they started learning associations between the symbols  the sounds and the objects. What we saw was self organized learning  and now I'm imagining  what can we do with new technologies  How can we create interfaces  new windows into the minds of animals  with the technologies that exist today  So I was thinking about this  and then  one day  I got a call from Peter. Peter Gabriel  I make noises for a living. On a good day  it's music  and I want to talk a little bit about the most amazing music making experience I ever had. I'm a farm boy. I grew up surrounded by animals  and I would look in these eyes and wonder what was going on there  So as an adult  when I started to read about the amazing breakthroughs with Penny Patterson and Koko  with Sue Savage Rumbaugh and Kanzi  Panbanisha  Irene Pepperberg  Alex the parrot  I got all excited. What was amazing to me also was they seemed a lot more adept at getting a handle on our language than we were on getting a handle on theirs. I work with a lot of musicians from around the world  and often we don't have any common language at all  but we sit down behind our instruments  and suddenly there's a way for us to connect and emote. So I started cold calling  and eventually got through to Sue Savage Rumbaugh  and she invited me down. I went down  and the bonobos had had access to percussion instruments  musical toys  but never before to a keyboard. At first they did what infants do  just bashed it with their fists  and then I asked  through Sue  if Panbanisha could try with one finger only. Sue Savage Rumbaugh  Can you play a grooming song  I want to hear a grooming song. Play a real quiet grooming song. PG  So groom was the subject of the piece. So I'm just behind  jamming  yeah  this is what we started with. Sue's encouraging her to continue a little more. She discovers a note she likes  finds the octave. She'd never sat at a keyboard before. Nice triplets. SSR  You did good. That was very good. PG  She hit good. So that night  we began to dream  and we thought  perhaps the most amazing tool that man's created is the Internet  and what would happen if we could somehow find new interfaces  visual audio interfaces that would allow these remarkable sentient beings that we share the planet with access  And Sue Savage Rumbaugh got excited about that  called her friend Steve Woodruff  and we began hustling all sorts of people whose work related or was inspiring  which led us to Diana  and led us to Neil. Neil Gershenfeld  Thanks  Peter. PG  Thank you. NG  So Peter approached me. I lost it when I saw that clip. He approached me with a vision of doing these things not for people  for animals. And then I was struck in the history of the Internet. This is what the Internet looked like when it was born and you can call that the Internet of middle aged white men  mostly middle aged white men. Vint Cerf   Laughs  NG  Speaking as one. Then  when I first came to TED  which was where I met Peter  I showed this. This is a    web server  and at the time that was radical. And the possibility of making a web server for a dollar grew into what became known as the Internet of Things  which is literally an industry now with tremendous implications for health care  energy efficiency. And we were happy with ourselves. And then when Peter showed me that  I realized we had missed something  which is the rest of the planet. So we started up this interspecies Internet project. Now we started talking with TED about how you bring dolphins and great apes and elephants to TED  and we realized that wouldn't work. So we're going to bring you to them. So if we could switch to the audio from this computer  we've been video conferencing with cognitive animals  and we're going to have each of them just briefly introduce them. And so if we could also have this up  great. So the first site we're going to meet is Cameron Park Zoo in Waco  with orangutans. In the daytime they live outside. It's nighttime there now. So can you please go ahead  Terri Cox  Hi  I'm Terri Cox with the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco  Texas  and with me I have KeraJaan and Mei  two of our Bornean orangutans. During the day  they have a beautiful  large outdoor habitat  and at night  they come into this habitat  into their night quarters  where they can have a climate controlled and secure environment to sleep in. We participate in the Apps for Apes program Orangutan Outreach  and we use iPads to help stimulate and enrich the animals  and also help raise awareness for these critically endangered animals. And they share    percent of our DNA and are incredibly intelligent  so it's so exciting to think of all the opportunities that we have via technology and the Internet to really enrich their lives and open up their world. We're really excited about the possibility of an interspecies Internet  and K.J. has been enjoying the conference very much. NG  That's great. When we were rehearsing last night  he had fun watching the elephants. Next user group are the dolphins at the National Aquarium. Please go ahead. Allison Ginsburg  Good evening. Well  my name is Allison Ginsburg  and we're live in Baltimore at the National Aquarium. Joining me are three of our eight Atlantic bottlenose dolphins     year old Chesapeake  who was our first dolphin born here  her four year old daughter Bayley  and her half sister     year old Maya. Now  here at the National Aquarium we are committed to excellence in animal care  to research  and to conservation. The dolphins are pretty intrigued as to what's going on here tonight. They're not really used to having cameras here at   o'clock at night. In addition  we are very committed to doing different types of research. As Diana mentioned  our animals are involved in many different research studies. NG  Those are for you. Okay  that's great  thank you. And the third user group  in Thailand  is Think Elephants. Go ahead  Josh. Josh Plotnik  Hi  my name is Josh Plotnik  and I'm with Think Elephants International  and we're here in the Golden Triangle of Thailand with the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation elephants. And we have    elephants here  and our research is focused on the evolution of intelligence with elephants  but our foundation Think Elephants is focused on bringing elephants into classrooms around the world virtually like this and showing people how incredible these animals are. So we're able to bring the camera right up to the elephant  put food into the elephant's mouth  show people what's going on inside their mouths  and show everyone around the world how incredible these animals really are. NG  Okay  that's great. Thanks Josh. And once again  we've been building great relationships among them just since we've been rehearsing. So at that point  if we can go back to the other computer  we were starting to think about how you integrate the rest of the biomass of the planet into the Internet  and we went to the best possible person I can think of  which is Vint Cerf  who is one of the founders who gave us the Internet. Vint  VC  Thank you  Neil. A long time ago in a galaxy   oops  wrong script. Forty years ago  Bob Kahn and I did the design of the Internet. Thirty years ago  we turned it on. Just last year  we turned on the production Internet. You've been using the experimental version for the last    years. The production version  it uses IP version  . It has  .  times    to the   th possible terminations. That's a number only that Congress can appreciate. But it leads to what is coming next. When Bob and I did this design  we thought we were building a system to connect computers together. What we very quickly discovered is that this was a system for connecting people together. And what you've seen tonight tells you that we should not restrict this network to one species  that these other intelligent  sentient species should be part of the system too. This is the system as it looks today  by the way. This is what the Internet looks like to a computer that's trying to figure out where the traffic is supposed to go. This is generated by a program that's looking at the connectivity of the Internet  and how all the various networks are connected together. There are about         networks  interconnected  run independently by         different operating agencies  and the only reason this works is that they all use the same standard TCP IP protocols. Well  you know where this is headed. The Internet of Things tell us that a lot of computer enabled appliances and devices are going to become part of this system too  appliances that you use around the house  that you use in your office  that you carry around with yourself or in the car. That's the Internet of Things that's coming. Now  what's important about what these people are doing is that they're beginning to learn how to communicate with species that are not us but share a common sensory environment. We're beginning to explore what it means to communicate with something that isn't just another person. Well  you can see what's coming next. All kinds of possible sentient beings may be interconnected through this system  and I can't wait to see these experiments unfold. What happens after that  Well  let's see. There are machines that need to talk to machines and that we need to talk to  and so as time goes on  we're going to have to learn how to communicate with computers and how to get computers to communicate with us in the way that we're accustomed to  not with keyboards  not with mice  but with speech and gestures and all the natural human language that we're accustomed to. So we'll need something like C PO to become a translator between ourselves and some of the other machines we live with. Now  there is a project that's underway called the interplanetary Internet. It's in operation between Earth and Mars. It's operating on the International Space Station. It's part of the spacecraft that's in orbit around the Sun that's rendezvoused with two planets. So the interplanetary system is on its way  but there's a last project  which the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  which funded the original ARPANET  funded the Internet  funded the interplanetary architecture  is now funding a project to design a spacecraft to get to the nearest star in     years' time. What that means is that what we're learning with these interactions with other species will teach us  ultimately  how we might interact with an alien from another world. I can hardly wait. June Cohen  So first of all  thank you  and I would like to acknowledge that four people who could talk to us for full four days actually managed to stay to four minutes each  and we thank you for that. I have so many questions  but maybe a few practical things that the audience might want to know. You're launching this idea here at TED   PG  Today. JC  Today. This is the first time you're talking about it. Tell me a little bit about where you're going to take the idea. What's next  PG  I think we want to engage as many people here as possible in helping us think of smart interfaces that will make all this possible. NG  And just mechanically  there's a     c     and web infrastructure and all of that  but it's not quite ready to turn on  so we'll roll that out  and contact us if you want the information on it. The idea is this will be    much like the Internet functions as a network of networks  which is Vint's core contribution  this will be a wrapper around all of these initiatives  that are wonderful individually  to link them globally. JC  Right  and do you have a web address that we might look for yet  NG  Shortly. JC  Shortly. We will come back to you on that. And very quickly  just to clarify. Some people might have looked at the video that you showed and thought  well  that's just a webcam. What's special about it  If you could talk for just a moment about how you want to go past that  NG  So this is scalable video infrastructure  not for a few to a few but many to many  so that it scales to symmetrical video sharing and content sharing across these sites around the planet. So there's a lot of back end signal processing  not for one to many  but for many to many. JC  Right  and then on a practical level  which technologies are you looking at first  I know you mentioned that a keyboard is a really key part of this. DR  We're trying to develop an interactive touch screen for dolphins. This is sort of a continuation of some of the earlier work  and we just got our first seed money today towards that  so it's our first project. JC  Before the talk  even. DR  Yeah. JC  Wow. Well done. All right  well thank you all so much for joining us. It's such a delight to have you on the stage. DR  Thank you. VC  Thank you. Have you ever experienced a moment in your life that was so painful and confusing  that all you wanted to do was learn as much as you could to make sense of it all  When I was     a close family friend who was like an uncle to me passed away from pancreatic cancer. When the disease hit so close to home  I knew I needed to learn more. So I went online to find answers. Using the Internet  I found a variety of statistics on pancreatic cancer  and what I had found shocked me. Over    percent of all pancreatic cancers are diagnosed late  when someone has less than a two percent chance of survival. Why are we so bad at detecting pancreatic cancer  The reason  Today's current  modern  medicine is a    year old technique. That's older than my dad. But also  it's extremely expensive  costing     dollars per test  and it's grossly inaccurate  missing    percent of all pancreatic cancers. Your doctor would have to be ridiculously suspicious that you have the cancer in order to give you this test. Learning this  I knew there had to be a better way. So  I set up scientific criteria as to what a sensor would have to look like in order to effectively diagnose pancreatic cancer. The sensor would have to be  inexpensive  rapid  simple  sensitive  selective  and minimally invasive. Now  there's a reason why this test hasn't been updated in over six decades. And that's because when we're looking for pancreatic cancer  we're looking at your bloodstream  which is already abundant in all these tons and tons of protein  and you're looking for this miniscule difference in this tiny amount of protein. Just this one protein. That's next to impossible. However  undeterred due to my teenage optimism    I went online to a teenager's two best friends  Google and Wikipedia. I got everything for my homework from those two sources. And what I had found was an article that listed a database of over       different proteins that are found when you have pancreatic cancer. So  I decided to go and make it my new mission to go through all these proteins  and see which ones could serve as a bio marker for pancreatic cancer. And to make it a bit simpler for myself  I decided to map out scientific criteria  and here it is. Essentially  first  the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers  at high levels in the bloodstream  in the earliest stages  but also only in cancer. And so I'm just plugging and chugging through this gargantuan task  and finally  on the      th try  when I'm close to losing my sanity  I find the protein. And the name of the protein I'd located was called mesothelin  and it's just your ordinary  run of the mill type protein  unless  of course  you have pancreatic  ovarian or lung cancer  in which case it's found at these very high levels in your bloodstream. But also  the key is that it's found in the earliest stages of the disease  when someone has close to     percent chance of survival. So now that I'd found a reliable protein I could detect  I then shifted my focus to actually detecting that protein  and thus  pancreatic cancer. Now  my breakthrough came in a very unlikely place  possibly the most unlikely place for innovation    my high school biology class  the absolute stifler of innovation. And I had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes  and that's just a long  thin pipe of carbon that's an atom thick  and one       th the diameter of your hair. And despite their extremely small sizes  they have these incredible properties. They're kind of like the superheroes of material science. And while I was sneakily reading this article under my desk in my biology class  we were supposed to be paying attention to these other kind of cool molecules  called antibodies. And these are pretty cool because they only react with one specific protein  but they're not nearly as interesting as carbon nanotubes. And so then  I was sitting in class  and suddenly it hit me  I could combine what I was reading about  carbon nanotubes  with what I was supposed to be thinking about  antibodies. Essentially  I could weave a bunch of these antibodies into a network of carbon nanotubes  such that you have a network that only reacts with one protein  but also  due to the properties of these nanotubes  it will change its electrical properties  based on the amount of protein present. However  there's a catch. These networks of carbon nanotubes are extremely flimsy. And since they're so delicate  they need to be supported. So that's why I chose to use paper. Making a cancer sensor out of paper is about as simple as making chocolate chip cookies  which I love. You start with some water  pour in some nanotubes  add antibodies  mix it up  take some paper  dip it  dry it  and you can detect cancer. Then  suddenly  a thought occurred that kind of put a blemish on my amazing plan here. I can't really do cancer research on my kitchen countertop. My mom wouldn't really like that. So instead  I decided to go for a lab. So I typed up a budget  a materials list  a timeline  and a procedure  and I emailed it to     different professors at Johns Hopkins University and the National Institutes of Health    essentially  anyone that had anything to do with pancreatic cancer. I sat back waiting for these positive emails to be pouring in  saying   You're a genius  You're going to save us all   And    Then reality took hold  and over the course of a month  I got     rejections out of those     emails. One professor even went through my entire procedure  painstakingly    I'm not really sure where he got all this time    and he went through and said why each and every step was like the worst mistake I could ever make. Clearly  the professors did not have as high of an opinion of my work as I did. However  there is a silver lining. One professor said   Maybe I might be able to help you  kid.  So  I went in that direction. As you can never say no to a kid. And so then  three months later  I finally nailed down a harsh deadline with this guy  and I get into his lab  I get all excited  and then I sit down  I start opening my mouth and talking  and five seconds later  he calls in another Ph.D. Ph.D.s just flock into this little room  and they're just firing these questions at me  and by the end  I kind of felt like I was in a clown car. There were    Ph.D.s  plus me and the professor crammed into this tiny office space  with them firing these rapid fire questions at me  trying to sink my procedure. How unlikely is that  I mean  pshhh. However  subjecting myself to that interrogation    I answered all their questions  and I guessed on quite a few but I got them right    and I finally landed the lab space I needed. But it was shortly afterwards that I discovered my once brilliant procedure had something like a million holes in it  and over the course of seven months  I painstakingly filled each and every one of those holes. The result  One small paper sensor that costs three cents and takes five minutes to run. This makes it     times faster  over        times less expensive  and over     times more sensitive than our current standard for pancreatic cancer detection. One of the best parts of the sensor  though  is that it has close to     percent accuracy  and can detect the cancer in the earliest stages  when someone has close to     percent chance of survival. And so in the next two to five years  this sensor could potentially lift the pancreatic cancer survival rates from a dismal  .  percent to close to     percent  and it would do similar for ovarian and lung cancer. But it wouldn't stop there. By switching out that antibody  you can look at a different protein  thus  a different disease    potentially any disease in the entire world. So that ranges from heart disease  to malaria  HIV  AIDS  as well as other forms of cancer    anything. And so  hopefully one day  we can all have that one extra uncle  that one mother  that one brother  sister  we can have that one more family member to love. And that our hearts will be rid of that one disease burden that comes from pancreatic  ovarian and lung cancer  and potentially any disease. But through the Internet  anything is possible. Theories can be shared  and you don't have to be a professor with multiple degrees to have your ideas valued. It's a neutral space  where what you look like  age or gender    it doesn't matter. It's just your ideas that count. For me  it's all about looking at the Internet in an entirely new way  to realize that there's so much more to it than just posting duck face pictures of yourself online. You could be changing the world. So if a    year old who didn't even know what a pancreas was could find a new way to detect pancreatic cancer    just imagine what you could do. Thank you. I'd like to talk to you today about a whole new way to think about sexual activity and sexuality education  by comparison. If you talk to someone today in America about sexual activity  you'll find pretty soon you're not just talking about sexual activity. You're also talking about baseball. Because baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor that Americans use to think about and talk about sexual activity  and we know that because there's all this language in English that seems to be talking about baseball but that's really talking about sexual activity. So  for example  you can be a pitcher or a catcher  and that corresponds to whether you perform a sexual act or receive a sexual act. Of course  there are the bases  which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order  ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run  which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm  at least for the guy. You can strike out  which means you don't get to have any sexual activity. And if you're a benchwarmer  you might be a virgin or somebody who for whatever reason isn't in the game  maybe because of your age or because of your ability or because of your skillset. A bat's a penis  and a nappy dugout is a vulva  or a vagina. A glove or a catcher's mitt is a condom. A switch hitter is a bisexual person  and we gay and lesbian folks play for the other team. And then there's this one   if there's grass on the field  play ball.  And that usually refers to if a young person  specifically often a young woman  is old enough to have pubic hair  she's old enough to have sex with. This baseball model is incredibly problematic. It's sexist. It's heterosexist. It's competitive. It's goal directed. And it can't result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults. So we need a new model. I'm here today to offer you that new model. And it's based on pizza. Now pizza is something that is universally understood and that most people associate with a positive experience. So let's do this. Let's take baseball and pizza and compare it when talking about three aspects of sexual activity  the trigger for sexual activity  what happens during sexual activity  and the expected outcome of sexual activity. So when do you play baseball  You play baseball when it's baseball season and when there's a game on the schedule. It's not exactly your choice. So if it's prom night or a wedding night or at a party or if our parents aren't home  hey  it's just batter up. Can you imagine saying to your coach   Uh  I'm not really feeling it today  I think I'll sit this game out.  That's just not the way it happens. And when you get together to play baseball  immediately you're with two opposing teams  one playing offense  one playing defense  somebody's trying to move deeper into the field. That's usually a sign to the boy. Somebody's trying to defend people moving into the field. That's often given to the girl. It's competitive. We're not playing with each other. We're playing against each other. And when you show up to play baseball  nobody needs to talk about what we're going to do or how this baseball game might be good for us. Everybody knows the rules. You just take your position and play the game. But when do you have pizza  Well  you have pizza when you're hungry for pizza. It starts with an internal sense  an internal desire  or a need.  Huh. I could go for some pizza.  And because it's an internal desire  we actually have some sense of control over that. I could decide that I'm hungry but know that it's not a great time to eat. And then when we get together with someone for pizza  we're not competing with them  we're looking for an experience that both of us will share that's satisfying for both of us  and when you get together for pizza with somebody  what's the first thing you do  You talk about it. You talk about what you want. You talk about what you like. You may even negotiate it.  How do you feel about pepperoni    Laughter   Not so much  I'm kind of a mushroom guy myself.   Well  maybe we can go half and half.  And even if you've had pizza with somebody for a very long time  don't you still say things like   Should we get the usual    Or maybe something a little more adventurous   Okay  so when you're playing baseball  so if we talk about during sexual activity  when you're playing baseball  you're just supposed to round the bases in the proper order one at a time. You can't hit the ball and run to right field. That doesn't work. And you also can't get to second base and say   I like it here. I'm going to stay here.  No. And also  of course  with baseball  there's  like  the specific equipment and a specific skill set. Not everybody can play baseball. It's pretty exclusive. Okay  but what about pizza  When we're trying to figure out what's good for pizza  isn't it all about what's our pleasure  There are a million different kinds of pizza. There's a million different toppings. There's a million different ways to eat pizza. And none of them are wrong. They're different. And in this case  difference is good  because that's going to increase the chance that we're having a satisfying experience. And lastly  what's the expected outcome of baseball  Well  in baseball  you play to win. You score as many runs as you can. There's always a winner in baseball  and that means there's always a loser in baseball. But what about pizza  Well  in pizza  we're not really    there's no winning. How do you win pizza  You don't. But you do look for   Are we satisfied   And sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or on different days. And we get to decide when we feel satisfied. If we're still hungry  we might have some more. If you eat too much  though  you just feel gross. So what if we could take this pizza model and overlay it on top of sexuality education  A lot of sexuality education that happens today is so influenced by the baseball model  and it sets up education that can't help but produce unhealthy sexuality in young people. And those young people become older people. But if we could create sexuality education that was more like pizza  we could create education that invites people to think about their own desires  to make deliberate decisions about what they want  to talk about it with their partners  and to ultimately look for not some external outcome but for what feels satisfying  and we get to decide that. You may have noticed in the baseball and pizza comparison  under the baseball  it's all commands. They're all exclamation points. But under the pizza model  they're questions. And who gets to answer those questions  You do. I do. So remember  when we're thinking about sexuality education and sexual activity  baseball  you're out. Pizza is the way to think about healthy  satisfying sexual activity  and good  comprehensive sexuality education. Thank you very much for your time. When I first began recording wild soundscapes    years ago  I had no idea that ants  insect larvae  sea anemones and viruses created a sound signature. But they do. And so does every wild habitat on the planet  like the Amazon rainforest you're hearing behind me. In fact  temperate and tropical rainforests each produce a vibrant animal orchestra  that instantaneous and organized expression of insects  reptiles  amphibians  birds and mammals. And every soundscape that springs from a wild habitat generates its own unique signature  one that contains incredible amounts of information  and it's some of that information I want to share with you today. The soundscape is made up of three basic sources. The first is the geophony  or the nonbiological sounds that occur in any given habitat  like wind in the trees  water in a stream  waves at the ocean shore  movement of the Earth. The second of these is the biophony. The biophony is all of the sound that's generated by organisms in a given habitat at one time and in one place. And the third is all of the sound that we humans generate that's called anthrophony. Some of it is controlled  like music or theater  but most of it is chaotic and incoherent  which some of us refer to as noise. There was a time when I considered wild soundscapes to be a worthless artifact. They were just there  but they had no significance. Well  I was wrong. What I learned from these encounters was that careful listening gives us incredibly valuable tools by which to evaluate the health of a habitat across the entire spectrum of life. When I began recording in the late '  s  the typical methods of recording were limited to the fragmented capture of individual species like birds mostly  in the beginning  but later animals like mammals and amphibians. To me  this was a little like trying to understand the magnificence of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony by abstracting the sound of a single violin player out of the context of the orchestra and hearing just that one part. Fortunately  more and more institutions are implementing the more holistic models that I and a few of my colleagues have introduced to the field of soundscape ecology. When I began recording over four decades ago  I could record for    hours and capture one hour of usable material  good enough for an album or a film soundtrack or a museum installation. Now  because of global warming  resource extraction  and human noise  among many other factors  it can take up to       hours or more to capture the same thing. Fully    percent of my archive comes from habitats so radically altered that they're either altogether silent or can no longer be heard in any of their original form. The usual methods of evaluating a habitat have been done by visually counting the numbers of species and the numbers of individuals within each species in a given area. However  by comparing data that ties together both density and diversity from what we hear  I'm able to arrive at much more precise fitness outcomes. And I want to show you some examples that typify the possibilities unlocked by diving into this universe. This is Lincoln Meadow. Lincoln Meadow's a three and a half hour drive east of San Francisco in the Sierra Nevada Mountains  at about       meters altitude  and I've been recording there for many years. In       a logging company convinced local residents that there would be absolutely no environmental impact from a new method they were trying called  selective logging   taking out a tree here and there rather than clear cutting a whole area. With permission granted to record both before and after the operation  I set up my gear and captured a large number of dawn choruses to very strict protocol and calibrated recordings  because I wanted a really good baseline. This is an example of a spectrogram. A spectrogram is a graphic illustration of sound with time from left to right across the page       seconds in this case is represented   and frequency from the bottom of the page to the top  lowest to highest. And you can see that the signature of a stream is represented here in the bottom third or half of the page  while birds that were once in that meadow are represented in the signature across the top. There were a lot of them. And here's Lincoln Meadow before selective logging. Well  a year later I returned  and using the same protocols and recording under the same conditions  I recorded a number of examples of the same dawn choruses  and now this is what we've got. This is after selective logging. You can see that the stream is still represented in the bottom third of the page  but notice what's missing in the top two thirds. Coming up is the sound of a woodpecker. Well  I've returned to Lincoln Meadow    times in the last    years  and I can tell you that the biophony  the density and diversity of that biophony  has not yet returned to anything like it was before the operation. But here's a picture of Lincoln Meadow taken after  and you can see that from the perspective of the camera or the human eye  hardly a stick or a tree appears to be out of place  which would confirm the logging company's contention that there's nothing of environmental impact. However  our ears tell us a very different story. Young students are always asking me what these animals are saying  and really I've got no idea. But I can tell you that they do express themselves. Whether or not we understand it is a different story. I was walking along the shore in Alaska  and I came across this tide pool filled with a colony of sea anemones  these wonderful eating machines  relatives of coral and jellyfish. And curious to see if any of them made any noise  I dropped a hydrophone  an underwater microphone covered in rubber  down the mouth part  and immediately the critter began to absorb the microphone into its belly  and the tentacles were searching out of the surface for something of nutritional value. The static like sounds that are very low  that you're going to hear right now. Yeah  but watch. When it didn't find anything to eat    I think that's an expression that can be understood in any language. At the end of its breeding cycle  the Great Basin Spadefoot toad digs itself down about a meter under the hard panned desert soil of the American West  where it can stay for many seasons until conditions are just right for it to emerge again. And when there's enough moisture in the soil in the spring  frogs will dig themselves to the surface and gather around these large  vernal pools in great numbers. And they vocalize in a chorus that's absolutely in sync with one another. And they do that for two reasons. The first is competitive  because they're looking for mates  and the second is cooperative  because if they're all vocalizing in sync together  it makes it really difficult for predators like coyotes  foxes and owls to single out any individual for a meal. This is a spectrogram of what the frog chorusing looks like when it's in a very healthy pattern. Mono Lake is just to the east of Yosemite National Park in California  and it's a favorite habitat of these toads  and it's also favored by U.S. Navy jet pilots  who train in their fighters flying them at speeds exceeding       kilometers an hour and altitudes only a couple hundred meters above ground level of the Mono Basin  very fast  very low  and so loud that the anthrophony  the human noise  even though it's six and a half kilometers from the frog pond you just heard a second ago  it masked the sound of the chorusing toads. You can see in this spectrogram that all of the energy that was once in the first spectrogram is gone from the top end of the spectrogram  and that there's breaks in the chorusing at two and a half  four and a half  and six and a half seconds  and then the sound of the jet  the signature  is in yellow at the very bottom of the page. Now at the end of that flyby  it took the frogs fully    minutes to regain their chorusing synchronicity  during which time  and under a full moon  we watched as two coyotes and a great horned owl came in to pick off a few of their numbers. The good news is that  with a little bit of habitat restoration and fewer flights  the frog populations  once diminishing during the     s and early '  s  have pretty much returned to normal. I want to end with a story told by a beaver. It's a very sad story  but it really illustrates how animals can sometimes show emotion  a very controversial subject among some older biologists. A colleague of mine was recording in the American Midwest around this pond that had been formed maybe        years ago at the end of the last ice age. It was also formed in part by a beaver dam at one end that held that whole ecosystem together in a very delicate balance. And one afternoon  while he was recording  there suddenly appeared from out of nowhere a couple of game wardens  who for no apparent reason  walked over to the beaver dam  dropped a stick of dynamite down it  blowing it up  killing the female and her young babies. Horrified  my colleagues remained behind to gather his thoughts and to record whatever he could the rest of the afternoon  and that evening  he captured a remarkable event  the lone surviving male beaver swimming in slow circles crying out inconsolably for its lost mate and offspring. This is probably the saddest sound I've ever heard coming from any organism  human or other. Yeah. Well. There are many facets to soundscapes  among them the ways in which animals taught us to dance and sing  which I'll save for another time. But you have heard how biophonies help clarify our understanding of the natural world. You've heard the impact of resource extraction  human noise and habitat destruction. And where environmental sciences have typically tried to understand the world from what we see  a much fuller understanding can be got from what we hear. Biophonies and geophonies are the signature voices of the natural world  and as we hear them  we're endowed with a sense of place  the true story of the world we live in. In a matter of seconds  a soundscape reveals much more information from many perspectives  from quantifiable data to cultural inspiration. Visual capture implicitly frames a limited frontal perspective of a given spatial context  while soundscapes widen that scope to a full     degrees  completely enveloping us. And while a picture may be worth       words  a soundscape is worth       pictures. And our ears tell us that the whisper of every leaf and creature speaks to the natural sources of our lives  which indeed may hold the secrets of love for all things  especially our own humanity  and the last word goes to a jaguar from the Amazon. Thank you for listening. Clouds. Have you ever noticed how much people moan about them  They get a bad rap. If you think about it  the English language has written into it negative associations towards the clouds. Someone who's down or depressed  they're under a cloud. And when there's bad news in store  there's a cloud on the horizon. I saw an article the other day. It was about problems with computer processing over the Internet.  A cloud over the cloud   was the headline. It seems like they're everyone's default doom and gloom metaphor. But I think they're beautiful  don't you  It's just that their beauty is missed because they're so omnipresent  so  I don't know  commonplace  that people don't notice them. They don't notice the beauty  but they don't even notice the clouds unless they get in the way of the sun. And so people think of clouds as things that get in the way. They think of them as the annoying  frustrating obstructions  and then they rush off and do some blue sky thinking. But most people  when you stop to ask them  will admit to harboring a strange sort of fondness for clouds. It's like a nostalgic fondness  and they make them think of their youth. Who here can't remember thinking  well  looking and finding shapes in the clouds when they were kids  You know  when you were masters of daydreaming  Aristophanes  the ancient Greek playwright  he described the clouds as the patron godesses of idle fellows two and a half thousand years ago  and you can see what he means. It's just that these days  us adults seem reluctant to allow ourselves the indulgence of just allowing our imaginations to drift along in the breeze  and I think that's a pity. I think we should perhaps do a bit more of it. I think we should be a bit more willing  perhaps  to look at the beautiful sight of the sunlight bursting out from behind the clouds and go   Wait a minute  that's two cats dancing the salsa   Or seeing the big  white  puffy one up there over the shopping center looks like the Abominable Snowman going to rob a bank. They're like nature's version of those inkblot images  you know  that shrinks used to show their patients in the '  s  and I think if you consider the shapes you see in the clouds  you'll save money on psychoanalysis bills. Let's say you're in love. All right  And you look up and what do you see  Right  Or maybe the opposite. You've just been dumped by your partner  and everywhere you look  it's kissing couples. Perhaps you're having a moment of existential angst. You know  you're thinking about your own mortality. And there  on the horizon  it's the Grim Reaper. Or maybe you see a topless sunbather. What would that mean  What would that mean  I have no idea. But one thing I do know is this  The bad press that clouds get is totally unfair. I think we should stand up for them  which is why  a few years ago  I started the Cloud Appreciation Society. Tens of thousands of members now in almost     countries around the world. And all these photographs that I'm showing  they were sent in by members. And the society exists to remind people of this  Clouds are not something to moan about. Far from it. They are  in fact  the most diverse  evocative  poetic aspect of nature. I think  if you live with your head in the clouds every now and then  it helps you keep your feet on the ground. And I want to show you why  with the help of some of my favorite types of clouds. Let's start with this one. It's the cirrus cloud  named after the Latin for a lock of hair. It's composed entirely of ice crystals cascading from the upper reaches of the troposphere  and as these ice crystals fall  they pass through different layers with different winds and they speed up and slow down  giving the cloud these brush stroked appearances  these brush stroke forms known as fall streaks. And these winds up there can be very  very fierce. They can be     miles an hour      miles an hour. These clouds are bombing along  but from all the way down here  they appear to be moving gracefully  slowly  like most clouds. And so to tune into the clouds is to slow down  to calm down. It's like a bit of everyday meditation. Those are common clouds. What about rarer ones  like the lenticularis  the UFO shaped lenticularis cloud  These clouds form in the region of mountains. When the wind passes  rises to pass over the mountain  it can take on a wave like path in the lee of the peak  with these clouds hovering at the crest of these invisible standing waves of air  these flying saucer like forms  and some of the early black and white UFO photos are in fact lenticularis clouds. It's true. A little rarer are the fallstreak holes. All right  This is when a layer is made up of very  very cold water droplets  and in one region they start to freeze  and this freezing sets off a chain reaction which spreads outwards with the ice crystals cascading and falling down below  giving the appearance of jellyfish tendrils down below. Rarer still  the Kelvin Helmholtz cloud. Not a very snappy name. Needs a rebrand. This looks like a series of breaking waves  and it's caused by shearing winds    the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer differ significantly  and in the middle  in between  you get this undulating of the air  and if the difference in those speeds is just right  the tops of the undulations curl over in these beautiful breaking wave like vortices. All right. Those are rarer clouds than the cirrus  but they're not that rare. If you look up  and you pay attention to the sky  you'll see them sooner or later  maybe not quite as dramatic as these  but you'll see them. And you'll see them around where you live. Clouds are the most egalitarian of nature's displays  because we all have a good  fantastic view of the sky. And these clouds  these rarer clouds  remind us that the exotic can be found in the everyday. Nothing is more nourishing  more stimulating to an active  inquiring mind than being surprised  being amazed. It's why we're all here at TED  right  But you don't need to rush off away from the familiar  across the world to be surprised. You just need to step outside  pay attention to what's so commonplace  so everyday  so mundane that everybody else misses it. One cloud that people rarely miss is this one  the cumulonimbus storm cloud. It's what's produces thunder and lightning and hail. These clouds spread out at the top in this enormous anvil fashion stretching    miles up into the atmosphere. They are an expression of the majestic architecture of our atmosphere. But from down below  they are the embodiment of the powerful  elemental force and power that drives our atmosphere. To be there is to be connected in the driving rain and the hail  to feel connected to our atmosphere. It's to be reminded that we are creatures that inhabit this ocean of air. We don't live beneath the sky. We live within it. And that connection  that visceral connection to our atmosphere feels to me like an antidote. It's an antidote to the growing tendency we have to feel that we can really ever experience life by watching it on a computer screen  you know  when we're in a wi fi zone. But the one cloud that best expresses why cloudspotting is more valuable today than ever is this one  the cumulus cloud. Right  It forms on a sunny day. If you close your eyes and think of a cloud  it's probably one of these that comes to mind. All those cloud shapes at the beginning  those were cumulus clouds. The sharp  crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in. And it reminds us of the aimless nature of cloudspotting  what an aimless activity it is. You're not going to change the world by lying on your back and gazing up at the sky  are you  It's pointless. It's a pointless activity  which is precisely why it's so important. The digital world conspires to make us feel eternally busy  perpetually busy. You know  when you're not dealing with the traditional pressures of earning a living and putting food on the table  raising a family  writing thank you letters  you have to now contend with answering a mountain of unanswered emails  updating a Facebook page  feeding your Twitter feed. And cloudspotting legitimizes doing nothing. And sometimes we need   Sometimes we need excuses to do nothing. We need to be reminded by these patron goddesses of idle fellows that slowing down and being in the present  not thinking about what you've got to do and what you should have done  but just being here  letting your imagination lift from the everyday concerns down here and just being in the present  it's good for you  and it's good for the way you feel. It's good for your ideas. It's good for your creativity. It's good for your soul. So keep looking up  marvel at the ephemeral beauty  and always remember to live life with your head in the clouds. Thank you very much. Where do you come from  It's such a simple question  but these days  of course  simple questions bring ever more complicated answers. People are always asking me where I come from  and they're expecting me to say India  and they're absolutely right insofar as     percent of my blood and ancestry does come from India. Except  I've never lived one day of my life there. I can't speak even one word of its more than        dialects. So I don't think I've really earned the right to call myself an Indian. And if  Where do you come from   means  Where were you born and raised and educated   then I'm entirely of that funny little country known as England  except I left England as soon as I completed my undergraduate education  and all the time I was growing up  I was the only kid in all my classes who didn't begin to look like the classic English heroes represented in our textbooks. And if  Where do you come from   means  Where do you pay your taxes  Where do you see your doctor and your dentist   then I'm very much of the United States  and I have been for    years now  since I was a really small child. Except  for many of those years  I've had to carry around this funny little pink card with green lines running through my face identifying me as a permanent alien. I do actually feel more alien the longer I live there. And if  Where do you come from   means  Which place goes deepest inside you and where do you try to spend most of your time   then I'm Japanese  because I've been living as much as I can for the last    years in Japan. Except  all of those years I've been there on a tourist visa  and I'm fairly sure not many Japanese would want to consider me one of them. And I say all this just to stress how very old fashioned and straightforward my background is  because when I go to Hong Kong or Sydney or Vancouver  most of the kids I meet are much more international and multi cultured than I am. And they have one home associated with their parents  but another associated with their partners  a third connected maybe with the place where they happen to be  a fourth connected with the place they dream of being  and many more besides. And their whole life will be spent taking pieces of many different places and putting them together into a stained glass whole. Home for them is really a work in progress. It's like a project on which they're constantly adding upgrades and improvements and corrections. And for more and more of us  home has really less to do with a piece of soil than  you could say  with a piece of soul. If somebody suddenly asks me   Where's your home   I think about my sweetheart or my closest friends or the songs that travel with me wherever I happen to be. And I'd always felt this way  but it really came home to me  as it were  some years ago when I was climbing up the stairs in my parents' house in California  and I looked through the living room windows and I saw that we were encircled by    foot flames  one of those wildfires that regularly tear through the hills of California and many other such places. And three hours later  that fire had reduced my home and every last thing in it except for me to ash. And when I woke up the next morning  I was sleeping on a friend's floor  the only thing I had in the world was a toothbrush I had just bought from an all night supermarket. Of course  if anybody asked me then   Where is your home   I literally couldn't point to any physical construction. My home would have to be whatever I carried around inside me. And in so many ways  I think this is a terrific liberation. Because when my grandparents were born  they pretty much had their sense of home  their sense of community  even their sense of enmity  assigned to them at birth  and didn't have much chance of stepping outside of that. And nowadays  at least some of us can choose our sense of home  create our sense of community  fashion our sense of self  and in so doing maybe step a little beyond some of the black and white divisions of our grandparents' age. No coincidence that the president of the strongest nation on Earth is half Kenyan  partly raised in Indonesia  has a Chinese Canadian brother in law. The number of people living in countries not their own now comes to     million  and that's an almost unimaginable number  but it means that if you took the whole population of Canada and the whole population of Australia and then the whole population of Australia again and the whole population of Canada again and doubled that number  you would still have fewer people than belong to this great floating tribe. And the number of us who live outside the old nation state categories is increasing so quickly  by    million just in the last    years  that soon there will be more of us than there are Americans. Already  we represent the fifth largest nation on Earth. And in fact  in Canada's largest city  Toronto  the average resident today is what used to be called a foreigner  somebody born in a very different country. And I've always felt that the beauty of being surrounded by the foreign is that it slaps you awake. You can't take anything for granted. Travel  for me  is a little bit like being in love  because suddenly all your senses are at the setting marked  on.  Suddenly you're alert to the secret patterns of the world. The real voyage of discovery  as Marcel Proust famously said  consists not in seeing new sights  but in looking with new eyes. And of course  once you have new eyes  even the old sights  even your home become something different. Many of the people living in countries not their own are refugees who never wanted to leave home and ache to go back home. But for the fortunate among us  I think the age of movement brings exhilarating new possibilities. Certainly when I'm traveling  especially to the major cities of the world  the typical person I meet today will be  let's say  a half Korean  half German young woman living in Paris. And as soon as she meets a half Thai  half Canadian young guy from Edinburgh  she recognizes him as kin. She realizes that she probably has much more in common with him than with anybody entirely of Korea or entirely of Germany. So they become friends. They fall in love. They move to New York City. Or Edinburgh. And the little girl who arises out of their union will of course be not Korean or German or French or Thai or Scotch or Canadian or even American  but a wonderful and constantly evolving mix of all those places. And potentially  everything about the way that young woman dreams about the world  writes about the world  thinks about the world  could be something different  because it comes out of this almost unprecedented blend of cultures. Where you come from now is much less important than where you're going. More and more of us are rooted in the future or the present tense as much as in the past. And home  we know  is not just the place where you happen to be born. It's the place where you become yourself. And yet  there is one great problem with movement  and that is that it's really hard to get your bearings when you're in midair. Some years ago  I noticed that I had accumulated one million miles on United Airlines alone. You all know that crazy system  six days in hell  you get the seventh day free. And I began to think that really  movement was only as good as the sense of stillness that you could bring to it to put it into perspective. And eight months after my house burned down  I ran into a friend who taught at a local high school  and he said   I've got the perfect place for you.   Really   I said. I'm always a bit skeptical when people say things like that.  No  honestly   he went on   it's only three hours away by car  and it's not very expensive  and it's probably not like anywhere you've stayed before.   Hmm.  I was beginning to get slightly intrigued.  What is it    Well    Here my friend hemmed and hawed    Well  actually it's a Catholic hermitage.  This was the wrong answer. I had spent    years in Anglican schools  so I had had enough hymnals and crosses to last me a lifetime. Several lifetimes  actually. But my friend assured me that he wasn't Catholic  nor were most of his students  but he took his classes there every spring. And as he had it  even the most restless  distractible  testosterone addled    year old Californian boy only had to spend three days in silence and something in him cooled down and cleared out. He found himself. And I thought   Anything that works for a    year old boy ought to work for me.  So I got in my car  and I drove three hours north along the coast  and the roads grew emptier and narrower  and then I turned onto an even narrower path  barely paved  that snaked for two miles up to the top of a mountain. And when I got out of my car  the air was pulsing. The whole place was absolutely silent  but the silence wasn't an absence of noise. It was really a presence of a kind of energy or quickening. And at my feet was the great  still blue plate of the Pacific Ocean. All around me were     acres of wild dry brush. And I went down to the room in which I was to be sleeping. Small but eminently comfortable  it had a bed and a rocking chair and a long desk and even longer picture windows looking out on a small  private  walled garden  and then       feet of golden pampas grass running down to the sea. And I sat down  and I began to write  and write  and write  even though I'd gone there really to get away from my desk. And by the time I got up  four hours had passed. Night had fallen  and I went out under this great overturned saltshaker of stars  and I could see the tail lights of cars disappearing around the headlands    miles to the south. And it really seemed like my concerns of the previous day vanishing. And the next day  when I woke up in the absence of telephones and TVs and laptops  the days seemed to stretch for a thousand hours. It was really all the freedom I know when I'm traveling  but it also profoundly felt like coming home. And I'm not a religious person  so I didn't go to the services. I didn't consult the monks for guidance. I just took walks along the monastery road and sent postcards to loved ones. I looked at the clouds  and I did what is hardest of all for me to do usually  which is nothing at all. And I started to go back to this place  and I noticed that I was doing my most important work there invisibly just by sitting still  and certainly coming to my most critical decisions the way I never could when I was racing from the last email to the next appointment. And I began to think that something in me had really been crying out for stillness  but of course I couldn't hear it because I was running around so much. I was like some crazy guy who puts on a blindfold and then complains that he can't see a thing. And I thought back to that wonderful phrase I had learned as a boy from Seneca  in which he says   That man is poor not who has little but who hankers after more.  And  of course  I'm not suggesting that anybody here go into a monastery. That's not the point. But I do think it's only by stopping movement that you can see where to go. And it's only by stepping out of your life and the world that you can see what you most deeply care about and find a home. And I've noticed so many people now take conscious measures to sit quietly for    minutes every morning just collecting themselves in one corner of the room without their devices  or go running every evening  or leave their cell phones behind when they go to have a long conversation with a friend. Movement is a fantastic privilege  and it allows us to do so much that our grandparents could never have dreamed of doing. But movement  ultimately  only has a meaning if you have a home to go back to. And home  in the end  is of course not just the place where you sleep. It's the place where you stand. Thank you. Miranda Wang  We're here to talk about accidents. How do you feel about accidents  When we think about accidents  we usually consider them to be harmful  unfortunate or even dangerous  and they certainly can be. But are they always that bad  The discovery that had led to penicillin  for example  is one of the most fortunate accidents of all time. Without biologist Alexander Fleming's moldy accident  caused by a neglected workstation  we wouldn't be able to fight off so many bacterial infections. Jeanny Yao  Miranda and I are here today because we'd like to share how our accidents have led to discoveries. In       we visited the Vancouver Waste Transfer Station and saw an enormous pit of plastic waste. We realized that when plastics get to the dump  it's difficult to sort them because they have similar densities  and when they're mixed with organic matter and construction debris  it's truly impossible to pick them out and environmentally eliminate them. MW  However  plastics are useful because they're durable  flexible  and can be easily molded into so many useful shapes. The downside of this convenience is that there's a high cost to this. Plastics cause serious problems  such as the destruction of ecosystems  the pollution of natural resources  and the reduction of available land space. This picture you see here is the Great Pacific Gyre. When you think about plastic pollution and the marine environment  we think about the Great Pacific Gyre  which is supposed to be a floating island of plastic waste. But that's no longer an accurate depiction of plastic pollution in the marine environment. Right now  the ocean is actually a soup of plastic debris  and there's nowhere you can go in the ocean where you wouldn't be able to find plastic particles. JY  In a plastic dependent society  cutting down production is a good goal  but it's not enough. And what about the waste that's already been produced  Plastics take hundreds to thousands of years to biodegrade. So we thought  you know what  Instead of waiting for that garbage to sit there and pile up  let's find a way to break them down with bacteria. Sounds cool  right  Audience  Yeah. JY  Thank you. But we had a problem. You see  plastics have very complex structures and are difficult to biodegrade. Anyhow  we were curious and hopeful and still wanted to give it a go. MW  With this idea in mind  Jeanny and I read through some hundreds of scientific articles on the Internet  and we drafted a research proposal in the beginning of our grade    year. We aimed to find bacteria from our local Fraser River that can degrade a harmful plasticizer called phthalates. Phthalates are additives used in everyday plastic products to increase their flexibility  durability and transparency. Although they're part of the plastic  they're not covalently bonded to the plastic backbone. As a result  they easily escape into our environment. Not only do phthalates pollute our environment  but they also pollute our bodies. To make the matter worse  phthalates are found in products to which we have a high exposure  such as babies' toys  beverage containers  cosmetics  and even food wraps. Phthalates are horrible because they're so easily taken into our bodies. They can be absorbed by skin contact  ingested  and inhaled. JY  Every year  at least     million pounds of phthalates contaminate our air  water and soil. The Environmental Protection Agency even classified this group as a top priority pollutant because it's been shown to cause cancer and birth defects by acting as a hormone disruptor. We read that each year  the Vancouver municipal government monitors phthalate concentration levels in rivers to assess their safety. So we figured  if there are places along our Fraser River that are contaminated with phthalates  and if there are bacteria that are able to live in these areas  then perhaps  perhaps these bacteria could have evolved to break down phthalates. MW  So we presented this good idea to Dr. Lindsay Eltis at the University of British Columbia  and surprisingly  he actually took us into his lab and asked his graduate students Adam and James to help us. Little did we know at that time that a trip to the dump and some research on the Internet and plucking up the courage to act upon inspiration would take us on a life changing journey of accidents and discoveries. JY  The first step in our project was to collect soil samples from three different sites along the Fraser River. Out of thousands of bacteria  we wanted to find ones that could break down phthalates  so we enriched our cultures with phthalates as the only carbon source. This implied that  if anything grew in our cultures  then they must be able to live off of phthalates. Everything went well from there  and we became amazing scientists.  Laughter  MW  Um... uh  Jeanny. JY  I'm just joking. MW  Okay. Well  it was partially my fault. You see  I accidentally cracked the flask that had contained our third enrichment culture  and as a result  we had to wipe down the incubator room with bleach and ethanol twice. And this is only one of the examples of the many accidents that happened during our experimentation. But this mistake turned out to be rather serendipitous. We noticed that the unharmed cultures came from places of opposite contamination levels  so this mistake actually led us to think that perhaps we can compare the different degradative potentials of bacteria from sites of opposite contamination levels. JY  Now that we grew the bacteria  we wanted to isolate strains by streaking onto mediate plates  because we thought that would be less accident prone  but we were wrong again. We poked holes in our agar while streaking and contaminated some samples and funghi. As a result  we had to streak and restreak several times. Then we monitored phthalate utilization and bacterial growth  and found that they shared an inverse correlation  so as bacterial populations increased  phthalate concentrations decreased. This means that our bacteria were actually living off of phthalates. MW  So now that we found bacteria that could break down phthalates  we wondered what these bacteria were. So Jeanny and I took three of our most efficient strains and then performed gene amplification sequencing on them and matched our data with an online comprehensive database. We were happy to see that  although our three strains had been previously identified bacteria  two of them were not previously associated with phthalate degradation  so this was actually a novel discovery. JY  To better understand how this biodegradation works  we wanted to verify the catabolic pathways of our three strains. To do this  we extracted enzymes from our bacteria and reacted with an intermediate of phthalic acid. MW  We monitored this experiment with spectrophotometry and obtained this beautiful graph. This graph shows that our bacteria really do have a genetic pathway to biodegrade phthalates. Our bacteria can transform phthalates  which is a harmful toxin  into end products such as carbon dioxide  water and alcohol. I know some of you in the crowd are thinking  well  carbon dioxide is horrible  it's a greenhouse gas. But if our bacteria did not evolve to break down phthalates  they would have used some other kind of carbon source  and aerobic respiration would have led it to have end products such as carbon dioxide anyway. We were also interested to see that  although we've obtained greater diversity of bacteria biodegraders from the bird habitat site  we obtained the most efficient degraders from the landfill site. So this fully shows that nature evolves through natural selection. JY  So Miranda and I shared this research at the Sanofi BioGENEius Challenge competition and were recognized with the greatest commercialization potential. Although we're not the first ones to find bacteria that can break down phthalates  we were the first ones to look into our local river and find a possible solution to a local problem. We have not only shown that bacteria can be the solution to plastic pollution  but also that being open to uncertain outcomes and taking risks create opportunities for unexpected discoveries. Throughout this journey  we have also discovered our passion for science  and are currently continuing research on other fossil fuel chemicals in university. We hope that in the near future  we'll be able to create model organisms that can break down not only phthalates but a wide variety of different contaminants. We can apply this to wastewater treatment plants to clean up our rivers and other natural resources. And perhaps one day we'll be able to tackle the problem of solid plastic waste. MW  I think our journey has truly transformed our view of microorganisms  and Jeanny and I have shown that even mistakes can lead to discoveries. Einstein once said   You can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking you used when you created them.  If we're making plastic synthetically  then we think the solution would be to break them down biochemically. Thank you. JY  Thank you. My name is Tom  and I've come here today to come clean about what I do for money. Basically  I use my mouth in strange ways in exchange for cash. I usually do this kind of thing in seedy downtown bars and on street corners  so this mightn't be the most appropriate setting  but I'd like to give you guys a bit of a demonstration about what I do. And now  for my next number  I'd like to return to the classics. We're going to take it back  way back  back into time.   Billie Jean is not my lover     She's just a girl who claims that I am the one     But the kid is not my son   Wassup. Thank you very much  TEDx. If you guys haven't figured it out already  my name's Tom Thum  and I'm a beatboxer  which means all the sounds that you just heard were made entirely using just my voice  and the only thing was my voice. And I can assure you there are absolutely no effects on this microphone whatsoever. And I'm very  very stoked   You guys are just applauding for everything. It's great. Look at this  Mom  I made it  I'm very  very stoked to be here today  representing my kinfolk and all those that haven't managed to make a career out of an innate ability for inhuman noisemaking. Because it is a bit of a niche market  and there's not much work going on  especially where I'm from. You know  I'm from Brisbane  which is a great city to live in. Yeah  All right  Most of Brisbane's here. That's good. You know  I'm from Brizzy  which is a great city to live in  but let's be honest    it's not exactly the cultural hub of the Southern Hemisphere. So I do a lot of my work outside Brisbane and outside Australia  and so the pursuit of this crazy passion of mine has enabled me to see so many amazing places in the world. So I'd like to share with you  if I may  my experiences. So ladies and gentlemen  I would like to take you on a journey throughout the continents and throughout sound itself. We start our journey in the central deserts. India. China. Germany. Party  party  yeah. And before we reach our final destination  ladies and gentlemen  I would like to share with you some technology that I brought all the way from the thriving metropolis of Brisbane. These things in front of me here are called Kaoss Pads  and they allow me to do a whole lot of different things with my voice. For example  the one on the left here allows me to add a little bit of reverb to my sound  which gives me that    flavor. And the other ones here  I can use them in unison to mimic the effect of a drum machine or something like that. I can sample in my own sounds and I can play it back just by hitting the pads here. TEDx. I got way too much time on my hands. And last but not least  the one on my right here allows me to loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop my voice. So with all that in mind  ladies and gentlemen  I would like to take you on a journey to a completely separate part of Earth as I transform the Sydney Opera House into a smoky downtown jazz bar. All right boys  take it away. Ladies and gentlemen  I'd like to introduce you to a very special friend of mine  one of the greatest double bassists I know. Mr. Smokey Jefferson  let's take it for a walk. Come on  baby. All right  ladies and gentlemen  I'd like to introduce you to the star of the show  one of the greatest jazz legends of our time. Music lovers and jazz lovers alike  please give a warm hand of applause for the one and only Mr. Peeping Tom. Take it away. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm going to talk about consciousness. Why consciousness  Well  it's a curiously neglected subject  both in our scientific and our philosophical culture. Now why is that curious  Well  it is the most important aspect of our lives for a very simple  logical reason  namely  it's a necessary condition on anything being important in our lives that we're conscious. You care about science  philosophy  music  art  whatever    it's no good if you're a zombie or in a coma  right  So consciousness is number one. The second reason is that when people do get interested in it  as I think they should  they tend to say the most appalling things. And then  even when they're not saying appalling things and they're really trying to do serious research  well  it's been slow. Progress has been slow. When I first got interested in this  I thought  well  it's a straightforward problem in biology. Let's get these brain stabbers to get busy and figure out how it works in the brain. So I went over to UCSF and I talked to all the heavy duty neurobiologists there  and they showed some impatience  as scientists often do when you ask them embarrassing questions. But the thing that struck me is  one guy said in exasperation  a very famous neurobiologist  he said   Look  in my discipline it's okay to be interested in consciousness  but get tenure first. Get tenure first.  Now I've been working on this for a long time. I think now you might actually get tenure by working on consciousness. If so  that's a real step forward. Okay  now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness  Well  I think it's a combination of two features of our intellectual culture that like to think they're opposing each other but in fact they share a common set of assumptions. One feature is the tradition of religious dualism  Consciousness is not a part of the physical world. It's a part of the spiritual world. It belongs to the soul  and the soul is not a part of the physical world. That's the tradition of God  the soul and immortality. There's another tradition that thinks it's opposed to this but accepts the worst assumption. That tradition thinks that we are heavy duty scientific materialists  Consciousness is not a part of the physical world. Either it doesn't exist at all  or it's something else  a computer program or some damn fool thing  but in any case it's not part of science. And I used to get in an argument that really gave me a stomachache. Here's how it went. Science is objective  consciousness is subjective  therefore there cannot be a science of consciousness. Okay  so these twin traditions are paralyzing us. It's very hard to get out of these twin traditions. And I have only one real message in this lecture  and that is  consciousness is a biological phenomenon like photosynthesis  digestion  mitosis    you know all the biological phenomena    and once you accept that  most  though not all  of the hard problems about consciousness simply evaporate. And I'm going to go through some of them. Okay  now I promised you to tell you some of the outrageous things said about consciousness. One  Consciousness does not exist. It's an illusion  like sunsets. Science has shown sunsets and rainbows are illusions. So consciousness is an illusion. Two  Well  maybe it exists  but it's really something else. It's a computer program running in the brain. Three  No  the only thing that exists is really behavior. It's embarrassing how influential behaviorism was  but I'll get back to that. And four  Maybe consciousness exists  but it can't make any difference to the world. How could spirituality move anything  Now  whenever somebody tells me that  I think  you want to see spirituality move something  Watch. I decide consciously to raise my arm  and the damn thing goes up.  Laughter  Furthermore  notice this  We do not say   Well  it's a bit like the weather in Geneva. Some days it goes up and some days it doesn't go up.  No. It goes up whenever I damn well want it to. Okay. I'm going to tell you how that's possible. Now  I haven't yet given you a definition. You can't do this if you don't give a definition. People always say consciousness is very hard to define. I think it's rather easy to define if you're not trying to give a scientific definition. We're not ready for a scientific definition  but here's a common sense definition. Consciousness consists of all those states of feeling or sentience or awareness. It begins in the morning when you wake up from a dreamless sleep  and it goes on all day until you fall asleep or die or otherwise become unconscious. Dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition. Now  that's the common sense definition. That's our target. If you're not talking about that  you're not talking about consciousness. But they think   Well  if that's it  that's an awful problem. How can such a thing exist as part of the real world   And this  if you've ever had a philosophy course  this is known as the famous mind body problem. I think that has a simple solution too. I'm going to give it to you. And here it is  All of our conscious states  without exception  are caused by lower level neurobiological processes in the brain  and they are realized in the brain as higher level or system features. It's about as mysterious as the liquidity of water. Right  The liquidity is not an extra juice squirted out by the H O molecules. It's a condition that the system is in. And just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior of the molecules  so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being unconscious  depending on the behavior of the molecules. The famous mind body problem is that simple. All right  But now we get into some harder questions. Let's specify the exact features of consciousness  so that we can then answer those four objections that I made to it. Well  the first feature is  it's real and irreducible. You can't get rid of it. You see  the distinction between reality and illusion is the distinction between how things consciously seem to us and how they really are. It consciously seems like there's    I like the French  arc en ciel    it seems like there's an arch in the sky  or it seems like the sun is setting over the mountains. It consciously seems to us  but that's not really happening. But for that distinction between how things consciously seem and how they really are  you can't make that distinction for the very existence of consciousness  because where the very existence of consciousness is concerned  if it consciously seems to you that you are conscious  you are conscious. I mean  if a bunch of experts come to me and say   We are heavy duty neurobiologists and we've done a study of you  Searle  and we're convinced you are not conscious  you are a very cleverly constructed robot   I don't think   Well  maybe these guys are right  you know   I don't think that for a moment  because  I mean  Descartes may have made a lot of mistakes  but he was right about this. You cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness. Okay  that's the first feature of consciousness. It's real and irreducible. You cannot get rid of it by showing that it's an illusion in a way that you can with other standard illusions. Okay  the second feature is this one that has been such a source of trouble to us  and that is  all of our conscious states have this qualitative character to them. There's something that it feels like to drink beer which is not what it feels like to do your income tax or listen to music  and this qualitative feel automatically generates a third feature  namely  conscious states are by definition subjective in the sense that they only exist as experienced by some human or animal subject  some self that experiences them. Maybe we'll be able to build a conscious machine. Since we don't know how our brains do it  we're not in a position  so far  to build a conscious machine. Okay. Another feature of consciousness is that it comes in unified conscious fields. So I don't just have the sight of the people in front of me and the sound of my voice and the weight of my shoes against the floor  but they occur to me as part of one single great conscious field that stretches forward and backward. That is the key to understanding the enormous power of consciousness. And we have not been able to do that in a robot. The disappointment of robotics derives from the fact that we don't know how to make a conscious robot  so we don't have a machine that can do this kind of thing. Okay  the next feature of consciousness  after this marvelous unified conscious field  is that it functions causally in our behavior. I gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand  but how is that possible  How can it be that this thought in my brain can move material objects  Well  I'll tell you the answer. I mean  we don't know the detailed answer  but we know the basic part of the answer  and that is  there is a sequence of neuron firings  and they terminate where the acetylcholine is secreted at the axon end plates of the motor neurons. Sorry to use philosophical terminology here  but when it's secreted at the axon end plates of the motor neurons  a whole lot of wonderful things happen in the ion channels and the damned arm goes up. Now  think of what I told you. One and the same event  my conscious decision to raise my arm has a level of description where it has all of these touchy feely spiritual qualities. It's a thought in my brain  but at the same time  it's busy secreting acetylcholine and doing all sorts of other things as it makes its way from the motor cortex down through the nerve fibers in the arm. Now  what that tells us is that our traditional vocabularies for discussing these issues are totally obsolete. One and the same event has a level of description where it's neurobiological  and another level of description where it's mental  and that's a single event  and that's how nature works. That's how it's possible for consciousness to function causally. Okay  now with that in mind  with going through these various features of consciousness  let's go back and answer some of those early objections. Well  the first one I said was  consciousness doesn't exist  it's an illusion. Well  I've already answered that. I don't think we need to worry about that. But the second one had an incredible influence  and may still be around  and that is   Well  if consciousness exists  it's really something else. It's really a digital computer program running in your brain and that's what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right program. Yeah  forget about the hardware. Any hardware will do provided it's rich enough and stable enough to carry the program.  Now  we know that that's wrong. I mean  anybody who's thought about computers at all can see that that's wrong  because computation is defined as symbol manipulation  usually thought of as zeros as ones  but any symbols will do. You get an algorithm that you can program in a binary code  and that's the defining trait of the computer program. But we know that that's purely syntactical. That's symbolic. We know that actual human consciousness has something more than that. It's got a content in addition to the syntax. It's got a semantics. Now that argument  I made that argument       oh my God  I don't want to think about it   more than    years ago  but there's a deeper argument implicit in what I've told you  and I want to tell you that argument briefly  and that is  consciousness creates an observer independent reality. It creates a reality of money  property  government  marriage  CERN conferences  cocktail parties and summer vacations  and all of those are creations of consciousness. Their existence is observer relative. It's only relative to conscious agents that a piece of paper is money or that a bunch of buildings is a university. Now  ask yourself about computation. Is that absolute  like force and mass and gravitational attraction  Or is it observer relative  Well  some computations are intrinsic. I add two plus two to get four. That's going on no matter what anybody thinks. But when I haul out my pocket calculator and do the calculation  the only intrinsic phenomenon is the electronic circuit and its behavior. That's the only absolute phenomenon. All the rest is interpreted by us. Computation only exists relative to consciousness. Either a conscious agent is carrying out the computation  or he's got a piece of machinery that admits of a computational interpretation. Now that doesn't mean computation is arbitrary. I spent a lot of money on this hardware. But we have this persistent confusion between objectivity and subjectivity as features of reality and objectivity and subjectivity as features of claims. And the bottom line of this part of my talk is this  You can have a completely objective science  a science where you make objectively true claims  about a domain whose existence is subjective  whose existence is in the human brain consisting of subjective states of sentience or feeling or awareness. So the objection that you can't have an objective science of consciousness because it's subjective and science is objective  that's a pun. That's a bad pun on objectivity and subjectivity. You can make objective claims about a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence  and indeed that's what neurologists do. I mean  you have patients that actually suffer pains  and you try to get an objective science of that. Okay  I promised to refute all these guys  and I don't have an awful lot of time left  but let me refute a couple more of them. I said that behaviorism ought to be one of the great embarrassments of our intellectual culture  because it's refuted the moment you think about it. Your mental states are identical with your behavior  Well  think about the distinction between feeling a pain and engaging in pain behavior. I won't demonstrate pain behavior  but I can tell you I'm not having any pains right now. So it's an obvious mistake. Why did they make the mistake  The mistake was   and you can go back and read the literature on this  you can see this over and over   they think if you accept the irreducible existence of consciousness  you're giving up on science. You're giving up on     years of human progress and human hope and all the rest of it. And the message I want to leave you with is  consciousness has to become accepted as a genuine biological phenomenon  as much subject to scientific analysis as any other phenomenon in biology  or  for that matter  the rest of science. Thank you very much. I love paper  and I love technology  and what I do is I make paper interactive. And that's what I say when people ask me what I do  but it really confuses most people  so really  the best way for me to convey it is to take the technology and be creative and create experiences. So I tried to think what I could use for here  and a couple of weeks ago I had a crazy idea that I wanted to print two DJ decks and to try and mix some music. And I'm going to try and show that at the end  and the suspense will be as much mine if it works. And I'm not a DJ  and I'm not a musician  so I'm a little bit scared of that. So I think  I found the best way to describe my journey is just to mention a few little things that have happened to me throughout my life. There's three particular things that I've done  and I'll just describe those first  and then talk about some of my work. So when I was a kid  I was obsessed with wires  and I used to thread them under my carpet and thread them behind the walls and have little switches and little speakers  and I wanted to make my bedroom be interactive but kind of all hidden away. And I was also really interested in wireless as well. So I bought one of those little kits that you could get to make a radio transmitter  and I got an old book and I carved out the inside and I hid it inside there  and then I placed it next to my dad and snuck back to my bedroom and tuned in on the radio so I could eavesdrop. I was not at all interested in what he was saying. It's more that I just liked the idea of an everyday object having something inside and doing something different. Several year later  I managed to successfully fail all of my exams and didn't really leave school with much to show for at all  and my parents  maybe as a reward  bought me what turned out to be a one way ticket to Australia  and I came back home about four years later. I ended up on a farm in the middle of nowhere. It was in far western New South Wales. And this farm was         acres. There were        sheep  and it was about    degrees  or     or so Fahrenheit. And on this farm there was the farmer  his wife  and there was the four year old daughter. And they kind of took me into the farm and showed me what it was like to live and work. Obviously  one of the most important things was the sheep  and so my job was  well  pretty much to do everything  but it was about bringing the sheep back to the homestead. And we'd do that by building fences  using motorbikes and horses  and the sheep would make their way all the way back to the shearing shed for the different seasons. And what I learned was  although at the time  like everyone else  I thought sheep were pretty stupid because they didn't do what we wanted them to do  what I realize now  probably only just in the last few weeks looking back  is the sheep weren't stupid at all. We'd put them in an environment where they didn't want to be  and they didn't want to do what we wanted them to do. So the challenge was to try and get them to do what we wanted them to do by listening to the weather  the lay of the land  and creating things that would let the sheep flow and go where we wanted them to go. Another bunch of years later  I ended up at Cambridge University at the Cavendish Laboratory in the U.K. doing a Ph.D. in physics. My Ph.D. was to move electrons around  one at a time. And I realize   again  it's kind of these realizations looking back as to what I did   I realize now that it was pretty much the same as moving sheep around. It really is. It's just you do it by changing an environment. And that's kind of been a big lesson to me  that you can't act on any object. You change its environment  and the object will flow. So we made it very small  so things were about    nanometers in size  making it very cold  so at liquid helium temperatures  and changing environment by changing the voltage  and the electrons could make flow around a loop one at a time  on and off  a little memory node. And I wanted to go one step further  and I wanted to move one electron on and one electron off. And I was told that I wouldn't be able to do this  which  you know  as we've heard from other people  that's the thing that makes you do it. And I was determined  and I managed to show that I could do that. And a lot of that learning  I think  came from being on that farm  because when I was working on the farm  we'd have to use what was around us  we'd have to use the environment  and there was no such thing as something can't be done  because you're in an environment where  if you can't do what you need to do  you can die  and  you know  I had seen that sort of thing happen. So now my obsession is printing  and I'm really fascinated by the idea of using conventional printing processes  so the types of print that are used to create many of the things around us to make paper and card interactive. When I spoke to some printers when I started doing this and told them what I wanted to do  which was to print conductive inks onto paper  they told me it couldn't be done  again  that kind of favorite thing. So I got about    credit cards and loans and got myself very close to bankruptcy  really  and bought myself this huge printing press  which I had no idea how to use at all. It was about five meters long  and I covered myself and the floor with ink and made a massive mess  but I learned to print. And then I took it back to the printers and showed them what I've done  and they were like   Of course you can do that. Why didn't you come here in the first place   That's always the case. So what we do is we take conventional printing presses  we make conductive inks  and run those through a press  and basically just letting hundreds of thousands of electrons flow through pieces of paper so we can make that paper interactive. And it's pretty simple  really. It's just a collection of things that have been done before  but bringing them together in a different way. So we have a piece of paper with conductive ink on  and then add onto that a small circuit board with a couple of chips  one to run some capacitive touch software  so we know where we've touched it  and the other to run  quite often  some wireless software so the piece of paper can connect. So I'll just describe a couple of things that we've created. There's lots of different things we've created. This is one of them  because I love cake. And this one  it's a large poster  and you touch it and it has a little speaker behind it  and the poster talks to you when you touch it and asks you a series of questions  and it works out your perfect cake. But it doesn't tell you the cake there and then. It uploads a picture  and the reason why it chose that cake for you  to our Facebook page and to Twitter. So we're trying to create that connection between the physical and the digital  but have it not looking on a screen  and just looking like a regular poster. We've worked with a bunch of universities on a project looking at interactive newsprint. So for example  we've created a newspaper  a regular newspaper. You can wear a pair of headphones that are connected to it wirelessly  and when you touch it  you can hear the music that's described on the top  which is something you can't read. You can hear a press conference as well as reading what the editor has determined that press conference was about. And you can press a Facebook  like  button or you can vote on something as well. Something else that we created  and this was an idea that I had a couple of years ago  and so we've done a project on this. It was for funding from the government for user centered design for energy efficient buildings  difficult to say  and something I had no idea what it was when I went into the workshop  but quickly learned. And we wanted to try and encourage people to use energy better. And I really liked the idea that  instead of looking at dials and reading things to say    looking at your energy usage  I wanted to create a poster that was wirelessly connected and had color changing inks on it  and so if your energy usage was trending better  than the leaves would appear and the rabbits would appear and all would be good. And if it wasn't  then there'd be graffiti and the leaves would fall off the trees. So it was trying to make you look after something in your immediate environment  which you don't want to see not looking so good  rather than expecting people to do things in the local environment because of the effect that it has a long way off. And I think  kind of like going back to the farm  it's about how to let people do what you want them to do rather than making people do what you want them to do. Okay. So this is the bit I'm really scared of. So a couple of things I've created are  there's a poster over here that you can play drums on. And I am not a musician. It seemed like a good idea at the time. If anyone wants to try and play drums  then they can. I'll just describe how this works. This poster is wirelessly connected to my cell phone  and when you touch it  it connects to the app. And it has really good response time. It's using Bluetooth    so it's pretty instantaneous. Okay. Thanks. And there's a couple of other things. So this one is like a sound board  so you can touch it  and I just love these horrible noises. Okay  and this is a D.J. turntable. So it's wirelessly linked to my iPad  and this is a software that's running on the iPad. Oh  yes. I just love doing that. I'm not a D.J.  though  but I just always wanted to do that. So I have a crossfader  and I have the two decks. So I've made some new technology  and I love things being creative  and I love working with creative people. So my    year old niece  she's amazing  and she's called Charlotte  and I asked her to record something  and I worked with a friend called Elliot to put some beats together. So this is my niece  Charlotte. Yay  So that's pretty much what I do. I just love bringing technology together  having a lot of fun  being creative. But it's not about the technology. It's just about  I want to create some great experiences. So thank you very much. Francesca Fedeli  Ciao. So he's Mario. He's our son. He was born two and a half years ago  and I had a pretty tough pregnancy because I had to stay still in a bed for  like  eight months. But in the end everything seemed to be under control. So he got the right weight at birth. He got the right Apgar index. So we were pretty reassured by this. But at the end     days later after he was born  we discovered that he had a stroke. As you might know  a stroke is a brain injury. A perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth  and in his case  as you can see  the right part of his brain has gone. So the effect that this stroke could have on Mario's body could be the fact that he couldn't be able to control the left side of his body. Just imagine  if you have a computer and a printer and you want to transmit  to input to print out a document  but the printer doesn't have the right drives  so the same is for Mario. It's just like  he would like to move his left side of his body  but he's not able to transmit the right input to move his left arm and left leg. So life had to change. We needed to change our schedule. We needed to change the impact that this birth had on our life. Roberto D'Angelo  As you may imagine  unfortunately  we were not ready. Nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities  and as many questions as possible started to come to our minds. And that has been really a tough time. Questions  some basics  like  you know  why did this happen to us  And what went wrong  Some more tough  like  really  what will be the impact on Mario's life  I mean  at the end  will he be able to work  Will he be able to be normal  And  you know  as a parent  especially for the first time  why is he not going to be better than us  And this  indeed  really is tough to say  but a few months later  we realized that we were really feeling like a failure. I mean  the only real product of our life  at the end  was a failure. And you know  it was not a failure for ourselves in itself  but it was a failure that will impact his full life. Honestly  we went down. I mean we went really down  but at the end  we started to look at him  and we said  we have to react. So immediately  as Francesca said  we changed our life. We started physiotherapy  we started the rehabilitation  and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot. Basically  we spent months doing this with Mario. You have an object  and we showed him how to grab the object. Now  the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains  exactly now  as you watch me doing this  you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do the actions. It looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation. But one day we found that Mario was not looking at our hand. He was looking at us. We were his mirror. And the problem  as you might feel  is that we were down  we were depressed  we were looking at him as a problem  not as a son  not from a positive perspective. And that day really changed our perspective. We realized that we had to become a better mirror for Mario. We restarted from our strengths  and at the same time we restarted from his strengths. We stopped looking at him as a problem  and we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve. And really  this was the change  and from our side  we said   What are our strengths that we really can bring to Mario   And we started from our passions. I mean  at the end  my wife and myself are quite different  but we have many things in common. We love to travel  we love music  we love to be in places like this  and we started to bring Mario with us just to show to him the best things that we can show to him. This short video is from last week. I am not saying    I am not saying it's a miracle. That's not the message  because we are just at the beginning of the path. But we want to share what was the key learning  the key learning that Mario drove to us  and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not only what you miss  and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity. And this is the message that we want to share with you. This is why we are here. Mario  And this is why    And this is why we decided to share the best mirror in the world with him. And we thank you so much  all of you. FF  Thank you. RD  Thank you. Bye. FF  Thank you.  Applause  So if I was to ask you what the connection between a bottle of Tide detergent and sweat was  you'd probably think that's the easiest question that you're going to be asked in Edinburgh all week. But if I was to say that they're both examples of alternative or new forms of currency in a hyperconnected  data driven global economy  you'd probably think I was a little bit bonkers. But trust me  I work in advertising. And I am going to tell you the answer  but obviously after this short break. So a more challenging question is one that I was asked  actually  by one of our writers a couple of weeks ago  and I didn't know the answer  What's the world's best performing currency  It's actually Bitcoin. Now  for those of you who may not be familiar  Bitcoin is a crypto currency  a virtual currency  synthetic currency. It was founded in      by this anonymous programmer using a pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. No one knows who or what he is. He's almost like the Banksy of the Internet. And I'm probably not going to do it proper service here  but my interpretation of how it works is that Bitcoins are released through this process of mining. So there's a network of computers that are challenged to solve a very complex mathematical problem and the person that manages to solve it first gets the Bitcoins. And the Bitcoins are released  they're put into a public ledger called the Blockchain  and then they float  so they become a currency  and completely decentralized  that's the sort of scary thing about this  which is why it's so popular. So it's not run by the authorities or the state. It's actually managed by the network. And the reason that it's proved very successful is it's private  it's anonymous  it's fast  and it's cheap. And you do get to the point where there's some wild fluctuations with Bitcoin. So in one level it went from something like    dollars to      literally in the space of four months  and then crashed and lost half of its value in six hours. And it's currently around that kind of     dollar mark in value. But what it does show is that it's sort of gaining ground  it's gaining respectability. You get services  like Reddit and Wordpress are actually accepting Bitcoin as a payment currency now. And that's showing you that people are actually placing trust in technology  and it's started to trump and disrupt and interrogate traditional institutions and how we think about currencies and money. And that's not surprising  if you think about the basket case that is the E.U. I think there was a Gallup survey out recently that said something like  in America  trust in banks is at an all time low  it's something like    percent. And you can see here some photographs from London where Barclays sponsored the city bike scheme  and some activists have done some nice piece of guerrilla marketing here and doctored the slogans.  Sub prime pedaling.   Barclays takes you for a ride.  These are the more polite ones I could share with you today. But you get the gist  so people have really started to sort of lose faith in institutions. There's a P.R. company called Edelman  they do this very interesting survey every year precisely around trust and what people are thinking. And this is a global survey  so these numbers are global. And what's interesting is that you can see that hierarchy is having a bit of a wobble  and it's all about heterarchical now  so people trust people like themselves more than they trust corporations and governments. And if you look at these figures for the more developed markets like U.K.  Germany  and so on  they're actually much lower. And I find that sort of scary. People are actually trusting businesspeople more than they're trusting governments and leaders. So what's starting to happen  if you think about money  if you sort of boil money down to an essence  it is literally just an expression of value  an agreed value. So what's happening now  in the digital age  is that we can quantify value in lots of different ways and do it more easily  and sometimes the way that we quantify those values  it makes it much easier to create new forms and valid forms of currency. In that context  you can see that networks like Bitcoin suddenly start to make a bit more sense. So if you think we're starting to question and disrupt and interrogate what money means  what our relationship with it is  what defines money  then the ultimate extension of that is  is there a reason for the government to be in charge of money anymore  So obviously I'm looking at this through a marketing prism  so from a brand perspective  brands literally stand or fall on their reputations. And if you think about it  reputation has now become a currency. You know  reputations are built on trust  consistency  transparency. So if you've actually decided that you trust a brand  you want a relationship  you want to engage with the brand  you're already kind of participating in lots of new forms of currency. So you think about loyalty. Loyalty essentially is a micro economy. You think about rewards schemes  air miles. The Economist said a few years ago that there are actually more unredeemed air miles in the world than there are dollar bills in circulation. You know  when you are standing in line in Starbucks     percent of transactions in Starbucks on any one day are actually being made with Starbucks Star points. So that's a sort of Starbucks currency staying within its ecosystem. And what I find interesting is that Amazon has recently launched Amazon coins. So admittedly it's a currency at the moment that's purely for the Kindle. So you can buy apps and make purchases within those apps  but you think about Amazon  you look at the trust barometer that I showed you where people are starting to trust businesses  especially businesses that they believe in and trust more than governments. So suddenly  you start thinking  well Amazon potentially could push this. It could become a natural extension  that as well as buying stuff    take it out of the Kindle    you could buy books  music  real life products  appliances and goods and so on. And suddenly you're getting Amazon  as a brand  is going head to head with the Federal Reserve in terms of how you want to spend your money  what money is  what constitutes money. And I'll get you back to Tide  the detergent now  as I promised. This is a fantastic article I came across in New York Magazine  where it was saying that drug users across America are actually purchasing drugs with bottles of Tide detergent. So they're going into convenience stores  stealing Tide  and a     bottle of Tide is equal to    dollars of crack cocaine or weed. And what they're saying  so some criminologists have looked at this and they're saying  well  okay  Tide as a product sells at a premium. It's    percent above the category average. It's infused with a very complex cocktail of chemicals  so it smells very luxurious and very distinctive  and  being a Procter and Gamble brand  it's been supported by a lot of mass media advertising. So what they're saying is that drug users are consumers too  so they have this in their neural pathways. When they spot Tide  there's a shortcut. They say  that is trust. I trust that. That's quality. So it becomes this unit of currency  which the New York Magazine described as a very oddly loyal crime wave  brand loyal crime wave  and criminals are actually calling Tide  liquid gold.  Now  what I thought was funny was the reaction from the P G spokesperson. They said  obviously tried to dissociate themselves from drugs  but said   It reminds me of one thing and that's the value of the brand has stayed consistent.   Laughter  Which backs up my point and shows he didn't even break a sweat when he said that. So that brings me back to the connection with sweat. In Mexico  Nike has run a campaign recently called  literally  Bid Your Sweat. So you think about  these Nike shoes have got sensors in them  or you're using a Nike FuelBand that basically tracks your movement  your energy  your calorie consumption. And what's happening here  this is where you've actually elected to join that Nike community. You've bought into it. They're not advertising loud messages at you  and that's where advertising has started to shift now is into things like services  tools and applications. So Nike is literally acting as a well being partner  a health and fitness partner and service provider. So what happens with this is they're saying   Right  you have a data dashboard. We know how far you've run  how far you've moved  what your calorie intake  all that sort of stuff. What you can do is  the more you run  the more points you get  and we have an auction where you can buy Nike stuff but only by proving that you've actually used the product to do stuff.  And you can't come into this. This is purely for the community that are sweating using Nike products. You can't buy stuff with pesos. This is literally a closed environment  a closed auction space. In Africa  you know  airtime has become literally a currency in its own right. People are used to  because mobile is king  they're very  very used to transferring money  making payments via mobile. And one of my favorite examples from a brand perspective going on is Vodafone  where  in Egypt  lots of people make purchases in markets and very small independent stores. Loose change  small change is a real problem  and what tends to happen is you buy a bunch of stuff  you're due  say     cents     cents in change. The shopkeepers tend to give you things like an onion or an aspirin  or a piece of gum  because they don't have small change. So when Vodafone came in and saw this problem  this consumer pain point  they created some small change which they call Fakka  which literally sits and is given by the shopkeepers to people  and it's credit that goes straight onto their mobile phone. So this currency becomes credit  which again  is really  really interesting. And we did a survey that backs up the fact that  you know     percent of people in this very crucial demographic in the U.S. were saying that they're comfortable using an independent or branded currency. So that's getting really interesting here  a really interesting dynamic going on. And you think  corporations should start taking their assets and thinking of them in a different way and trading them. And you think  is it much of a leap  It seems farfetched  but when you think about it  in America in       there were       corporations issuing banknotes. There were       kinds of notes in America. And the only thing that stopped that  the government controlled four percent of the supply  and the only thing that stopped it was the Civil War breaking out  and the government suddenly wanted to take control of the money. So government  money  war  nothing changes there  then. So what I'm going to ask is  basically  is history repeating itself  Is technology making paper money feel outmoded  Are we decoupling money from the government  You know  you think about  brands are starting to fill the gaps. Corporations are filling gaps that governments can't afford to fill. So I think  you know  will we be standing on stage buying a coffee    organic  fair trade coffee    next year using TED florins or TED shillings  Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  I'm five years old  and I am very proud. My father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in Ukraine. Inside  it's a smelly  gaping hole in the ground  but outside  it's pearly white formica and it literally gleams in the sun. This makes me feel so proud  so important  that I appoint myself the leader of my little group of friends and I devise missions for us. So we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs and we set them free. Four years earlier  when I was one  after the Chernobyl accident  the rain came down black  and my sister's hair fell out in clumps  and I spent nine months in the hospital. There were no visitors allowed  so my mother bribed a hospital worker. She acquired a nurse's uniform  and she snuck in every night to sit by my side. Five years later  an unexpected silver lining. Thanks to Chernobyl  we get asylum in the U.S. I am six years old  and I don't cry when we leave home and we come to America  because I expect it to be a place filled with rare and wonderful things like bananas and chocolate and Bazooka bubble gum  Bazooka bubble gum with the little cartoon wrappers inside  Bazooka that we'd get once a year in Ukraine and we'd have to chew one piece for an entire week. So the first day we get to New York  my grandmother and I find a penny in the floor of the homeless shelter that my family's staying in. Only  we don't know that it's a homeless shelter. We think that it's a hotel  a hotel with lots of rats. So we find this penny kind of fossilized in the floor  and we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there because regular people don't just lose money. And I hold this penny in the palm of my hand  and it's sticky and rusty  but it feels like I'm holding a fortune. I decide that I'm going to get my very own piece of Bazooka bubble gum. And in that moment  I feel like a millionaire. About a year later  I get to feel that way again when we find a bag full of stuffed animals in the trash  and suddenly I have more toys than I've ever had in my whole life. And again  I get that feeling when we get a knock on the door of our apartment in Brooklyn  and my sister and I find a deliveryman with a box of pizza that we didn't order. So we take the pizza  our very first pizza  and we devour slice after slice as the deliveryman stands there and stares at us from the doorway. And he tells us to pay  but we don't speak English. My mother comes out  and he asks her for money  but she doesn't have enough. She walks    blocks to and from work every day just to avoid spending money on bus fare. Then our neighbor pops her head in  and she turns red with rage when she realizes that those immigrants from downstairs have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza. Everyone's upset. But the pizza is delicious. It doesn't hit me until years later just how little we had. On our    year anniversary of being in the U.S.  we decided to celebrate by reserving a room at the hotel that we first stayed in when we got to the U.S. The man at the front desk laughs  and he says   You can't reserve a room here. This is a homeless shelter.  And we were shocked. My husband Brian was also homeless as a kid. His family lost everything  and at age     he had to live in motels with his dad  motels that would round up all of their food and keep it hostage until they were able to pay the bill. And one time  when he finally got his box of Frosted Flakes back  it was crawling with roaches. But he did have one thing. He had this shoebox that he carried with him everywhere containing nine comic books  two G.I. Joes painted to look like Spider Man and five Gobots. And this was his treasure. This was his own assembly of heroes that kept him from drugs and gangs and from giving up on his dreams. I'm going to tell you about one more formerly homeless member of our family. This is Scarlett. Once upon a time  Scarlet was used as bait in dog fights. She was tied up and thrown into the ring for other dogs to attack so they'd get more aggressive before the fight. And now  these days  she eats organic food and she sleeps on an orthopedic bed with her name on it  but when we pour water for her in her bowl  she still looks up and she wags her tail in gratitude. Sometimes Brian and I walk through the park with Scarlett  and she rolls through the grass  and we just look at her and then we look at each other and we feel gratitude. We forget about all of our new middle class frustrations and disappointments  and we feel like millionaires. Thank you. What do we know about the future  Difficult question  simple answer  nothing. We cannot predict the future. We only can create a vision of the future  how it might be  a vision which reveals disruptive ideas  which is inspiring  and this is the most important reason which breaks the chains of common thinking. There are a lot of people who created their own vision about the future  for instance  this vision here from the early   th century. It says here that this is the ocean plane of the future. It takes only one and a half days to cross the Atlantic Ocean. Today  we know that this future vision didn't come true. So this is our largest airplane which we have  the Airbus A     and it's quite huge  so a lot of people fit in there and it's technically completely different than the vision I've shown to you. I'm working in a team with Airbus  and we have created our vision about a more sustainable future of aviation. So sustainability is quite important for us  which should incorporate social but as well as environmental and economic values. So we have created a very disruptive structure which mimics the design of bone  or a skeleton  which occurs in nature. So that's why it looks maybe a little bit weird  especially to the people who deal with structures in general. But at least it's just a kind of artwork to explore our ideas about a different future. What are the main customers of the future  So  we have the old  we have the young  we have the uprising power of women  and there's one mega trend which affects all of us. These are the future anthropometrics. So our children are getting larger  but at the same time we are growing into different directions. So what we need is space inside the aircraft  inside a very dense area. These people have different needs. So we see a clear need of active health promotion  especially in the case of the old people. We want to be treated as individuals. We like to be productive throughout the entire travel chain  and what we are doing in the future is we want to use the latest man machine interface  and we want to integrate this and show this in one product. So we combined these needs with technology's themes. So for instance  we are asking ourselves  how can we create more light  How can we bring more natural light into the airplane  So this airplane has no windows anymore  for example. What about the data and communication software which we need in the future  My belief is that the airplane of the future will get its own consciousness. It will be more like a living organism than just a collection of very complex technology. This will be very different in the future. It will communicate directly with the passenger in its environment. And then we are talking also about materials  synthetic biology  for example. And my belief is that we will get more and more new materials which we can put into structure later on  because structure is one of the key issues in aircraft design. So let's compare the old world with the new world. I just want to show you here what we are doing today. So this is a bracket of an A    crew rest compartment. It takes a lot of weight  and it follows the classical design rules. This here is an equal bracket for the same purpose. It follows the design of bone. The design process is completely different. At the one hand  we have  .  kilos  and at the other hand  .  kilos. So this technology   D printing  and new design rules really help us to reduce the weight  which is the biggest issue in aircraft design  because it's directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions. Push this idea a little bit forward. So how does nature build its components and structures  So nature is very clever. It puts all the information into these small building blocks  which we call DNA. And nature builds large skeletons out of it. So we see a bottom up approach here  because all the information  as I said  are inside the DNA. And this is combined with a top down approach  because what we are doing in our daily life is we train our muscles  we train our skeleton  and it's getting stronger. And the same approach can be applied to technology as well. So our building block is carbon nanotubes  for example  to create a large  rivet less skeleton at the end of the day. How this looks in particular  you can show it here. So imagine you have carbon nanotubes growing inside a  D printer  and they are embedded inside a matrix of plastic  and follow the forces which occur in your component. And you've got trillions of them. So you really align them to wood  and you take this wood and make morphological optimization  so you make structures  sub structures  which allows you to transmit electrical energy or data. And now we take this material  combine this with a top down approach  and build bigger and bigger components. So how might the airplane of the future look  So we have very different seats which adapt to the shape of the future passenger  with the different anthropometrics. We have social areas inside the aircraft which might turn into a place where you can play virtual golf. And finally  this bionic structure  which is covered by a transparent biopolymer membrane  will really change radically how we look at aircrafts in the future. So as Jason Silva said  if we can imagine it  why not make it so  See you in the future. Thank you. This is an ambucycle. This is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency. It has everything an ambulance has except for a bed. You see the defibrillator. You see the equipment. We all saw the tragedy that happened in Boston. When I was looking at these pictures  it brought me back many years to my past when I was a child. I grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem. When I was six years old  I was walking back from school on a Friday afternoon with my older brother. We were passing by a bus stop. We saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes. The bus was on fire  and many people were hurt and killed. I remembered an old man yelling to us and crying to help us get him up. He just needed someone helping him. We were so scared and we just ran away. Growing up  I decided I wanted to become a doctor and save lives. Maybe that was because of what I saw when I was a child. When I was     I took an EMT course  and I went to volunteer on an ambulance. For two years  I volunteered on an ambulance in Jerusalem. I helped many people  but whenever someone really needed help  I never got there in time. We never got there. The traffic is so bad. The distance  and everything. We never got there when somebody really needed us. One day  we received a call about a seven year old child choking from a hot dog. Traffic was horrific  and we were coming from the other side of town in the north part of Jerusalem. When we got there     minutes later  we started CPR on the kid. A doctor comes in from a block away  stop us  checks the kid  and tells us to stop CPR. That second he declared this child dead. At that moment  I understood that this child died for nothing. If this doctor  who lived one block away from there  would have come    minutes earlier  not have to wait until that siren he heard before coming from the ambulance  if he would have heard about it way before  he would have saved this child. He could have run from a block away. He could have saved this child. I said to myself  there must be a better way. Together with    of my friends    we were all EMTs   we decided  let's protect our neighborhood  so when something like that happens again  we will be there running to the scene a lot before the ambulance. So I went over to the manager of the ambulance company and I told him   Please  whenever you have a call coming into our neighborhood  we have    great guys who are willing to stop everything they're doing and run and save lives. Just alert us by beeper. We'll buy these beepers  just tell your dispatch to send us the beeper  and we will run and save lives.  Well  he was laughing. I was    years old. I was a kid. And he said to me   I remember this like yesterday   he was a great guy  but he said to me   Kid  go to school  or go open a falafel stand. We're not really interested in these kinds of new adventures. We're not interested in your help.  And he threw me out of the room.  I don't need your help   he said. I was a very stubborn kid. As you see now  I'm walking around like crazy  meshugenah. So I decided to use the Israeli very famous technique you've probably all heard of  chutzpah.  Laughter  And the next day  I went and I bought two police scanners  and I said   The hell with you  if you don't want to give me information  I'll get the information myself.  And we did turns  who's going to listen to the radio scanners. The next day  while I was listening to the scanners  I heard about a call coming in of a    year old man hurt by a car only one block away from me on the main street of my neighborhood. I ran there by foot. I had no medical equipment. When I got there  the    year old man was lying on the floor  blood was gushing out of his neck. He was on Coumadin. I knew I had to stop his bleeding or else he would die. I took off my yarmulke  because I had no medical equipment  and with a lot of pressure  I stopped his bleeding. He was bleeding from his neck. When the ambulance arrived    minutes later  I gave them over a patient who was alive. When I went to visit him two days later  he gave me a hug and was crying and thanking me for saving his life. At that moment  when I realized this is the first person I ever saved in my life after two years volunteering in an ambulance  I knew this is my life's mission. So today     years later  we have United Hatzalah.  Hatzalah  means  rescue   for all of you who don't know Hebrew. I forgot I'm not in Israel. So we have thousands of volunteers who are passionate about saving lives  and they're spread all around  so whenever a call comes in  they just stop everything and go and run and save a life. Our average response time today went down to less than three minutes in Israel. I'm talking about heart attacks  I'm talking about car accidents  God forbid bomb attacks  shootings  whatever it is  even a woman   o'clock in the morning falling in her home and needs someone to help her. Three minutes  we'll have a guy with his pajamas running to her house and helping her get up. The reasons why we're so successful are because of three things. Thousands of passionate volunteers who will leave everything they do and run to help people they don't even know. We're not there to replace ambulances. We're just there to get the gap between the ambulance call until they arrive. And we save people that otherwise would not be saved. The second reason is because of our technology. You know  Israelis are good in technology. Every one of us has on his phone  no matter what kind of phone  a GPS technology done by NowForce  and whenever a call comes in  the closest five volunteers get the call  and they actually get there really quick  and navigated by a traffic navigator to get there and not waste time. And this is a great technology we use all over the country and reduce the response time. And the third thing are these ambucycles. These ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels. We don't transfer people  but we stabilize them  and we save their lives. They never get stuck in traffic. They could even go on a sidewalk. They never  literally  get stuck in traffic. That's why we get there so fast. A few years after I started this organization  in a Jewish community  two Muslims from east Jerusalem called me up. They ask me to meet. They wanted to meet with me. Muhammad Asli and Murad Alyan. When Muhammad told me his personal story  how his father     years old  collapsed at home  had a cardiac arrest  and it took over an hour for an ambulance arrive  and he saw his father die in front of his eyes  he asked me   Please start this in east Jerusalem.  I said to myself  I saw so much tragedy  so much hate  and it's not about saving Jews. It's not about saving Muslims. It's not about saving Christians. It's about saving people. So I went ahead  full force    and I started United Hatzalah in east Jerusalem  and that's why the names United and Hatzalah match so well. We started hand in hand saving Jews and Arabs. Arabs were saving Jews. Jews were saving Arabs. Something special happened. Arabs and Jews  they don't always get along together  but here in this situation  the communities  literally  it's an unbelievable situation that happened  the diversities  all of a sudden they had a common interest  Let's save lives together. Settlers were saving Arabs and Arabs were saving settlers. It's an unbelievable concept that could work only when you have such a great cause. And these are all volunteers. No one is getting money. They're all doing it for the purpose of saving lives. When my own father collapsed a few years ago from a cardiac arrest  one of the first volunteers to arrive to save my father was one of these Muslim volunteers from east Jerusalem who was in the first course to join Hatzalah. And he saved my father. Could you imagine how I felt in that moment  When I started this organization  I was    years old. I never imagined that one day I'd be speaking at TEDMED. I never even knew what TEDMED was then. I don't think it existed  but I never imagined  I never imagined that it's going to go all around  it's going to spread around  and this last year we started in Panama and Brazil. All I need is a partner who is a little meshugenah like me  passionate about saving lives  and willing to do it. And I'm actually starting it in India very soon with a friend who I met in Harvard just a while back. Hatzalah actually started in Brooklyn by a Hasidic Jew years before us in Williamsburg  and now it's all over the Jewish community in New York  even Australia and Mexico and many other Jewish communities. But it could spread everywhere. It's very easy to adopt. You even saw these volunteers in New York saving lives in the World Trade Center. Last year alone  we treated in Israel         people. Forty two thousand of them were life threatening situations. And we made a difference. I guess you could call this a lifesaving flash mob  and it works. When I look all around here  I see lots of people who would go an extra mile  run an extra mile to save other people  no matter who they are  no matter what religion  no matter who  where they come from. We all want to be heroes. We just need a good idea  motivation and lots of chutzpah  and we could save millions of people that otherwise would not be saved. Thank you very much.   Oedipus Rex     The Lion King     Titus     Frida     The Magic Flute     Across The Universe   Julie Taymor  Thank you. Thank you very much. That's a few samples of the theater  opera and films that I have done over the last    years. But what I'd like to begin with right now is to take you back to a moment that I went through in Indonesia  which is a seminal moment in my life and  like all myths  these stories need to be retold and told  lest we forget them. And when I'm in the turbulent times  as we know  that I am right now  through the crucible and the fire of transformation  which is what all of you do  actually. Anybody who creates knows there's that point where it hasn't quite become the phoenix or the burnt char. And I am right there on the edge  which I'll tell you about  another story. I want to go back to Indonesia where I was about        years  a long time ago  on a fellowship. And I found myself  after two years there and performing and learning  on the island of Bali  on the edge of a crater  Gunung Batur. And I was in a village where there was an initiation ceremony for the young men  a rite of passage. Little did I know that it was mine as well. And as I sat in this temple square under this gigantic beringin banyan tree  in the dark  there was no electricity  just the full moon  down in this empty square  and I heard the most beautiful sounds  like a Charles Ives concert as I listened to the gamelan music from all the different villagers that came for this once every five years ceremony. And I thought I was alone in the dark under this tree. And all of a sudden  out of the dark  from the other end of the square  I saw the glint of mirrors lit by the moon. And these    old men who I'd seen before all of a sudden stood up in these full warrior costumes with the headdress and the spears  and no one was in the square  and I was hidden in the shadows. No one was there  and they came out  and they did this incredible dance.  Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhahahahaha.  And they moved their bodies and they came forward  and the lights bounced off these costumes. And I've been in theater since I was    years old  and performing  creating  and I went   Who are they performing for with these elaborate costumes  these extraordinary headdresses   And I realized that they were performing for God  whatever that means. But somehow  it didn't matter about the publicity. There was no money involved. It wasn't going to be written down. It was no news. And there were these incredible artists that felt for me like an eternity as they performed. The next moment  as soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows  a young man with a propane lantern came on  hung it up on a tree  set up a curtain. The village square was filled with hundreds of people. And they put on an opera all night long. Human beings needed the light. They needed the light to see. So what I gained and gathered from this incredible  seminal moment in my life as a young artist was that you must be true to what you believe as an artist all the way through  but you also have to be aware that the audience is out there in our lives at this time  and they also need the light. And it's this incredible balance that I think that we walk when we are creating something that is breaking ground  that's trying to do something you've never seen before  that imaginary world where you actually don't know where you're going to end up  that's the fine line on the edge of a crater that I have walked my whole life. What I would like to do now is to tell you a little bit about how I work. Let's take  The Lion King.  You saw many examples of my work up there  but it's one that people know. I start with the notion of the ideograph. An ideograph is like a brush painting  a Japanese brush painting. Three strokes  you get the whole bamboo forest. I go to the concept of  The Lion King  and I say   What is the essence of it  What is the abstraction  If I were to reduce this entire story into one image  what would it be   The circle. The circle. It's so obvious. The circle of life. The circle of Mufasa's mask. The circle that  when we come to Act II and there's a drought  how do you express drought  It's a circle of silk on the floor that disappears into the hole in the stage floor. The circle of life comes in the wheels of the gazelles that leap. And you see the mechanics. And being a theater person  what I know and love about the theater is that when the audience comes in and they suspend their disbelief  when you see men walking or women walking with a platter of grass on their heads  you know it's the savanna. You don't question that. I love the apparent truth of theater. I love that people are willing to fill in the blanks. The audience is willing to say   Oh  I know that's not a real sun. You took pieces of sticks. You added silk to the bottom. You suspended these pieces. You let it fall flat on the floor. And as it rises with the strings  I see that it's a sun. But the beauty of it is that it's just silk and sticks. And in a way  that is what makes it spiritual. That's what moves you. It's not the actual literal sunrise that's coming. It's the art of it. So in the theater  as much as the story is critical and the book and the language  the telling of the story  how it's told  the mechanics  the methods that you use  is equal to the story itself. And I'm one who loves high tech and low tech. So I could go from    For instance  I'll show you some  Spider Man  later  these incredible machines that move people along. But the fact is  without the dancer who knows how to use his body and swing on those wires  it's nothing. So now I'm going to show you some clips from the other big project of my life this year   The Tempest.  It's a movie. I did  The Tempest  on a stage three times in the theater since       '    and I love the play. I did it always with a male Prospero. And all of a sudden  I thought   Well  who am I gonna get to play Prospero  Why not Helen Mirren  She's a great actor. Why not   And this material really did work for a woman equally as well. So now  let's take a look at some of the images from  The Tempest.  Ariel  I boarded the king's ship. In every cabin  I flamed amazement. Prospera  At first sight  they have changed eyes. Miranda  Do you love me  Ferdinand  Beyond all limit. HM  They are both in either's powers. Trinculo  Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows. Looking for business  governor  Caliban  Hast thou not dropped from heaven  Stephano  Out of the moon  I do assure thee. Prospera  Caliban  Caliban  This island is mine. Prospera  For this  be sure  tonight thou shalt have cramps. Antonio  Here lies your brother no better than the earth he lies upon. Sebastian  Draw thy sword. And I  the king  shall love thee. Prospera  I will plague them all  even to roaring. Ariel  I have made you mad. Prospera  We are such stuff as dreams are made on. and our little life is rounded with a sleep. JT  Okay. So I went from theater  doing  The Tempest  on the stage in a very low budget production many years ago  and I love the play  and I also think it's Shakespeare's last play  and it really lends itself  as you can see  to cinema. But I'm just going to give you a little example about how one stages it in theater and then how one takes that same idea or story and moves it into cinema. The ideograph that I talked to you about before  what is it for  The Tempest   What  if I were to boil it down  would be the one image that I could hang my hat on for this  And it was the sand castle  the idea of nurture versus nature  that we build these civilizations    she speaks about it at the end  Helen Mirren's Prospera    we build them  but under nature  under the grand tempest  these cloud capped towers  these gorgeous palaces will fade and there will    leave not a rack behind. So in the theater  I started the play  it was a black sand rake  white cyc  and there was a little girl  Miranda  on the horizon  building a drip castle  a sand castle. And as she was there on the edge of that stage  two stagehands all in black with watering cans ran along the top and started to pour water on the sand castle  and the sand castle started to drip and sink  but before it did  the audience saw the black clad stagehands. The medium was apparent. It was banal. We saw it. But as they started to pour the water  the light changed from showing you the black clad stagehands to focusing  this rough magic that we do in theater  it focused right on the water itself. And all of a sudden  the audience's perspective changes. It becomes something magically large. It becomes the rainstorm. The masked actors  the puppeteers  they disappear  and the audience makes that leap into this world  into this imaginary world of  The Tempest  actually happening. Now the difference when I went and did it in the cinema  I started the actual movie with a close up of a sand castle  a black sand castle  and what cinema can do is  by using camera  perspective  and also long shots and close ups  it started on a close up of the sand castle  and as it pulled away  you saw that it was a miniature sitting in the palm of the girl's hands. And so I could play with the medium  and why I move from one medium to another is to be able to do this. Now I'm going to take you to  Spider Man.  I can soar away from this.   JT  We're trying to do everything in live theater that you can't do in two dimensions in film and television. PP    Rise above yourself and take control.   George Tsypin  We're looking at New York from a Spider Man point of view. Spider Man is not bound by gravity. Manhattan in the show is not bound by gravity either. PP    Be yourself and rise above it all.   Ensemble    Sock  Pow      Slam  Scratch    Danny Ezralow  I don't want you to even think there's a choreographer. It's real  what's happening. I prefer you to see people moving  and you're going   Whoa  what was that   JT  If I give enough movement in the sculpture  and the actor moves their head  you feel like it's alive. It's really comic book live. It's a comic book coming alive. Bono  They're mythologies. They're modern myths  these comic book heroes. PP    They believe.   JT  Ohhhh. What was that  Circus  rock 'n' roll  drama. What the hell are we doing up there on that stage  Well  one last story  very quickly. After I was in that village  I crossed the lake  and I saw that the volcano was erupting on the other side  Gunung Batur  and there was a dead volcano next to the live volcano. I didn't think I'd be swallowed by the volcano  and I am here. But it's very easy to climb up  is it not  You hold on to the roots  you put your foot in the little rocks and climb up there  and you get to the top  and I was with a good friend who was an actor  and we said   Let's go up there. Let's see if we can come close to the edge of that live volcano.  And we climbed up and we got to the very top  and we're on the edge  on this precipice  Roland disappears into the sulfur smoke at the volcano at the other end  and I'm up there alone on this incredible precipice. Did you hear the lyrics  I'm on the precipice looking down into a dead volcano to my left. To my right is sheer shale. It's coming off. I'm in thongs and sarongs. It was many years ago. And no hiking boots. And he's disappeared  this mad French gypsy actor  off in the smoke  and I realize  I can't go back the way that I've come. I can't. So I throw away my camera. I throw away my thongs  and I looked at the line straight in front of me  and I got down on all fours like a cat  and I held with my knees to either side of this line in front of me  for    yards or    feet  I don't know. The wind was massively blowing  and the only way I could get to the other side was to look at the line straight in front of me. I know you've all been there. I'm in the crucible right now. It's my trial by fire. It's my company's trials by fire. We survive because our theme song is  Rise Above.  Boy falls from the sky  rise above. It's right there in the palm of both of our hands  of all of my company's hands. I have beautiful collaborators  and we as creators only get there all together. I know you understand that. And you just stay going forward  and then you see this extraordinary thing in front of your eyes. Thank you.
